TL:DR? See ConclusionNOTE: Some of the PROS and CONS of my Red Alert 3 Review are still applicable in the expansion. You can read it here: http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/recommended/17480INTRODUCTION:Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3 Uprising is the stand-alone expansion to the RTS game 'Red Alert 3', which has been released by Electronic Arts in 2008. This expansion features new units, new campaign missions, new skirmish maps and new live action characters (most notably, professional wrestler Richard Morgan ""Ric"" Fliehr)The story takes place where the events of Red Alert 3 resulted in a canonical Allied Victory. The Soviet campaign involves the Soviets attempting to stop the European Union President's plans to remove the Soviet Union from history with the help of an Allied Military Contractor called FutureTech. The Allied campaign focuses on pacifying remaining Imperial Commanders who still resist allied occupation of Japan. The Empire campaign is based on defeating Soviet Commanders who seeks to have a land grab of Imperial Territory while the Empire is vulnerable. A special campaign is also available where the player takes on the role of Imperial Commando Yuriko Omega and her origin story.PROS:+ New Campaign Missions but...(See CON #1)+ Yuriko Campaign is an interesting twist to the C&C formula although borrowing heavily from StarCraft's 'single unit' missions+ New units that are both powerful and fun to use+ Fun new game mode: 'Commander's Challange'+ Stand-aloneCONS:- Short campaign with under developed plots- Campaign coop (even the coop AI) was removed- New units caused severe balance issues that resulted in...- Removal of Multiplayer, both LAN and Online- Removal of Skirmish live action cutscenes (which I found very entertaining in the base game)- Live action cutscenes were lazily made- Forces players to play the Soviet Campaign first before unlocking the 2 other campaigns (which was not the case with Red Alert 3)- Expensive for an expansion with several features removed from the base game (like multiplayer)CONCLUSION:NICE LITTLE EXPANSION but does not live up to the quality or scale of Red Alert 2's expansion; Yuri's Revenge. Red Alert 3 Uprising is not a bad game  if you like the single player experience like myself . Despite having said that, the game feels as though it was rushed with many of its elements (particularly the Campaign), being half baked. The removal of Multiplayer, caused by poorly balanced units, is one of the greatest sins anyone can do to an RTS game, even if its just an expansion. This prompts me to say that Red Alert 3 Uprising does not warrant its full price considering that it's currently priced the same as the Base game. BUY IT on a SALE or BUNDLE but NEVER at FULL PRICE.Why do I still RECOMMEND this game? Well I particularly enjoyed the Commander's Challenge (more than the Campaign actually) It gave me several hours of fun. I DO NOT RECOMMENDED this game if you're looking to play Multiplayer.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												The Yuriko Omega storyline is predictable, but the gameplay mechanics are a fun new way of playing Red Alert. Overpowering droves of enemies, some of them capable of leveling entire bases, is satisfying mindless fun :D			",67,7,1,6,7,1,7

												Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3 - Uprising, is a standalone expansion to Red Alert 3.  The story takes place after the events of Red Alert 3. In campaign mode, no matter which campaign you choose, the Empire of the Rising Sun, and the Soviets have surrendered to the Allies, if you aren't a fan of the allies, you might be disappointed. The campaigns seem a little short too, with only a couple of missions per campaign, unlike previous Red Alert games. This would have been better as a dlc to the original Red Alert 3, rather than a standalone. There are a bunch of new mapsfor skirmish mode, and some new weapons as well as units you can play around with. Uprising, also comes with the Commanders Challenge, which could be purchased as an additional stand alone, but without the campaign mode of uprising.  I have a mixed-bag of feelings about this game, but I am a fan of the Red Alert series overall. Because of the new content and the commander's challenge mode, which has way more content then the campaigns, I think Red Alert 3: Uprising redeems itself. As I said, I think it would have made a better DLC to Red Alert 3, than a stand alone, but it's still a decent play.			",479,176,24,74,66,6,86

												7/10First thing first. It DOSEN'T SUPPORT multiplayer. If you want play on-line, buy the red alert 3.It has ""challenge mode"" which is fun and really hard. Well, I cleared all the infamous AOE3 and AOE2 campaigns on hard and that's nothing compared to this one. It will drive you crazy if you're going to clear ""on time""missions. (The AI is insane, you can belive me) You're going to think a lot while playing it :)Great challenge mode indeed but personally, the campaign was'nt that good.If you looking for intense and challenging game than you may go for it. Otherwise you may be better off not buying it.			",230,45,2,55,31,1,55

												I tried the first game of Red Alert(Strategy ofcourse), many years ago...I was addicted to it and i just couldn't stop, from that game i'm even remembering my life!This game brings those memories back to me as it was yesterday that happened. One of the best strategy games i have ever tried on my life! If you like COD/Battlefield games you will not enjoy this one, but if you love strategy games, this one is just for you!Also the characters are real actors, so you won't see any game made face but real face. For those who are new on gaming, this game could be just a real life strategy!Good luck to whoever tries this one.I'm strongly recommending it.			",175,43,9,24,12,1,44

												Red Alert 3 Uprising is one of those games you either love or hate. I for one love it, and let me tell you exactly why.Let's get this out of the way first; this stand alone expansion has no multiplayer component. None. Not even coop. There are some unit in this game that upset the balance to such a degree that it would be unethical to let anyone play against one another. If you can get over this, then you'll like the game. If you really need this mulitplayer thing, then you might want to pass.With that out of the way, let me describe Uprising for you. Uprising is an exercise in scenario building. It tries to create the coolest kinds of single player levels seen in RTS ever with ridiculous units and abilities that make a game of Warcraft seem tame. Image transforming tanks, ice beams, rockets everywhere, robots, tanks that eat buildings and giant floating heads with death rays that make any unit or building completely worthless. It does not end there. Each civ gets a few new units. The allies get to parade their new giant gunship and otherworldly tanks, as well as freeze troopers. The soviets have to do with a complete hack of an infantry killer, and some fast mechs. No, for the really cool stuff you need to check with the empire, who come rolling onto the scene with laser archers, robots with swords and the aforementioned flying death ray. Plenty of cool stuff to go around and no stupid balance that is holding any of it back. The game features three gamemodes. The campaigns, that come with some really impressive production value. General skirmishes. Finally, the commanders challenge. Where you have to overcome extremely strong AI opponents with limited units. Each victory gives you access to new units to use in your conquest. It is extremely hard, and fiendishly challenging, but funny and rewarding. I can reccomend this expansion. It's a blast while it lasts, and it provides some of that cartoonish fun that you don't get in any of the newer RTS games. If this is on sale, just shell those two bucks and indulge in some robot vs tank tomfoolery. You know you want to.			",166,8,12,16,11,3,15

Posted: May 18, 2016
												This game (as stated by many reviewers) is a standalone singleplayer ""update"" for Command & Conquer Red Alert 3.As a long time fan of the C&C series I was extremely excited when I heard of Red Alert 3's development. Although Westwood Studios (former publisher of the C&C Red Alert series) was liquified back in 2002/early 2003, not long after RA2 Yuris Revenge released, some of the crew assimilated into EA. Although this was a sad time, when RA3 was announced I had high hopes and Id like to think that RA3 hit almost all the expectations.And then I saw this. I had been a little caught up with exams and such when this was originally released so I completely missed it and stumbled upon it on Steam a few weeks ago. I gleefully wrung my hands together and bought it, excited at the chance to try some new tactics and try out the new units and maps.  Here is where the real review starts:   Campaign The campaigns are short. Four missions per story and they are very basic missions although I personally found most fairly challenging, more so than the base game. However whilst playing most missions I felt extremely overwhelmed by the seemingly unstoppable enemy forces. For example in one Allied story mission you are expected to transport an MCV to a set location then set up and defeat any Empire units and bases in the vicinty. The transportation part was simple enough and once the base is set you are introduced to a new unit The Harbringer, a large AC130 esque ship with some capabilities to deal with ground units. Suddenly all hell breaks loose, as soon as I was given control of the base, resources and units I instantly come under attack from a (almost cheat worthy) slew of enemy units when Ive had less than 2 minutes to begin producing anything. Needless to say I was slaughtered and had to try the mission at least 4 times before successfully finishing it.   Yuriko's 'backstory' Before I knew it I had burned my way through all the main army stories leading me to play the equally as short story of Yuriko Omega (that hero unit from the Empire that was kinda meh). Her story was taken in a different approach than the others as it was made into a Dungeon Siege esque 'minigame'. You have different abilites each mapped to 1-4 of your keyboard numbers. This was rather enjoyable and the new take on the gameplay was refreshing. Like the main armies her story was short but even more so than the mains as it was only 3 missions (2 of which take place in the same location).After I finished her story (which still gave her barely any backstory at all it felt more like a filler episode from Naruto) I decided to head into Commander Challenge mode.  Commander Challenge This is a new mode implemented specifically for this standalone. This mode allows to you play missions with any army but limits what units you have until you beat certain missions to unlock. Each mission has a par time and scores depending on various factors, giving it plenty of replayability if you are one of those people who like to beat record times and such. I however am not and burned my through it, enjoying the story mission feel of the challenges but also the limitations made me test new tactics. Skirmish Now the part I really wanted to get too. The skirmish mode. Sucks♥♥♥♥♥in this game.Although no description in the game says so there are quite a few new maps in the game which offer new skirmish fun...HOWEVER MOST OF THE BASE GAME SKIRMISH MAPS HAVE BEEN REPLACED. There a few select maps taken from RA3 but most are new maps which are barely creative, fairly generic and small. Even the 6 player maps are tiny, which can be fun if hectic battles where you can barely build anything is fun. Additionally the co-commander features have been completely removed. Gone. Disappeared from existence.Even in Skirmish mode where you could have Ai teammates to take on other enemy AI they have completely removed the team based battles. I understood that they removed it for story but removing it from the standalone altogether? Little bit OTT if you ask me. Multiplayer And I bet you're wondering where the multiplayer part is............well there isnt one. Multiplayer isnt a thing in this standalone for some unknown reason. They decided to isolate the multiplayer community for this game because ""♥♥♥♥ you we're EA"". Not that many people played online anyway.  Pro/Con summary  So to sum up the points  Pros Enjoyable gameplay Challenging story missions New units are fun to play with Commander Challenge is challenging Some returning live action actors from RA3 Cons Short stories Sometimes overwhelmingly difficult AI seem to be low key cheating (far superior rate of income/unit production) *Story only* Skirmish maps have barely any variety Removes most of the good maps from RA3 Completely removes game mechanic from previous game (Co-commander feature) No multiplayer feature (Lan or internet)  Final Summary  Overall this game was a bit of a disappointment. It seemed to take so many good parts from RA and just remove them altogether whilst compensating for said removal with new units, barely thought through stories and generic/boring maps. Although there are some good points like the Challenge mode and the dungeon crawler Yuriko story this game should of just been a macro transaction for RA3, adding all those features onto the base game. I would recommend that you go buy RA3 base game instead of this and hope that there is a mod which adds the new maps and units into the base game.But hey ho just another game series that EA decided to ♥♥♥♥.

												Tutorial to how to make RA3 - Uprising. Step 1: finish developing RA3, one of the most ambitious RTSes of 2008. Step 2: take all your assets, ideas that couldn't fit in the original game or haven't made the deadline and put them together. Step 3: craft a really lame and superficial campaign for each fraction as a wrap-around. Step 4: add Yuriko to the mix. Thus, Command & Conquer Red Alert 3 - Uprising has been born.Uprising isn't a bad game. However, it wants to do so many thing at once that it can't achieve a single one of them (well, except one: Yuriko). All three factions got a new mini-campaign which takes place after the original game with the Allies winning the war over the Soviets and the Empire. None of the stories are overlapping this time like they were in the original game. There are 10 levels for the three factions combined and all of them are hard as hell. Even on medium difficulty you will be constantly attacked by the enemy on land, water and in the air. Sometimes the game gets so difficult that it will be annoyingly frustrating. Some levels may require over 1-2 hours to complete on medium and not because they are so long, but because you have to retry constantly. The basic gameplay structure hasn't changed, but some new units were introduced on all 3 sides. Some of them are really unconventional and they can upset your good ol' strategies. The building system remained the same, but less than half of the stages start with base building. On most of them you start off with a smaller group and you have to complete some tasks before HQ can send you an MCV. These commando missions are fresh at first but they very quickly became annoying...for all the players crying out loud: just give us a base and let us build an army! We don't want to play commando with conscripts and attack dogs against tanks and robots! This and the annoying difficulty will make you believe that the creators used these cheap tricks to make the game last longer. Even though it will last longer, they will remain cheap tricks.On the visual side the game looks great. Water movement is excellent, explosions are beautiful and devastating. You just can't get enough of a dozen Apocalypse Tank annihilating the enemy base. Splendid! Anyone who has seen a Red Alert game knows that its' cutscenes are performed by flesh and blood human actors and actresses. Also anyone can tell that these cutscenes are missing one thing only and that is good acting. The actors are still unconvincing and disbelieving, not that the words that were put into their mouths are any better. Sometimes you just wish the next cut-scene will be a lot shorter and without any speech at all. The debrief ladies look hot though and the short skirt of that Gemma Atkinson's won't disappoint you.When you finish the campaigns you can try the most innovative and fun part of the game. Yuriko's mini-campaign. She is a psyche with mental powers capable of devastating armies. You have access to 4 powers at one time. After using a power you have to wait for the cooldown time. You can brainwash enemies to fight on your side, create black holes that suck everything inside or simply heal yourself with her powers. This game mode is really interesting, intriguing and its the greatest fun you can find in this game.When you are done with the mini-campaigns you can play Skirmish, where nothing has changed from the original or play Challenge missions which are actually a lot like Skirmish maps only with cutscenes and a limited arsenal. When you beat a challenge new ones will appear and by beating them you can unlock new units to fight with. Before starting a map you can always select your fraction. It's nothing groundbreaking but thanks to the limited arsenal and gameplay tweaks this game mode can engage lots of players. And finally, there is the multiplayer...oh...wait...there aren't any MP or Co-op modes in this game! No MP in an RTS game. Well played EA, just well played!Rating: 57/100; Replay Value: 3/5; To Beat: 10-12 hours; Played on: medium/easy.			",111,19,6,11,6,1,12

												I never got the chance to play uprising since it came out in 2009. Finnaly get the chance to play this after sooo many years was a wonderful experience. The graphics and music are the same style as the original RA3 but it added some new story missions for the 3 faction and 1 school-girl rampage story.8 long years and still no new red alret game after this and this is one of the thing I hate about EA and their corperate practice but i am still young and I can wait and pray one day mroe red alert game will come out that continue it's legacy.Over all game play is quite short, 4 mission for soviets, and 3 mission for the other 3. There are also some skirmish missions but i will skip them for other games.8/10 for enjoyment of classic.			",2441,943,81,289,309,25,343

												As a longtime fan of RTS games in general, and particularly of Command and Conquer Generals, I give this game a rating of solid, or 6.5/10. I have now played C & C Generals, Tiberium Wars, and, of course, this game. It's a fairly solid game, but it has a few basic flaws. First, there's only three factions. Sure, that keeps it a bit easier to know the enemy, but still- only three factions. To make up for that, almost each and every individual unit has a special ability. This makes the game that much more interesting, but also makes it incredibly daunting for new players to get into the game. In addition, it won't run in a window, and as a streamer, that makes the game slightly less good. Finally, some mechanics seem to make the game really unbalanced, like the ability to abduct an enemy's vehicles at will with the magnetic thing. On the other hand, the game gets a solid ten in cool factor. The Americans have advanced cryogenic technology, the Japanese have amazing transforming robots, and the Russians have bears. Honestly, the bears are the best part of the game. I mean, you can load the bears in cars, fly them around in helicopters, and they're an amphibious unit, so the bears can swim across the ocean.Buy it for the bears. Absolutely.

												It's like a Red Alert game (so, middling strategy, hilarious cutscenes, crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥ except it's all recycled(?) from Red Alert 3 proper, has roughly 20? cutscenes total over 3 mini-campaigns (4 missions tops!) and a bizarre proto-DOTA mode where you're a nigh-invincible psychic asian schoolgirl.It's weird. This is  really ♥♥♥♥ing weird. And it's ALL SINGLE PLAYER. Not to mention that there's a kind of cool, kind of irritating ""Commander's Challenge"" mode where you can play with any faction at any time? But you have to  start unlocking units for each side by beating certain missions to steal the tech, and...This game was a huge experiment and maybe some of this sounds appealing to you, and if so, I wish you luck! But all of it appealed to, and then disappointed, me in execution. Especially CC mode, holy crap that thing could have been neater.			",2446,961,90,309,287,27,386

												If you are new to RTS games, it is recommended that you DO NOT start with this game. At least give the other Command & Conquer titles or Red Alert 3 a try before you take on this game - it's not entirely beginner friendly lol.Although this is definitely not the best RTS games among the Command & Conquer series (Command & Conquer: Generals FTW!) but it's still a pretty decent game overall. It's worth giving this game a try if you have played and enjoyed Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3 (RA3) and wouldn't mind finding out what happened after RA3. This Uprising expansion of the original RA3 continued the story of RA3 and also introduced a few new units. However, some new units turn out to be quite overpowering and can result in imbalanced gameplay, but that's okay since the offline campaign are pretty well-crafted and this expansion has no multiplayer anyway.Compared with the earlier RTS titles from the Command & Conquer series, the AI in this game is hella smart - better at expanding, sneakier attacks, more versatility at units selection, use of superpowers and greater capability at rebuilding in the event that their main base is destroyed. If the considerable difficulty in the campaign doesn't impress you and you are looking for some hardcore challenges, you can give the Commander's Challenge (CC) mode a try too! Some of the challenges featured in CC are pretty extreme yo. In the event that you are stuck at a challenge and couldn't progress, this awesome guide might help: http://thegameguru.me/2013/12/27/red-alert-3-uprising-challenges-guide/Good luck and have fun :)			",115,12,8,8,8,1,39

												SOLVED! Command & Conquer Red Alert 3 Uprising not launching/working on Windows 10. after soo long trying to figure out some way to get the game to run on Windows 10, I FINALLY found a solution just when I was messing around in the display driver settings. First of all my laptop is the late 2016 Razer Blade with the GTX 1060 and Core i7 6700HQ. Okay here's how I got it to work on Windows 10, first, make sure the game is not running as an administrator and all the compatibility mode/settings are disabled, I know most people probably enabled these trying to get the game to work (including myself). Okay next, open settings, in the search bar type ""device manager"" then select it, next select ""display adaptors"" then ""Intel HD Graphics"" then go to ""driver"" and select ""Roll Back Driver..."" then just give it a minute, the screen may turn blue for a second or whatnot, and that's it! the game should run perfectly! you can adjust it to whatever graphics or resolution you want and you can use a dedicated GPU (if you have one). if this helped you please like this comment so others will see! :)			",16,3,7,1,2,0,6

												Really good game, I grew up playing the C&C series and it was like my life support, I loved it. RA 3 was awesome but this was suprising to me come to think of it NO MULTIPLAYER is kinda sad so I wont recommend it to people who hates playing singleplayer games and I would recommend this to younger audiences that were newly introduced to Red Alert but I'm expecting that they'll have a hard time managing every single unit in the game, I know that many people got hooked to this game because of the trailer, come on everyone would want to see the might and laser beam of the Giga-Fortress shown in the trailer and the majestic sight of missiles from the dreadnoughts but please guys look for the game content and not visual effects and the cutscenes that give you the sense of being a real commander but we should look in the content of the game and not just the effects to have fun, if you're having fun of the game because of the visual effects then your only having like 40% fun but if you focus more on the storyline combined with the visuals then I can guarantee that you'll have the time of your life.

												Red Alert 3: Uprising is a singleplayer only, standalone expansion and if anyone thought that Red Alert was standing on a cliff, Uprising takes a running start and jumps off. The units are even more insane, the national stereotypes are even worse and the cleavage is off the charts.The map design however is probably the biggest flaw in this game. From the first map onwards you are treated to frustrating grind, self-contradicting mission objectives and maps that assumes you already knows everything about the original. The complete lack of any sort of a proper introduction or explanation to the units or the gameplay makes much of the game an exercise in trial and error and that's something that gets boring very fast.This is the end of Red Alert, it's not even simply mediocre anymore it's gone full blown crap. It's a bad game who's only redeeming factor is the amount of breasts you get treated to during the cutscenes, and that's not enough of a reason to buy a game.			",980,332,42,138,118,11,215

												A singleplayer only standalone addon to Red Alert 3, my favourite CnC game. Though the campaign lost its coop mode, it still has its charme. The big feature in this is the challange mode, which really got me for hours and still going on. Many really interesting mission, with restricted units and kinda smart commanders await you in it.The big downside is the completely missing multiplayer, i guess due to balancing issues with the new units.

												It doesn't have the polish or the finesse of RA3, but it has enough singleplayer content to keep you entertained for a long time.  The conquest mode or whatever is just a set of conditions on a skirmish.  However, the last few are some of the best challenges you're going to get out of a single player RTS.I still don't know what the hell they were thinking without multiplayer though.

												This was a interesting standalone. The pros are the new units, Yuriko campaign, and Commander's Challenge. The cons for this is that the campaign for each fraction is short and there is no mulitplayer, but probably for a good reason (Most new units are overpowered, especially the Giga Fortress). This standalone is just for solo playing, but overall it's quite fun to dominate with powerful units.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The only flaw is that it doesn't have multiplayer at all. Not even co-op.Probably because EA were lazy enought to balance the new units, so they made them super OP in the campaign missions.Oh well, the challenge missions will give you a real challenge though.			",52,3,1,5,0,0,8

												Fun for a short gaunt, but otherwise forgettable.  The Red Alert franchise has gone away from strategy and tried to make it actiony ... too many special powers, units have far too low health (so they easily die), and just the speed of it feels like you're playing an RTS of fast forward.

												8/10 from me.I really recommend this game to Red Alert fans. If you haven't played the previous Red Alert's and want to buy this game, I suggest play Red Alert 3 first. I was a fan of Command&Conquer games since like 2009, especially the Red Alert series. It's a relief to have this game after playing hundreds and hundreds of hours of Red Alert 3 with the same ol' s**t, where Kirov's, Twinbaldes, Mirage Tanks, Athena cannons and Shogun's can always win you the game. Now, with the Giga's and Harbingers the enemy can pretty much wreck you if you let them build some. Also the Challenge mode and the Yuriko story is really fun, though short. Sadly no multiplayer though.Overall, great addition to Red Alert 3. Although if you haven't played Red Alert 3 and wanna buy this game, you probably won't know what the f*ck's going on. :)			",35,6,0,1,9,0,4

												Wie beim Hauptspiel ist die Kampagne viel zu kurz, wenn auch schon etwas schwerer. Die neuen Einheiten sind ganz interessant, wenn auch teilweise etwas zu stark geworden aber ausbalanciert war ja auch schon das Hauptspiel nicht. Wirklich empfehlenswert ist ""Uprising"" eigentlich nur für Personen, die mehr von der Story erfahren wollen. Wenn es einem eher um den Multyplayer oder Solo-Gefechte geht dann tut es das normale ""Alarmstufe Rot 3"" allemal.			",79,33,3,22,16,1,33

												TLDR: Standalone Real Time Strategy game following the events of Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3. You don’t need the base game to play this, but in my opinion, you should probably play the base game before trying Uprising. 7/10If you’ve played any of the Command & Conquer (C&C) games, you should know that they’re a little bit silly in terms of overacting and racial stereotyping, but fun in their gameplay. The Red Alert series in particular is less about being realistic and more about having crazy units battling each other (Russian war bears, Japanese Samurai, Allied sonic attack dolphins). They also have a long standing tradition of full motion video cutscenes at the start of each mission starring a bunch of familiar faces. None of the actors are huge stars but you should definitely recognize a few. The women wear low cut tops and short skirts while the men are stereotypical badasses.*Spoilers for Red Alert games*The Red Alert series of C&C games takes place in an alternate history, created by a foolish time traveler who thought he was doing the world a favor by going back and taking out Adolf Hitler before he rose to power. Unfortunately, the time traveler never took into account that Joseph Stalin’s Soviet Union would rise to power in the mid-20th century, and without a powerful Nazi war machine to oppose them, the USSR rolled across Europe and Asia conquering everyone in their path. Instead of USSR + the Allies versus the Nazis, it became Allies versus USSR. In Red Alert 3 (the game right before Uprising), the Empire of the Rising Sun (Japan) came out of nowhere, challenging the Allies and the USSR with their super advanced technology. The Allies manage to barely come out on top, and Uprising takes place very soon after the victory.Red Alert 3 Uprising, like other Command & Conquer games is a Real Time Strategy game divided into 4 separate campaigns, 1 for each of the 3 factions and a fourth campaign which follows a single character as a pseudo RPG (like the Tassadar missions in Starcraft 1). Since Uprising is just sort of a standalone expansion, each campaign has only 4 missions. Be advised that the game is quite difficult (except the RPG campaign, which is kind of just for fun/story). Just like Supreme Commander Forged Alliance, you are tossed into the thick of it without any easy “learning missions.” If you’ve played any of the previous C&C games, the mechanics are very similar. Almost everything is done with your mouse “right click.” You may find that the resource gathering is a lot simpler in Uprising because the resources are in fixed locations. You don’t need to send your vulnerable ore harvesters out into the middle of nowhere gathering minerals. Pros:+The pre-mission cutscenes are enjoyable as always, with recognizable actors hamming it up on screen. +There is a lot of variety in gameplay, not just in the large number of different unit types, but also the occasional “commando” missions where you’re sneaking around behind enemy lines.  The money flows pretty freely in the game so you can afford a bunch of very powerful units, and every unit in the game has some sort of secondary/special ability. Every mission takes about an hour, so even though each campaign only has 4 missions, it takes about 12 hours to beat the game. Not bad for an expansion.Cons:-The game has no multiplayer, though it does have a skirmish mode where you can play vs the computer 1 on 1.-As mentioned above, the game is quite hard, and this really shouldn’t be the first Command & Conquer game you play. The difficulty might turn off new players.Overall the game is a lot of fun, and if you enjoy old school Real Time Strategy games, you should enjoy Uprising as well. If you have the other games in the series, play them in order. Unlike a lot of modern games with multiple campaigns, the campaign endings in the Red Alert series are mutually exclusive. If you win with the Russians, you conquer the world and Russia rules all. If you win with the Allies, the Russians are completely defeated, etc.  ",655,206,34,57,43,12,103

												I have enjoyed the classic Red Alert 1 and 2 before, and 3 hasn't let me down either. Graphics of the game has improved significantly compared to 2, and many units are beautifully and uniquely designed. I especially love building stuff in water!The controls remain largely the same, and the game stresses more on inter-unit collaborations than having one very powerful unit (maybe except the Giga Fortress). Plot is the usual, but I enjoy seeing that the characters have their own personalities. The only part of the game that I didn't really like is if you select a group of units and command to go to another place, they always end up being in formation with wide gaps between them. It isn't useful when the combined firepower of all units can only protect the integrity of your forces if they happen to be very close together.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a pretty nice standalone expansions, though I wouldn't recommend buying it on it's own as there's not much story in it, and the missionss might be pretty hard for a first timer. Also, no co-op.It's a pretty great purchase if you enjoyed Red Alert 3 and want more singleplayer content, though. The missions are actually challenging this time, even if there are few of them. The new units are pretty cool too, either filling the gaps (harassment mortar/molotov bike for soviets, anti-air archer for Empire) or are unstopable top tier super units like Gigafortress capable of switching between a destructive naval platform and a flying artillery, or a heavy support aircraft that doesn't need to rearm, ever.Anyways, feel free to buy it if you liked Red Alert 3, you should enjoy the new content. Even the less interesting additions like a Yuriko mini-campaign have some memorable moments.			",156,30,1,24,19,1,44

												The Command and Conquer series continues its modern rendition with a sequel to Command and Conquer: Red Alert 3 (C&C:RA3). Uprising is a direct followup to C&C: RA3 using the upgraded SAGE engine, but the game offers little in terms of the overall story arc of the Red Alert series. Uprising still offers a conclusion to the saga's story and an expanded army, but fails to stand on its own if you're not into series.			",339,109,2,23,21,4,34

												There are quite a few new units in this and a new story to each faction and as you can guess, it's under the assumption that the allies won, oh joy.Anyway, there are 4 campaigns to choose, allies, soviets, empire and yuriko which is a personal story about the special unit the empire have, Yuriko Omega. You have to play the soviets first though a mission or two to unlock the others and the only two stories I like in this one is the soviets and Yuriko's because I could understand why they want to do stuff, but the other two is merely a grab for power and such.Alll in all, nice new units, but the campaigns are a bit short so it's a okey buy and you don't need red alert 3 to run so maybe buy it when it's on sale like I did, I believe.

  Pros   Classic Single player War  RTS Game Nice Graphics. No Glitches. No Crashes.  Cons   No Multiplayer No Mods. Can't create custom game scenarios.   Verdict  If you love base building single player war RTS game. then this game is for you. Only it lacks replay value if you get tired of the usual game mode.			",66,8,0,26,5,0,15

												Horrible overall. Everything needs to be micro-managed, your units have ZERO level of intelligence. Enemy units will always use the best weapon against a unit, yours are just dumb and will use the weapon they currently have selected no matter what. This means that you have to constantly micro-manage every group of unit you have, you can't just have groups moving in place and trust them to defend themselves, they will just get decimated by one enemy unit that happens to have a weapon capable of destroying your units and will not even fight back. It takes a LOT of clicking/hotkeying to get your units to use the right weapon, and that weapon is probably useful against only a few of the enemy units you are currently encountering. Of course, if you don't tell them to attack the units to which their weapon actualy does damage, well, you're screwed, they will keep attacking other units inneffectively until they die. Micro-managing... Micro-managing... Micro-managing... Micro-managing... Micro-managing... AAAAAAAARGH.This game is very tedious to play, it feels like work, not a lot of fun to be had here. Stay away from it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Gets it all wrong. Terrible entry in the C&C series. Every movement is a fire drill. Every unit needs your tender care and constant attention. None of the effects of combat are intuitive and there are special abilities that exist for no other reason than to demand more actions per minute from you. The visuals are distracting, the audio cues misplaced, they even managed to produce boring music.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Wow, so there are very few titles in video game history that have fallen as far or as hard as Red Alert has and this title ""uprising"" has to represent something close to rock bottom. It is infathamable that EA allowed this to happen. Regardless of whatever personal feelings anyone might have in the mid 90s Westwood had outsold Doom and Warcraft 2 combined. ""Raking in the money"" doesn't even begin to cover it. By the 2000s Westwood had set the standard for macro based RTS games so high that almost everyone else in the genre just gave up or sold themselves over to strangled food cap or hero gimmickery, So what happened?EA bought them out. To stay competitive and release quality products Westwood needed more than one year of developement time per game and this concept flew over the heads of those wretched goons at EA. So despite being one of the most successful video game giants in the world they where chewed up and spat out. Having played uprising for all of fifteen minutes I have to ask myself. Was this game a legitamit attempt to make money or were they just spitting on the grave of the one billion dollar franchise they threw away? and  I wonder, did EA take their games off of Steam or did Steam kick them out? kudos either way.

												Having grown up with Age of Empires II, Age of Mythology, Age of Wonders, Starcraft, ect., this is probably the worst RTS I've ever played in my life.This game isn't fun, it's tedious and boring.The building system is stupid, it just forces you to be constantly waiting.Some carrier units let you choose where to deploy, others only let you deploy where they are, and it's just random which is which.You can own every single resource-producing structure on the map and still get pestered by INSUFFICIENT RESOURCES INSUFFICIENT RESOURCES INSUFFICIENT RESOURCES INSUFFICIENT RESOURCES INSUFFICIENT RESOURCES INSUFFICIENT RESOURCES INSUFFICIENT RESOURCES INSUFFICIENT RESOURCES.Here's the campaign:""God job capturing that thing, we're giving you two units to capture the next thing and you can't build buildings yet - hey here come 3 dozen enemy tanks to blow up the first thing you captured""""You have to protect these scientists and take them to the extraction zone.  Along the way are 26 enemy artillery units that kill anything in one hit.""""Great job, we're sending you reinforcements of our top secret experimental super powerfull absolute best units oops look at that they all got killed by that enemy strike force - hey use the last remaining one at half health to complete the objective.""If you're looking to have fun, look elsewhere.

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			",54,3,2,5,4,0,5

There is skirmish in this game as well. 8/10 for Story and gameplay, but not a 9 because it lacks of randomly generating map maker.			",276,24,5,43,18,2,34

												Can't recommend this one, sorry.It's still red alert with some new units, all units are OP compared to the old ones. You have two diffrent ways to play the game, a short campaign version (think it was 4 missions per faction) and a conquest-type gameplay. NO MULTIPLAYER (wtf?) and thats why i say no. Do not buy this unless you like to play singleplayer... even then i can't help to feel abit ripped off.			",228,42,16,26,55,1,50

												This is the worst entry in the C&C franchise yet. At least Renegade was fun in multiplayer.The jokes make are cringe-inducing. The FMVs don't have the home made earnestness that made the early games charming. The unit balance is non-existent. The game gives every single unit an ability that is annoying and unnecessarily effective. The missions are drawn out slug fests until you can deathball their static defenses. The pathfinding comes straight from 1999.It's like grandpa EA is elbowing you in the ribs, wanting you to notice that he gets the irony of the franchise and is trying to be edgy.

												I learned a lot by playing Command and Conquer: Red Alert 3 - Uprising.  I learned that strippers make the best commanders.  I learned that buildings are fireproof.  I learned that the best way to sneak into an enemy country is via tugboat.  I learned that the reason the Soviets lost the cold war is because their controls were so awful.C&CRA-U is one of those games that's trying to mask mediocre gameplay with eye candy and humor.  Both are miserable failures.  I'm sure having a stripper for a commander appeals to the 15-21 crowd, but it just made me cringe.  The humor is based around really bad Russian accents and national stereotypes.  no game in my list has been more painful to play.As for what really matters, the game play, it's just the same old RTS mechanics that we've been playing for 20 years now.  Order people around, shoot foreigners, maybe use a special ability, there's nothing new to see here.  In the grand tradition of the C&C series, all the cut scenes are live-action using real ""actors."", but really that stopped being novel in the 90s.  If you want to play an RTS, avoid this game and play something like StarCraft 2.  This is just another weak entry in a franchise that's been milked to death.			",295,80,5,71,40,3,70

												After enjoying many Red Alert Command & Conquer games and being ready for another chapeter, I purchased this game with my own money. I don't think I've regretted spending money on software so immensely since purchasing Windows XP 64 bit edition (and not being able to use it on my college's network).Some people will certainly enjoy this game, I just can't imagine how or why.

												This is a somewhat early review, which I will change later but I can't say that I am enjoying this remotely as much as the original Red Alert 3 which I put something like 300 hours into.This standalone feels somewhat too hard to get into, probably as an attempt to try and make the game seem longer. A lot of people here are talking about how the units are so overpowered, but to be honest I think it's the enemy units that are too overpowered. I'm not a super-veteran of RA3 but I do definitely know the ins and outs of the game. I feel like too many of the campaign missions in this game rely less on skill and more on avoiding fights outright to avoid getting annihilated or spam building 1 unit and then doing a crazy rush in order to try and take an objective right before losing your entire forces.I love the Red Alert series but this felt like a half-baked cash grab and I wasn't impressed that there's no multiplayer. For €2 though I guess I can't complain but I can't recommend the game either.			",43,8,0,9,0,0,13

												Wow... I owned the original RA3, and i could say that game was REALLY good, enjoyable but could get a bit easy and repetitive.After buying this expansion which BTW doesn't need the original RA3 installed to be played (you won't loose any content either way), it was a straight upgrade.Look, the campaign is pretty okay,Skirmish, on the other hand i kinda miss the fact that they replaced ""which commander"" each opponent is,and now you just play against literal bots, but other than that it's kinda funny how it's REALLY fun to play.Yet broken, which is why the loss of multiplayer, skirmish is a good ""time-smasher"" as i call, because with all the new units and whole load of maps, it gets really  Weird,Fun,Hard,Intense. .You should get it if you want extra RA3 action, assuming you already played the Vanilla RA3. Extra notes:   I found out that, they should have given the soviets something as ""OP"" as Harbinger or Giga Fortress.....Other than their sexy women, they're pretty much the more challenging faction to play as. No more notes for you!  Still reading? Wow....... seriously dude, STOP..  STOP LOOKING AT ME!  YOU'VE D00M3D US ALL! RUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN  ",41,2,0,1,2,0,4

												Why I bought the game: Had to, CNC fanWhat I liked about the game: It plays well, sort of Red alertish but in my opinion a bit faster paced. I actually enjoyed playing this game, I was not expecting much going into it. What I didn't like about the game: Allies soundtrack gets annoying, Super weapons and Special units seemm to be un balanced. Structures are made of paper seemingly.  Would I buy at current asking price of 9.99? It's on sale half off, you can probably get it in a package deal, I wouldn't reccomend paying for this one. **Disclaimer**I would like to state all changes made by the developers of the game after this review could potentially make this entire review irrelevant.

												For some reason, this game expansion gets a really bad rap on metacritic I believe because people wanted it to basically be Red Alert 4, with a whole bunch new SP and MP experiences. However, if all you want is more Red Alert 3 SP experience, then this is well worth it! It adds ~10 more hours of RA3 to your life. So, if you liked RA3 and want more, get this, if you only kind of liked RA3 don't get this, and if you haven't tried RA3 yet, do that first, then consider this.8.5/10			",247,19,1,32,28,1,77

												I really enjoyed Red Alert 2 and was craving  a good RTS, so I got excited when I remembered this was in my steam library. The excitement was very short lived - heres why. Poor OptimizationMy PC can run almost any game at 60 fps on the highest settings. In this game, I have to run it on medium just to get 45 fps. This was the first bump in the road, but I figured the gameplay would still be good. Oh how wrong I was...The CampaignThe campaign opens up with some cutscenes that, due to acting and set and some video editing, are comical in appearance - I believe this is intentional. The rest of the campaign is also comical - not intentionally. Let me make this clear: if you are looking for a real RTS, maybe coming from SupCom or another great game, this game is NOT for you. The campaign more closely resembles a point and click adventure than a real RTS game. Move from location A to B. Oh no, enemies, fall back and wait for reinforcements. Move to B. Move from B to C. Oh no, enemies, fall back and wait for reinforcements. Move to C. And on and on and on and on. NO effort WHATSOEVER put into developing a good campaign. BalanceHere's another point in which they made huge mistakes: superweapons. These add to the removal of need for strategy in a strategic genre. These weapons allow massive destruction, killing of units, bombing runs, etc etc, without need for Line of Sight, units in the area, or any other balancing factor. Basically, they all have a charge time and it becomes a time bomb. This forces you to throw troops into battle just as soon as they're made, or deal with the consequences when the enemy's super weapon comes online in 2 minutes. No time for planning, or an army, or strategy. Just go go go before you get hit by Russia's massive bomb or their magic vacuum that sucks your units up into space forever. Speaking of which, let's talk about Russia. If you play AS Russia, you win. If you play AGAINST Russia, you lose. Yup, that's all I have to say about Russia.ConclusionThey started out with a great game, but completely half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥the campaign and added some ""features"" that remove the need or the ability to use strategy in the game. If you are looking for a visually appealing game in which you get to watch two armies (but not really because you can't POSSIBLY build a force big enough to call an army without a super weapon wiping it out) constantly duke it out in small skirmishes, with the occasional dramatic wipeout of one, then this game is for you. If you are looking for a game focused on strategy, balance, and, well, basically an RTS game, this is NOT for you. Go find another game.			",70,6,3,1,8,0,2

												The original one is WAYS better.But anyways... about this crap they delivered here...Pro's:-A few new units (Some are rediculously OP and almost unbeatable, making the gameplay completely unbalanced)-Some new commanders-2 or 3 new maps-Challenge modeCon's:-Short campaigns (seriously...partly not even just short 5 missions each?)-Challenges are unfair as hell. (You struggle to build a base, needless to even just think of units, while the AI swarms you already with high tier units)-No more co-commanding (they still act like allies but you cannot order them anything)-Commanders only introduce themselves in missions (playing Skirmish is totally plain...)-Unbalanced gameplay thanks to the new units (Already mentioned that in the pro's, still wanted to also state it here)All in all... feels like an Add On you seriously don't need. The few units actually make the game worse and the feeling of playing Skirmish is ways to plain. If you have some cash to waste, get it while it is on sale, it isn't worth the full price... or even better, buy the normal one and if you already have it, buy it again to gift it. Just don't waste your time on this giant stinking pile of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t!			",86,11,3,3,17,2,23

												If you only like the campaign missions you may buy this game, but I wasn't impressed. But if you like to MULTIPLAYER this game, DONT BUY IT! I believe they thought that the multiplayer was unballanced and that was the reason they didn't put it in. Anyway, graphics/sounds are good, gameplay a little clumsy because every unit has a different firemode or ajdustment (dont like that, too much management).

												Before buying this game you have to ask yourself these questions:1) Are you a true C&C fan? This means you've loved it from C&C and Red Alert and played them all.2) Are you only jumping on the band wagon since it hit the Xbox? If so, are the new C&C games the only one's you have played?3) Have you ever played Red Alert 2 and Yuri's Revenge and liked them?If your answers are yes, no and sweet jebus yes! Then DO NOT touch either Red Alert 3 or Uprising with the longest pole imaginable.The game has been well and truely ruined. I ended up ordering Red Alert 2 off of Amazon because it really is the only good online Red Alert (Besides Yuri's Revenge, which needs original game anyway)			",83,5,0,2,7,1,25

												great expansion, poor delivery.This expansion added a bunch of nice new units to the three factions of red alert 3 which leveled the playing field for all comanders, aswell as making the vets to adapt and form new tactics. The base game of red alert 3 felt like it was missing something unit-wise, and this game definatly delivers for that aspect. This expansion also has a new rewarding challenege mode aswell as three new  mini campaign for all three factions as well as the japanese commando's campaign... so you learn how the OP cute little japanese schoolgirl got her powers :D.. So now to state the problem with this package........ NO MULTIPLAYER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I mean seriously EA? you spend alot of time making a great expansion for redalert and dont add multiplayer????????? We dont want to play only against AIs we want to go online and use these new units to wreak havoc online, but EA failed us once again. If you are dominantly a SOLO player i recommend you to pick this up, for that you'll have many hours of entertainment. but if you are a multiplayer/COOP kinda of guy/gal i would avoid this one.

												I have absolutely no idea why the new units in this game aren't in the regular Red Alert 3. This game has no internet gameplay, and with these units the sides would be much more balanced. The Supertank X-1 for the Allies, for example, isn't in the regular game and it's hard to manage against Japan's King Oni or Russia's Apocalypse Tank. It's still a good game, but the Ultimate Edition launched for the consoles would've been much better.			",44,5,1,4,3,0,7

												Great game, even through i have a pretty bad computer, it still runs this game smoothly, it's quite fun to play, and the Yuriko Omega campain is pretty fun to do on it's own, the challange is really addictive too, but get annoying when you don't know what stage you should do next. The other campains are a bit less, in my opinion, they fall short when you compare them with the campain from the extension of Red Alert 2. Too bad about the lack in multiplayer.

												Uprising is a single player expancion to RA3, if you're into SP instead of MP then this is the way to go since it's got alot of new maps and some cool and silly units. There's the regular campaign continuing the story to RA3 and of course the regular C&C's Skirmish mode. I have preordered every single C&C game to date (retail) including this one, and while it was a pretty awesome SP experience, I got little time in it compared to the rest of the series since I really am into C&C MP.

												For my Red Alert 3 review: go  here. Highly recommended to read it in order to understand what I'm talking in this review.To start it off, the campaign is shorter than Red Alert 3's, not featuring as many missions as the original game, but there are 4 campaigns now; aside from the normal Allies/Soviets/Empire you also get to play the story of Yuriko Omega, a story which plays pretty much like a MOBA match. For each mini-campaign there are only 3 missions, but make no mistake, missions are not easy, even with difficulty toned down.Most of the new units added are an interesting and useful addition, but there are a few which seemed pretty broken, as in pretty overpowered:Harbinger Gunship (Allies): These are the Mammoth Tanks of GDI from C&C 3, with two twin-engines strapped to them. They are able to switch between twin Collider cannons (same but smaller cannon as the Proton Collider superweapon) and an infantry-shredding auto-gun. What ticks me off about this airborne tank is that it has a huge HP pool (oh, it also self-repairs), it shatters everything on the ground, and you'd need quite a bit of anti-air to take them down. If you let your opponent make more than 3 of these and are not aware he's rushing to build them, you can just surrender immediately before you get roflstomped. It is indeed the most expensive unit of the Allies, but it's also very cost-efficient, and can go 1v1 against a sea-landed Giga Fortress.Grinder (Soviets): Although they fit the character of the faction, any ground forces facing these head-on is going to have a really bad time, because they are borderline impossible to beat without swarming them, and never from the front where the main melee weapon is. This is particularly an issue if you play as Allies because they're hard to escape from and are hard to retaliate against (as Allies you either swarm or use attacks from air). If you play Empire and don't field expensive ground units like King Onis, you're in the clear since you should always have Chopper VX's in your arsenal against these battleship-armor menaces. Oh yeah, these are also amphibious, but thankfully they can't grind your packed MCVs in water.Reaper (Soviets): These are the big bad older brothers of the Sickle. What is most annoying about them is that they are a carbon-copy of Empire's flexibility when placing defensive turrets, except these can shoot back at your units constantly. Their special ability permanently entrenches them and gives them a defensive bonus, not to mention they're both anti-surface and anti-air.Giga Fortress (Empire): Oh yeah, saved the best for the last. This sonofa♥♥♥♥♥♥ is THE most expensive unit in the entire game, but if you give the Empire player to make one or two of these, you're done for, might as well surrender before getting absolutely smashed. This unit dubs as a mobile sea fortress and a giant airborne head whose attack is also VERY long and pretty wide, doing two series of damage: when  it touches the unit and when the attack explodes a short while after. In its sea form it has 8 guns, faster-firing and more but shorter ranged version of the ones from the Shogun battleship, as well as an array of anti-air/anti-ground rockets. Be extremely wary of this if you play on a map with mini-lakes against a Empire player, because the airborne form has no anti-air capability, but once you give it the chance to get over water, the situation changes dramatically, firing back at your airborne attackers. Here is where those unit disablers (Hydrofoil with the ray gun, Rocket Angel with the para ray) are a must, and you must dish out the Harbinger Gunships/Kirvos against this, preferably when it's on the sea because in air you obviously can't hit it.Skirmish and multiplayer are covered in my Red Alert 3 review.

												All Red Alert games are great, I know that Red Alert 3 was a little dissapointing because reasons to some dedicated fans, I won't point out the specific reasons and I know that the currently the best Red Alert game is Red Alert 2 yada yada yada. Well about this Expansion, the two bad things they done is that this expansion isn't released as DLC (I can't believe that I'm saying this), the game is capped at 30fps and has no multiplayer.Still, It's enjoyable, new units, maps etc, same cheesy storyline like all red alert games and still the soviets and japanese are the ""bad guys"".

												Only difference between this and Red Alert 3, is that there are some new units you can use, it probably should have been an expansion but its still pretty good. The Low metascore probably mostly stems around its lack of having a multiplayer. (probably cause some of the new units are godly and there would be balance issues and all that. but the game is still fun nonetheless) .			",415,54,8,64,44,2,56

There's the regular campaign continuing the story to RA3 and of course the regular C&C's Skirmish mode. I have preordered every single C&C game to date (retail) including this one, and while it was a pretty awesome SP experience, I got little time in it compared to the rest of the series since I really am into C&C MP.

												Art is very good, the water is nice, effects are astonishing. But gameplay is mediocre at best. I don't remember which ones are the new units but units are really quick to die just like the standard RA3. So when you hear ""your unit is under attack"" sound, zoom at it, they die, as if i think it be ""your units decimated"" is more suitable. When i tought they balanced the game, they didn't. AI is really strong, the game has a good AI, so the AI units will quickly reatreat if they're outgunned, they will use the best unit to counter any unit, and they will use the best route to harras your undefended spot.Pathfinding sometimes stuck at some places, At some skirmish maps, there's another AI player which is off map that constantly bombard your base with special weapons which is not nice. The map zoom is horrible, as if you zoom out to far, you can't see your units and from the top screen will be gradually filled with black screen.What i don't like the most is the super weapons, they're not easily countered like CC generals. AI can nuke your base and units as if there's no fog of war with deadly accuracy, and you can't do the same with them because AI knows where you place your super weapon marking and start to scatter their unit(s) to the exact opposite direction if your super is the type that you can control. Early rush is the only the best Humane way to win the game.Game balance is bad. The former RA3 has already ton of imbalance problem, but this just worse. I'm not saying that i'm a good player, my APM is just 30 at best, and i'm not good with multitasking.The old units are not yet cured from being imbalance. I used to build only Sea Wings and they can do almost anything as long the map has water to build a shipyard. Or japanese VX walker, allied vindicator bomber, soviet twinblades for early rushes without real punishment. And then, giga fortress.			",5,2,0,9,3,0,6

												It's a bit disappointing there isn't multiplayer included in this expansion, but it makes a good single-player game. The campain adds some background to Yuriko, and the commander challenges are tough and fun.My favorite aspect of Uprising are the Commander Challenges. If you are an RTS vet you'll want to give them a try. They can be challenging and fun to play. The enemy commanders bring along some humor as well. If you're new to RTSs and RA3 you'll probably want to practice first, or play some of the RA3 and RA3U compains as they'll be difficult for new players and there are no difficulty settings. Having a good knowledge of the units and choosing how to attack is important in most of these missions, and in cases where there are more than one enemy managing the balance of power can be important to ensure one doesn't get too powerful, as you unlock units as you complete missions.

												I had played this game before I had a steam account, and beaten it 100%.  The campaign of this is rather short, but this game is just such an awesome rts game expansion of Red Alert 3 and challenge mode is amazingly attractive.  The idea that you beat a certain level to gain a unit which you can use to beat other levels kept attracting me back in.  I would beat unlock a bunch of levels but then use certain units to beat one level to unlock certain units to use to beat another level that I couldn't before, etc.  It's a ton of fun.  Even though the graphics are quite outdated now, the gameplay is still fun and I had a blast to the past plaing this game.  I would definitly recommend this game for any gamers interested in plaing RTS games.Rating: 8.7/10			",1009,366,27,101,102,10,123

												For my Red Alert 3 review: go  here. Highly recommended to read it in order to understand what I'm talking in this review.To start it off, the campaign is shorter than Red Alert 3's, not featuring as many missions as the original game, but there are 4 campaigns now; aside from the normal Allies/Soviets/Empire you also get to play the story of Yuriko Omega, a story which plays pretty much like a MOBA match. For each mini-campaign there are only 3 missions, but make no mistake, missions are not easy, even with difficulty toned down.Most of the new units added are an interesting and useful addition, but there are a few which seemed pretty broken, as in pretty overpowered:Harbinger Gunship (Allies): These are the Mammoth Tanks of GDI from C&C 3, with two twin-engines strapped to them. They are able to switch between twin Collider cannons (same but smaller cannon as the Proton Collider superweapon) and an infantry-shredding auto-gun. What ticks me off about this airborne tank is that it has a huge HP pool (oh, it also self-repairs), it shatters everything on the ground, and you'd need quite a bit of anti-air to take them down. If you let your opponent make more than 3 of these and are not aware he's rushing to build them, you can just surrender immediately before you get roflstomped. It is indeed the most expensive unit of the Allies, but it's also very cost-efficient, and can go 1v1 against a sea-landed Giga Fortress.Grinder (Soviets): Although they fit the character of the faction, any ground forces facing these head-on is going to have a really bad time, because they are borderline impossible to beat without swarming them, and never from the front where the main melee weapon is. This is particularly an issue if you play as Allies because they're hard to escape from and are hard to retaliate against (as Allies you either swarm or use attacks from air). If you play Empire and don't field expensive ground units like King Onis, you're in the clear since you should always have Chopper VX's in your arsenal against these battleship-armor menaces. Oh yeah, these are also amphibious, but thankfully they can't grind your packed MCVs in water.Reaper (Soviets): These are the big bad older brothers of the Sickle. What is most annoying about them is that they are a carbon-copy of Empire's flexibility when placing defensive turrets, except these can shoot back at your units constantly. Their special ability permanently entrenches them and gives them a defensive bonus, not to mention they're both anti-surface and anti-air.Giga Fortress (Empire): Oh yeah, saved the best for the last. This sonofa♥♥♥♥♥♥ is THE most expensive unit in the entire game, but if you give the Empire player to make one or two of these, you're done for, might as well surrender before getting absolutely smashed. This unit dubs as a mobile sea fortress and a giant airborne head whose attack is also VERY long and pretty wide, doing two series of damage: when  it touches the unit and when the attack explodes a short while after. In its sea form it has 8 guns, faster-firing and more but shorter ranged version of the ones from the Shogun battleship, as well as an array of anti-air/anti-ground rockets. Be extremely wary of this if you play on a map with mini-lakes against a Empire player, because the airborne form has no anti-air capability, but once you give it the chance to get over water, the situation changes dramatically, firing back at your airborne attackers. Here is where those unit disablers (Hydrofoil with the ray gun, Rocket Angel with the para ray) are a must, and you must dish out the Harbinger Gunships/Kirvos against this, preferably when it's on the sea because in air you obviously can't hit it.Skirmish and multiplayer are covered in my Red Alert 3 review.

												Good Game not as better as Red Alert 2 Yuri's Revenge & here's my reason it had more choses on the side like allieance side you had america britin france etc. & the sovit side you had russia cuba etc. & yuri just had his own army i still have to try the campain but im sure ill enjoy just like most C&C games ill give this a 7/10 & thats beause of the lack of choice options ill still give the oringle RA3 a chance & i might give this game a higher review or a serprate review when i beat the campain ill would suggest you guys pick this game up if you new to the C&C series yes it locks at 30fps but really it one of those games where 60fps or higher wont make much of a differeance so for the people giving a thumbs down because it locks at 30fps its not a big deal atleast it runs theres some games that will run a 60fps like BO3 & that framerate goes to 10 fps or worse at times im so dissapointed in BO3 but i do enjoy the zombies when its working. p.s. this game was made in 2008 xbox one ps4 or wii u wasent even out that year & 30fps around that time was like amazing after saying all that i know its a old game & its not really all that releavent anymore also srry i typed so much i didnt plan on typing so much for this review			",16,0,0,3,0,0,2

If they lowered the price it'd probably be about a 9-9.5/10 depending on how much they lowered it. Good game, but could very well be improved. Also some of the levels are kind of more difficult and rage inducing than you'd expect/want.			",26,2,0,2,1,0,1

												I've always been a fan of C&C Red Alert series (I do also like other C&C franchises) and this game is a decent addition to the Red Alert 3 background/epilogue story... but that's the problem. This is just a small addtion, too insignificant to be selling it separately at all. It doesn't bring much to the table other than the storyline and some unique units. In fact, it doesn't even have any network play features! If you have played Red Alert 2, you might remember an add-on called Yuri's Revenge and what it brought to the game. It had new units, countries, and maps, fully designed for online-multiplayer matches.Conclusion: This should've been released as a minor DLC while the developers worked on a proper expansion to RA3.My score: 4/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Only difference between this and Red Alert 3, is that there are some new units you can use, it probably should have been an expansion but its still pretty good. The Low metascore probably mostly stems around its lack of having a multiplayer. (probably cause some of the new units are godly and there would be balance issues and all that. but the game is still fun nonetheless) .			",415,54,8,64,44,2,56

												Red Alert 3 Uprising is one of those games you either love or hate. I for one love it, and let me tell you exactly why.Let's get this out of the way first; this stand alone expansion has no multiplayer component. None. Not even coop. There are some unit in this game that upset the balance to such a degree that it would be unethical to let anyone play against one another. If you can get over this, then you'll like the game. If you really need this mulitplayer thing, then you might want to pass.With that out of the way, let me describe Uprising for you. Uprising is an exercise in scenario building. It tries to create the coolest kinds of single player levels seen in RTS ever with ridiculous units and abilities that make a game of Warcraft seem tame. Image transforming tanks, ice beams, rockets everywhere, robots, tanks that eat buildings and giant floating heads with death rays that make any unit or building completely worthless. It does not end there. Each civ gets a few new units. The allies get to parade their new giant gunship and otherworldly tanks, as well as freeze troopers. The soviets have to do with a complete hack of an infantry killer, and some fast mechs. No, for the really cool stuff you need to check with the empire, who come rolling onto the scene with laser archers, robots with swords and the aforementioned flying death ray. Plenty of cool stuff to go around and no stupid balance that is holding any of it back. The game features three gamemodes. The campaigns, that come with some really impressive production value. General skirmishes. Finally, the commanders challenge. Where you have to overcome extremely strong AI opponents with limited units. Each victory gives you access to new units to use in your conquest. It is extremely hard, and fiendishly challenging, but funny and rewarding. I can reccomend this expansion. It's a blast while it lasts, and it provides some of that cartoonish fun that you don't get in any of the newer RTS games. If this is on sale, just shell those two bucks and indulge in some robot vs tank tomfoolery. You know you want to.			",192,21,8,22,19,2,33

												Presentation 9.5How do you top the Hoff? Add the Nature Boy Ric Flair, of course. The live action cutscenes remain top-notch, and the production values remain strong.Graphics 8.5Things are just as bright and saturated as ever; Uprising has a nice aesthetic appeal to it.Sound 8The soundtrack is still fun, and the audio is solid, but it doesn't quite stand out like before.Gameplay 8Uprising is about having fun blowing stuff up, and it is when it lets you. The puzzle-portions of missions are a bit tedious, though.Lasting Appeal 7.5There's no multiplayer or co-op play, but the Commander's Challenge will test your ability to fight and win quickly against the odds.

												One nice singleplayer story for Red Alert 3 with more challenging missions and a bonus moba like gameplay with Yurika secret weapon girl. Well its really fun but a bit short. It's hardly worth money you pay for it. But if you are a big fan of the series. It's worth it! (sorry for bad english)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												i absolutely love this game. i actually like this game to the level i love when i get hungry jaw. that is when you feel hungry in your gums after either tasting a tiny bit of food, knowing what the food you are going to have tastes like without having it and dying of anticipation before that sweet goodness hits your flaccid tongue, and hungry jaw itself is essentially a weak pulsating with a centralised location, usually top right side of your mouth (from memory) now that you know what hungry jaw is i can say that this game = hungry jawi have played this game for hours on end (maybe 15 minutes total) and i played as a little woman who ran around and destroyed everything easily.as much enjoyment as being constipated, and no its not a secret fetish of mineCONS - no shooty catPROS - id probably rather play this game than have my genitals run over by a carout of 100 i give it 48 - i tease it that it didnt pass.

												Clunky, unintuitive, and ultimately frustratingly disconnected from the heart of the genre. Unit pathing is rage inducing and the tactics are non-existant...just throw units at the enemy and hope for the best is the only viable strategy. Avoid this game if you actually enjoyed previous CNC games, it will only leave you disappointed.			",122,9,2,17,20,0,31

												While Uprising is not as good as Red Alert 3 itself, it has its moments. You don't get the kind of satisfaction that RA2 and RA3 had at the end of their campaigns, but the missions are still decently interesting and you can tackle them in a variety of ways (Red Alert has always been good at letting you tinker with ways to cheese its mechanics)As fun as Yuriko is to play in her campaign, I would have wished for more content surrounding her (with actual base building)Only play this if you want more of RA3, but then it's worth the little money it costs.

												Red Alert 3 Uprising is one of those games you either love or hate. I for one love it, and let me tell you exactly why.Let's get this out of the way first; this stand alone expansion has no multiplayer component. None. Not even coop. There are some unit in this game that upset the balance to such a degree that it would be unethical to let anyone play against one another. If you can get over this, then you'll like the game. If you really need this mulitplayer thing, then you might want to pass.With that out of the way, let me describe Uprising for you. Uprising is an exercise in scenario building. It tries to create the coolest kinds of single player levels seen in RTS ever with ridiculous units and abilities that make a game of Warcraft seem tame. Image transforming tanks, ice beams, rockets everywhere, robots, tanks that eat buildings and giant floating heads with death rays that make any unit or building completely worthless. It does not end there. Each civ gets a few new units. The allies get to parade their new giant gunship and otherworldly tanks, as well as freeze troopers. The soviets have to do with a complete hack of an infantry killer, and some fast mechs. No, for the really cool stuff you need to check with the empire, who come rolling onto the scene with laser archers, robots with swords and the aforementioned flying death ray. Plenty of cool stuff to go around and no stupid balance that is holding any of it back. The game features three gamemodes. The campaigns, that come with some really impressive production value. General skirmishes. Finally, the commanders challenge. Where you have to overcome extremely strong AI opponents with limited units. Each victory gives you access to new units to use in your conquest. It is extremely hard, and fiendishly challenging, but funny and rewarding. I can reccomend this expansion. It's a blast while it lasts, and it provides some of that cartoonish fun that you don't get in any of the newer RTS games. If this is on sale, just shell those two bucks and indulge in some robot vs tank tomfoolery. You know you want to.			",192,21,8,22,19,2,33
