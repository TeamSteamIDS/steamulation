												Always enjoyed this game, ever since I purchased a box copy of it back when it first launched in 2008.Been without 3D Acceleration for quite a while, since converting to Windows 10. The good news is that there's a fix in the Steam discussions within the Hub, and it works well.			",80,5,1,3,12,2,9

												A very colorful and highly detailed game, surprisingly for the latest computers. The game is fun, as it brings a childhood classic back to life, atleast with a new video card for me to be able to play it in a higher definition and in a much more clear picture. Complicated at the start, but once you get the jist of it, you become wanting to attempt at beating the game, finishing it, and the only way to do that, is to finish the complicatingly hard challenges that they have, and level up to the highest. In a few months of playing, atleast you can screenshot it for how well it is.			",177,32,1,24,20,3,18

												Definitely one of the best games I have ever played, HANDS DOWN.I am an avid gamer, a gamer who plays all kinds of video games to get different feelings and emotions for them. And nothing had compared, to the feelings I began to feel when I first played Bejeweled Twist.I have played games such as Skyrim, Call of Duty Ghosts, Battlefield 4, and they are all ok I guess. But this is the first game I have ever felt romantically involved with. I get home from a late day of work, working minimum wage, with nothing to do except for wallowing in my self pity and hatred. But when I feel sad and like I could die, Bejeweled Twist has always been there for me. Every gem I twist I feel a flame of confidence and happiness build up inside of me. As the multiplier builds up, so does my heart. And every round I pass, I feel like I could dance for hours. The bomb gems make the game scary at points, but it gives us a great life reminder. That although life has happy points, eventually life will run out of chances, and everything will end. Just like Bejeweled Twist when I trigger a bomb gem. Overall this game is a 10/10, and not just a game, but a best friend. Buy this game today, and if your life is feeling rough, once you start twisting those gems and exploding lightning gems your heart will scream with delight and your body will dance with euphoria.

												Bejeweled as a series is mostly about updating the graphics- Bejeweled, Bejeweled 2 and Bejeweled 3 are more or less the same Match3 game with tiny tweaks and prettier gems. Bejeewled Twist is the only game in the series that breaks some new ground, and it's well worth checking out.On an 8x8 grid, you match gems by twisting a group of four, clockwise, so that three or more like-coloured gems line up. Those gems are removed, new gems drop into the grid, you score some points, and that's the basic premise. It doesn't get much simpler- everyone can pick up Bejeweled Twist and play a little.Unlike classic Bejeweled, the game ensures that at each time, you have at least one possible move on your board. That's a generous gesture if you remember classic Bejeweled where running out of moves was an instant game over. But just because you always CAN make a move doesn't mean each game is endless. Par for the course you fill up a ""progress meter"" to advance in levels, and as you advance, all sorts of assorted nasty stuff is added. Locks make it impossible to move gems, and as they start to fill your grid your control over the board is heavily impacted. Bomb gems detonate after a couple of turns- you need to match them so they disappear. Should they trigger you get an increasingly smaller chance to still defuse them, but that's mostly based on Lady Luck and we all know you can't trust her. Simply put, the further you get the harder it gets to keep moving on.A couple of neat mechanics improve your score. Each time you make a match a small counter goes up, eventually increasing a score multiplier. Max it out to 10 and you get a chance to trigger the insanely awesome, over the top Fruit Bonus (dancing fruit gems, anyone?). From Lvl 2 onwards, you get a Bonus Sequence of colours to match, filling up the multipliers a little faster. And just like the classic Bejeweled games you get to make matches of 4, 5 and 6 gems to create flame, lightning and hypergems, all of which are designed to clear up the grid more easily.In terms of game modes Twist is a bit sparse. You get the classic mode where you try to surpass your highscore and a danger-free ""relaxed game"", which is the same without any nasty bomb stuff. There's also a timed mode, challenging you to get a high score in 2 minutes, which tends to run out of challenge quickly: There's only so much you can do with the mechanics and sooner than later you will have ""maxed out"" your score. A bit more interesting is the challenge mode, where a couple of different tasks in increasingly harder variants are available: This really is an interesting bonus and you may find some rulesheet there that really tickles your fancy.But ultimately, the meat of the game is classic mode. Without time limit, with always calculated risk and a wide variety of  valid tactivs this really IS the ""Twist"" game, and for the moderate price, any fan of Match3 should give it a try.

												It's only okay compared to the other Bejeweled games. The ""twisting"" aspect is interesting, but ultimately leaves me frustrated with the other aspects of the game, like the score multipliers and whatever else, because you lose your multipliers if you don't make matches in one move. Say you're out of moves, and you have to make three moves to make a match. Well, you'll be down from 6x to 4x in a hurry.			",110,24,9,14,9,1,8

												This is one of the best games to just sit back and relax with when you can't decide what to play.Vibrant colors everywhere and a great soundtrack pumping in your ears.  The gameplay is fun, and fairly unique for a jewel-crushing game.  Zen mode is just the best, and the challenge mode will bend your brain when you're ready for something harder.

												This game is so fun! Twisting the gems into place instead of just dropping them requires a bit more thinking about placement. Especially when you've got bombs ticking down, and locks that create roadblocks, all while trying to get the combos just right for maximum bonus points.  Also it's really nice to be able to switch between challenge mode and zen mode, so you can play when you want something more intense, and also when you want something to relax to.  I've always liked the Bejeweled games but I've never wanted to actually buy one until this game.  I like the upbeat music.  I'm not a fan of the somewhat creepy booming voice that tells you how well you're doing, but it's in all the Bejeweled games and not specific to this one. People that play the other games probably won't mind it, and it's a tiny complaint compared to how much fun it is to play.			",6,20,0,6,3,0,3

												Bejeweled is a classic game that never stops making you come back for more. Each Bejeweled is practically the same and delivers the same amount of fun in each. The goal of the game is to switch around a certain amount of jewels to put together a series of 3 or more in a line to make that line or set disappear. The graphics are perfect for the game. The sounds in the game can feel repetitive at times. The overall gameplay of the game is awesome and really burns some time for when you have time to spare. There are endless stages it feels like. Each level of the bejeweled series has its own tricks and treats for you to enjoy. I highly recommend playing these and getting any of these great Bejeweled games when you have a chance. I love playing them and these are highly recommended for anyone working in the office or at home. I love this series and i know you will too!!			",3039,1134,139,314,429,33,477

												There's something so satisfying when I twist these pretty gems and watch them explode. The obvious secret to getting the big points is to have consecutive matches, and also to take advantage of the bonuses. My high score in Classic Mode is 1,489,570. In Zen mode I'm at level 51, but that doesn't mean anything, because you can't lose in that mode. (is it ok to brag while reviewing a game? I have no idea) and it's a fun challenge trying to beat my best score. A few of my friends think this game is silly, but they seem to not be able to get their head around the simplicity of the twisting manipulation. The people who get this game are usually able to see 3 or 4 steps ahead, and those are the folks that usually have fun with this game. (That's not a rule, just something I've noticed)Sound effect, which mostly consist of incresingly intense explosions, are a blast. Dumb pun, but I had to do it.When I look at my hours played, it makes me think I may need Bejeweled Twist Rehab. Get myself a BT 30 chip. Or maybe just switch addictions.			",58,4,4,2,13,1,6

												Another version of the famous and much played Bejeweled series. Connect rows of coloured gems to raise your high score. While the previous games connect diagonally and vertically, this version twists the gems 90 degrees to the right, bringing a whole new dimension to the game. Keep connecting the lines and increase your bonus and you might even get to see the dancing fruit! :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A sequel to Bejeweled Deluxe 2, with slightly better cinematics/graphics but worse sound effects.Instead of swapping two jewels, you rotate (or Twist) a square of four jewels to match up three of a kind.The jewels do not return to their original position if no match was made this time, so you can rotate as many as long as you want to help benefit you.The game also highlights a match when you hover over a square of four that requires a rotate which makes the game almost too easy.Matching four in a row still spawns an exploding jewel to benefit scores.Random bomb jewels spawn with a timer that need to be matched/eliminated or else it takes points and jewels away.Rocks also get in the play board that can only be taken out by exploding bonus jewels so planning your moves is crucial.A nice different way to play Bejeweled!6/10 ",774,159,33,63,61,3,97
