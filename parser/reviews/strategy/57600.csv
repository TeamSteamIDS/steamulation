												Tropico 3 is a surprisingly good city builder or rather a 3rd world simulator. It is very different than games like Sim City and Cities XL. Those two games are more macro city builders, where in two or three mouse clicks you can make city blocks where 1,000 people might live. With Tropico and the Tropico series in general, you need to place each building, each road and your island along with the time it takes your construction company to build it. Your entire island might get to be 200 - 500 'Tropicans.'Each Tropican has needs... Food, religion, job, healthcare, entertainment, safety and so on. The catch is every Tropican's needs have a certain weight to them based on what political party / faction they believe in. Each faction has major and minor demands. The military will want more soldiers, so you need to build an army base. The religious faction will want a church or cathedral. The capitalist party will want privatization or upscale entertainment. The communist party will want you to enable the free public housing edict or have adequate healthcare.On top of that, you balance political relations with the USA and USSR. If they get too bad, one of the two will basically take over your country and it will be game over. It is interesting how many ways that you can get game over. The most common way to get a game over is to lose an election. You don't have to have elections even. You're in charge. If you don't want an election, the nationalist party will hate you and your loyalist party will love you. If you opt to have elections, it will be vise versca. People will call for early elections and when you have elections, you can see preliminary results and you can even sway (cheat) elections. Its all at the risk of a party's love.It is pretty cool having to pick 3 things to make a speech about and then fulfill campaign promises, but its all pretty easy. Winning elections is pretty easy, especially compared to how difficult it was to win any elections in the original Tropico. It was so bad in that game, that it was almost impossible to win an election without stuffing the ballot box.When citizens hate you, and there will be plenty that do, they will either peacefully protest or become rebels. Once you have enough rebels against you, they will attack your most remote buildings. Your army will then go fight them, but if the rebels outnumber your army, the rebel will win and the buildings will be destroyed. The rebels can attack your palace or flat out assassinate you for a game over.Tropico has a single player campaign with a lot of scenarios. You don't just pick scenarios, you unlock them. Each scenario seems to have scenario specific events that only occur in the scenarios. Some scenarios last 30 minutes, others a few hours as you take an island from 1950 - 1990 or so. At the start of each scenario you can pick a player character from historical tropican dictators or make your own avatar. You can even make personality traits that will result in pros and cons. It can drastically change your play style if you are incorruptible and never have any crime or have a green thumb and have high farm yields at the cost of low factory production.Your businesses, mines, farms, and everything requires citizens in them to function and make you money. Every citizen has different education levels that will impact who does what. So you need to build high schools and colleges. Once built, there are options to gear students to military or religion. You can also click vacant positions to hire foreign experts for a price. If you have more businesses than citizens, build an immigration office and let anyone into the country or change it to only let in skilled workers so you keep bums out of your country.Nothing is done automatically. You place a building, then wait for your teamsters and construction crews to build it. The more crews and personnel you have working, the faster it'll get done. I'm happy with that. Its part of the realism. If there's a building you want developed faster, you can increase or decrease its priority. If its still taking too long, just have your avatar stand next to the building to get it done faster.The graphics are beautiful and you'll see every Tropican walking around, hopping in their car and driving to locations. The music is nice and very Tropican / Salsa music. The radio DJ and the rebel DJ will provide a lot of flavor to what you're doing. The rebel DJ will always heckle you and every line is said with tongue in cheek humor. The game knows you're all powerful and while being a dictator is usually seen as a horrifyingly negative thing, the humor twists it into a silly positive thing.The only letdown is the fact there are no Steam achievements, yet it is the Steam Special Edition.

												I recommend Tropico 3 for many reasons:1. The aim of the game is to rule, and to rule for many years. You have work hard to do just that, managing the economy, maintaining your popularity, evading coups, balancing the factions on the island are a few examples. I enjoyed having to deal with all these.2. The graphics are nice, I haven't played the earlier versions of the game (the original Tropico or Tropico 2) but this one has nice buildings and landmarks to choose from. The user interface is also well designed (unlike Tropico 4 - see below).3. The game gives you an objective for each scenario, and you have only so many years to complete that objective. Having a single objective gives you a lot of freedom, you get to decide about other matters on the island.4. The game has really good music, the tracks certainly fit the 'Tropical' atmosphere.5. There is a plethora of different scenarios. Although it gets repetitive as you play, the game still has a good replay level.Comparing Tropico 3 & 4:So, if you are new to the Tropico series (like I once was), I would recommend getting Tropico 3 instead of Tropico 4. In my opinion, it definitely has a better user interface, a nicer objective system (Tropico 4 keeps giving you objectives - it is, as far as I have seen, endless and boring) and better music. One thing Tropico 3 may be lacking is imports (you can only export goods in T3), which is included in T4, but other than that, T4 is no better than T3, and I think T3 outweighs T4.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The first time I bought Tropico I was looking for something different. Tired of the same old shoot-em-up stuff. Tropico had just come on the market and looked interesting. I was supprised at how much fun it was. i found it very addictive and ended up spending a lot of time in it. I tryed Tropico Pirate's cove but couldn't get into it. I saw that Tropico 3 had gone back to more the way it was and I wanted to play it again so I bought it. I am not sorry I did. There are some things I don't care as much for but overall I think it is a great game. I would recomend this to anyone.			",32,27,2,16,42,0,9

												Sandbox is a blast once you understand how to run a great economy. Fun to increase the chance of revolution just to watch your lil police officers fight some rebegls.It's fun running your own island exporting and importing, making it a tourist attraction, and supplying your people with education. If that's your kind of game then get this :PCustomazation for your lil character isnt huge but it's okay.			",72,10,0,10,11,1,2

												The Absolute Power expansion is simply a must if you happen to ever play Tropico 3. Without it, the game is almost literally an HD remake of the first Tropico, which came out in 2001. The store page summarizes the additions, but basically it adds more of most everything: key additions being an entire new suite of great (if utterly gonzo) scenarios, a new faction, some new buildings and a whole new category of edicts.The only problem is that the DLC integration with the base game is weird, probably because it came out around a time when Steam was just starting to offer DLC for games. This means that if you buy the Gold Edition pack you can't actually play the base game by itself; you must play Absolute Power. It doesn't even give you playtime for the base game, which is troublesome if you want to leave a Steam review...but there's still a way to do that if you're resourceful.Other than that, if you own Tropico 3 but not Absolute Power, you should probably fix that if you're interested enough in the game to do so and if it's on sale.

												It is by far the best Tropico I have ever played.Relaxed gameplay, nice soundtrack, good graphics, funny sarcasm.Tropico III learned what was good and what was bad from Tropico & Tropico II, and Tropico IV was just a mere copy of this game.My one and only complaint: once you've learned how to manage your business, everything seems easier.It doesn't mean you won't play it anymore. As you can see by my playtime, I really enjoyed playing different maps and characters.Buy this game and enjoy your dictatorship.			",125,14,1,18,38,1,46

												I was reluctant to try the 3rd game in the Tropic series given Kalypso media's penchant for producing low-quality games IMO. But I was really surprised given the depth of detail for this series. Overall I can confidently say this is an improvement over the previous two games. The graphics aren't bad but what sets the game apart is the level of detail, from the radio, to the election speechs. I've only played it for several hours but so far I am impressed and eager to play more. The only  gripe I have is the camera movement, which at times can be irritating.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love this game. It's great fun, the campaign scenarios are creative, it has hilarious social commentary, there are different ways to approach each scenario and it satisfies my desire for games where I get to be an enormous♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I love campaign mode, I love sandbox mode.I do have a couple of tiny niggles:-Occasionally the basic starting buildings (especially garages) are placed such that they don't hook up with the road and it's actually impossible to fix it without demolishing them or the nearest section of road.-The crap the female avatars say is annoying. They've recorded one set of phrases for all male avatars and one for all females (which is.... twentyish versus about three, I think), fair enough. But no matter what kind of character I'm playing she says crud like ""My people love me because I am SO BEAUTIFUL"" and ""You are late! Come here and do my manicure!"" Hello, I'm playing an evil dictator, not just some random self-centered bimbo. Everything else they wrote was creative and hilarious (including every single thing that comes out of Betty Boom's mouth) they couldn't put a bit more imagination into what a female Presidente might say? ANYWAY.-There are achievements in-game, but not on Steam? I'm assuming that this is because I'm playing through the Classic campaign, so the achievements might be linked to an earlier Tropico release. Poo. I am an achievement hunter and I am saddened.These are really pretty tiny niggles, though, the kind of things I only notice because I like the game and play it a lot.			",50,24,0,24,34,0,19

												So. What is Tropico? Put simply it's a city builder crossed with The Sims set on remote islands where you are placed in the shoes of a satirical Castro type dictator. For those familiar with the series I'd like to point out that players complained about the move to dlc for every little thing in version 4 and the new 5 seems set to continue in that direction. T3 and the Absolute Power expansion were the first attempts of  Haemimont Games to recreate and update the original (T2 much loved by many was a bit of a departure using a completely different 'pirate' setting). By all accounts there have been no major changes to the series since V3 to this date (until 5 catches up with all it's dlc or a complete pack). Therefore, this is probably your best bet in terms of bang per buck at present. The humour is great, the game itself is highly addictive and absorbing, and there are plenty of scenarios here to keep you going for hundreds of hours. More importantly you can get this (along with T1 T2 T3, the excellent Inquisitor and a few other games) in the Reboot 4.00 bundle on BundleStars for an absolute pittance. I got that bundle in the first 24 hours for a ridiculous £1.50. It is now around the £3 mark and is easilly the best buy I've made in YEARS. For Tropico itself I'm giving 79%. For the bundle it's 100%. No-brainer.			",306,164,8,109,35,6,70

However, Tropico 2 and even Tropico 3 refuses to run in a window. I can't possibly recommend this with such a standard feature in PC games missing.			",1058,444,27,141,122,11,204

												Tropico is an amazingly detailed, yet definitely not chaotic game in which you rule as a dictator of an island. How you reign is not predeterminated at all. You can be a ruthless, people-shooting maniac with more soldiers than pesos, you can be a charismatic, nature-protecting communist, you can be a reckless, money-amassing capitalist who exploits his island for all the resources it has and so on and so on.the game constantly has a slightly funny, sarcastic tone, which sometimes even makes you laugh. everything looks cute and nice, but in reality tropico is a really good simulator for politics, economy and social demands. for fans of any strategy games, especially Sim City, very much recommended.

The economic portion of the game is well designed and it can be quite challenging at times to juggle the profitability of the nation with the wants of your citizens... or the militarization to suppress the rebels if you decide not to care about their happiness.

												Great fun to start with, but if there's oil or metal on your island then the entire mission becomes pretty pointless. As soon as you export weapons and oil your money goes through the roof and everyone get nice food and a villa. Also, with larger towns/cities I found that the game started to lag and stutter a little bit and then even struggle with empty islands until I rebooted the game - but I'm not running a high end machine so it could just be that. Definitely worth the money though and fun to drop back in to.			",27,3,0,2,6,0,16

												This game is amazing fun and is good for many hours of entertainment. As somebody who keeps trying to play city builders and constantly fails, this was a good change of pace as it is easily accessible to anybody at any level.  Pros:First of all, this game has great humor to it. Between the overt political humor, the banter of Juanito and Betty Boom on the radio, and various other in game jokes, it's almost certain to get some laughs out of you. Second, this game is exceptionally forgiving. While most city builders start to become babysitting jobs as the city becomes larger and complex, Tropico honestly doesn't have that many serious crises. Debt, unemployment, rebel activity, and random world event are all easily dealt with and do not require a lot of micromanagement. It honestly feels as if you are able to mostly just build and forget. Third, the political system within the game is an enjoyable part of running Tropico. I believe that there are seven or eight various political parties with various demands that have to be met. Failing to meet these demands can result in huge penalties (such as the militarists attempting a coup) and can cost you votes during election times. Yes you may essentially be dictator, but you do have the choice of allowing elects. Holding an election and handily winning an election by a huge margin is extremely fulfilling. Cons:After a couple of hours of playing you will notice that the game's soundtrack gets old and that eventually the radio djs become rather annoying. You'll also notice that eventually the building choices start to become exceptionally old. I can't remember how many times I made huge neighborhoods full of apartment blocks or relied on the same resources for my economy. Buying the Absolute Power DLC helps open up new choices, but it really doesn't add that many buildings that you'll find to be useful (with the windmill and the balloon ride being exceptions). Overall, buy this if you love building cities and may not have the most patience for more complex games like Sim City or Cities XL that require large amounts of micromanagement. 8.5/10 ",34,8,0,8,8,1,20

												This game is fun. Though not for the serious gamer it's a bit comical at times and deliberately bigoted in places for a quick laugh. I loved the options menus for choosing islands and settings. You knew exactly what to expect and had complete freedom to modify even the slightest details. The character skins were lacking but in game you almost never use el presidente so it's easily forgiven. The game could allow for longer play since I was only able to reach year 2115 before it would hard lock constantly. The pacing was good a little hard at times it felt like I wasn't able to earn money fast enough on things that would in reality turn a quick profit. But overall it was very well balanced it's tough to make a game of this nature just look at the laundry list of problems with the sim city games and you'll see what I mean. There is one problem I found amusing after a time I had nearly all of my citizens passing high level college to the point where none wanted to work on my farms. I was forced to make farming the most high paid job on the island to keep people from starving.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Would recommend this game if you are looking for a city building game with a bit of a challenge unlike sim city this gives you goals the whole way through to keep you busy and working to and end goal which is kind of nice. Another thing I like is how its not over the top complex like sim city so you dont need to run water and power lines and control traffic on the roads and what not. So you are not left micro managing the city nearly as much as you do in sim city.			",397,105,22,75,96,4,99

												I've always found city builders to be addictive, and this is no exception. Tropico has a lot of replay value and has kept me entertained throughout most of the campaign missions and challenges. It does tend to get repetitive, but the different goals for each campaign and the slight changes in storyline are enough to prevent it from being outright boring. It's just a shame that there's no world builder here. I'd love to create my own island and challenges. That's really the only thing missing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is fun. Though not for the serious gamer it's a bit comical at times and deliberately bigoted in places for a quick laugh. I loved the options menus for choosing islands and settings. You knew exactly what to expect and had complete freedom to modify even the slightest details. The character skins were lacking but in game you almost never use el presidente so it's easily forgiven. The game could allow for longer play since I was only able to reach year 2115 before it would hard lock constantly. The pacing was good a little hard at times it felt like I wasn't able to earn money fast enough on things that would in reality turn a quick profit. But overall it was very well balanced it's tough to make a game of this nature just look at the laundry list of problems with the sim city games and you'll see what I mean. There is one problem I found amusing after a time I had nearly all of my citizens passing high level college to the point where none wanted to work on my farms. I was forced to make farming the most high paid job on the island to keep people from starving.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is amazing fun and is good for many hours of entertainment. As somebody who keeps trying to play city builders and constantly fails, this was a good change of pace as it is easily accessible to anybody at any level.  Pros:First of all, this game has great humor to it. Between the overt political humor, the banter of Juanito and Betty Boom on the radio, and various other in game jokes, it's almost certain to get some laughs out of you. Second, this game is exceptionally forgiving. While most city builders start to become babysitting jobs as the city becomes larger and complex, Tropico honestly doesn't have that many serious crises. Debt, unemployment, rebel activity, and random world event are all easily dealt with and do not require a lot of micromanagement. It honestly feels as if you are able to mostly just build and forget. Third, the political system within the game is an enjoyable part of running Tropico. I believe that there are seven or eight various political parties with various demands that have to be met. Failing to meet these demands can result in huge penalties (such as the militarists attempting a coup) and can cost you votes during election times. Yes you may essentially be dictator, but you do have the choice of allowing elects. Holding an election and handily winning an election by a huge margin is extremely fulfilling. Cons:After a couple of hours of playing you will notice that the game's soundtrack gets old and that eventually the radio djs become rather annoying. You'll also notice that eventually the building choices start to become exceptionally old. I can't remember how many times I made huge neighborhoods full of apartment blocks or relied on the same resources for my economy. Buying the Absolute Power DLC helps open up new choices, but it really doesn't add that many buildings that you'll find to be useful (with the windmill and the balloon ride being exceptions). Overall, buy this if you love building cities and may not have the most patience for more complex games like Sim City or Cities XL that require large amounts of micromanagement. 8.5/10 ",34,8,0,8,8,1,20

												Fun and addictive. After seeing Tropico in the sale, i decided to take the plunge - 12 hours later, I know i've made the right decision. Tropico allows the player to oversee all aspects of an island community without going into too much depth, thus allowing it to flow smoothly and keeping the player interested by cutting out trivial micro- management. You'll easily lose yourself in the game whilst your money is slowly accumulating and the catchy samba tunes have been in my head all day. Great game, definitely recommend it!			",18,1,0,3,6,0,0

												Great fun to start with, but if there's oil or metal on your island then the entire mission becomes pretty pointless. As soon as you export weapons and oil your money goes through the roof and everyone get nice food and a villa. Also, with larger towns/cities I found that the game started to lag and stutter a little bit and then even struggle with empty islands until I rebooted the game - but I'm not running a high end machine so it could just be that. Definitely worth the money though and fun to drop back in to.			",27,3,0,2,6,0,16

												After another successful defense of one of my oil refineries from a rebel attack, my aide informs me that the people are calling for an election. As any just and noble dictator would do, I had the faction leaders eliminated and rigged the election in my favor.Tropico 3 is a basic city builder, not as in-depth as the Anno series but just as fun. Resource gathering, building production buildings, social buildings, and balancing the needs of your citizens with the goal of each island mission.One of my favorite missions required me to reach a money goal by the end of my term. I could set up hotels and entertainment, focus all my attention on growing food, or build a bunch of oil wells and iron mines. The choice was mine and any mistakes would not be noticed until further along in the mission which gives a sense of my actions having real consequences. How you want to play is up to you. Enjoy city building and resource managment? This is a game for you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
