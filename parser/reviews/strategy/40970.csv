												Your popularity...*Dramatic pause*IS RISING!Update:Wow, I honestly never imagined that this joke would reach the lengths it did. I suppose this justifies an actual review.Welcome to Stronghold Crusader, a game I picked up at a whim when I was 12 (actually have about 1,000 hours clocked in the disc version of the game; I was sheltered from Steam for a long time). I had, at the time, no idea what the game was about, I just knew that I was a huge medieval era fan and decided the game looked pretty cool. Trust me though, no matter of sweet, sweet disc cover could have prepared me for the fungasm that was Stronghold Crusader. Lets move on to an actual review now.Stronghold Crusader is an RTS (real-time strategy) game based on the First, Second, and Third Crusade, not to mention the conflicts within Crusader states. As with all RTS', this means that you will have control of armies, workers, not to mention fortification and building construction in an attempt to outwit your opponent and kill their king. However, Stronghold does this better than even most current-generation RTS', in my opinion, including games like Starcraft 2. It's hard for me to come up with a ""pros and cons"" list, because for me, this game doesn't have any cons; difficulty is to be expected as you progress in time spent in-game. Let me spend a little time bulleting what is so attractive about this game.-There is a multitude of units. You've got your various siege equipment (battering rams, catapults, trebuchets, you name it), melee units with their own unique advantages, ranged units similarly, various traps, MOATS (that's right nerdy kid who loves castles, moats), and chances are you will end up using every single one of these characters at some point during the game; which leads to my next point.-No two games are alike. Before anyone corrects me, I'm aware that there are (always have been) certain strategies to try and end games quickly; slave rushing; mercenary armies in early game, etc. That being said, these strategies are not always reliable and will leave you resourceless. The fact is that you are probably going to need a different strategy for each game you play, ESPECIALLY in multiplayer.-The game itself is rich in history, which I personally find fascinating. The single player campaign will have you drilling your way through multiple missions; these missions are based off the real accounts of the First, Second, and Third Crusades, as well as the intergroup struggles that grew in that time. You will command armies in historic battles like the Siege of Jerusalem, Heraclea, and Krak des Chevaliers. All this is accompanied by what I find to be a stellar set of voice actors and most likely the best squire a king could ever ask for creates an almost life-like representation of the era. You know what, the squire gets his own bullet.-The squire; this awesome individual is your in-game guide/cheerleader/father-figure. If you play the game, you WILL learn to love him. The squire is a non-physical character who informs you of how you are doing, whether you are under attack, or if you are out of resources. He will sit and shout in your ear ""WOOD NEEDED"" or ""THE GRANARY STOCKS ARE FULL, M'LORD."" -Resource management. While not really a new feature to RTS', the resource management in this game will force you to think steps ahead of your opponent, or suffer the consequences; every resource is expendable. ""Not enough stone to build your walls? Buy some from the trade post for gold, or trade your other resources to get that precious stone. Beware, though, trade too much of one resource and it may dry up and your stocks will quickly be depleted, which means you are screwed when it comes to anything that requires that resource.-Multiplayer. This is where 90% of my horus playing this game went. I could sit here and rant onward about all of my games where I had almost lost, but like the underdog of the story, I prevailed!However, I won't; as a matter of fact, I will make this really simple: take every bulletpoint I've created, and imagine what it'd be like to face another person. The campaign missions may not necessarily be the most difficult, but the multiplayer is where I am convinced Army strategists should be trained for real-life duty. How you act in a game, every move you make, every resource you spend/use, will affect the outcome and decide whether you are truly the king of the land, or whether you are a lonely peasant, not fit to lick the boot of your opponent.TL;DR:Despite not being the most ""relevant"" entry in the RTS genre, Stronghold Crusader still manages to remain an idol to be followed for other RTS games. If you are truly skipping my beautifully composed points above, just know that the game is wonderful. For the price it's listed at now, I would say you are criminally insane to not buy it.""Do you recommend this game?"" Steam asks.My response? ""Of course, m'lord!""			",72,8,0,6,6,0,3

												If anyone ever asked me what was my favorite game as a kid, it would be Stronghold Crusader hand down. Today I keep it on steam to leave my old disc on the shelf as a momento of my childhood. SC is a classic with the perfect balance of light hearted castle sim charm and rts combat. Ive dumped easily 1000 hours into random skirmish matches against the ai lords over the years and this is one game that I can always turn back to at any time to pass 20 minutes to 2 hours and always have a good time. Learning how to balance your economy to support troop creation has a very mild learning curve but it takes time to master but yet is simple enough for even a 1st grader to learn as I did when I first started playing this game in 2001.This game has aged exceptionally well and still has an active multiplayer community because anyone that ever took a bite of this game knows just how good it really is. I strongly reccommend this game to add to your collection as an old fan or a newby looking for a new toy to reignite your passion for gaming all over again. Overall, I would rate this title 11/10 as it really is a unicorn in the PC gaming realm. Thank you			",127,11,1,16,28,0,56

An old masterpiece came to Steam - in High Definition (or atleast high resolution...)I remember, when I was a little boy about 9 years old, I saw this game in a market and I begged my dad to buy me this RTS-game. I played everyday and it was never boring - not even a little bit! And now it is here - on Steam! Feeling the satisfaction of building your own castle while at the same time demolishing someone else's. Just. Great.to the m'lord-cave!++ best ""Stronghold""++ it's a classic+ one of the best RTS (in my opinion!)+ 16 different enemies with special tactics!+ many maps (whether balanced or not)+ historical missions+ 2 campaigns (2nd campaign is much harder!)+ skirmish mode! (80 missions)+ different modes: the peaceful and war path+ loads of playable options+ create your own maps!+ easy gameplay and easy to learn the mechanics+ no food? no fear! - beer is here!+ and it won't get boring - only harder :)+ you don't need a high-end gamer ultra 4k PC""buildings are in flames m'lord!""- HD? Just the resolution changed- ma' crusade ended 1781 AC (depends on how long you play)- AI won't build armies over 400 soldiers- The Kalif is an as*hole- what year is it?- campaign is less ""personal"" - got killed by 100 slaves- often you can easily rush the enemy in the first minutes- double rations- some people can't run the game! (you are warned)A little extra information: in ""Stronghold Crusader Extreme"" you are able to build armies up to 10000 soldiers... and the enemy too ;-)just an information if you would complain about the limited army size, like I mentioned before :-)Those negative aspects are just poop, so don't mention them.I can tell that you WILL have lot of fun. I'm through the first 50 missions and already at 35 hours! You don't need a sale to buy this, just 8€ and you recieve hours of fun. Don't mind the graphics, it's from 2002! But remember - This is a recommendation for Stronghold Crusader and not for the whole series (sadly the game became more and more worse).""Do you recommend this game?""- ""Of course, m'lord!"" 9/10little update: I am through the 100 missions of the crusade and have about ~60 hours playtime (because of connection problems, my counted hours are false)... and I didn't even started the real campaign :-DI think if you play every mission, campaign and possible option you can reach 100 hours!Some people have the problem that the game doesn't start at all - maybe this thread can help you: http://steamcommunity.com/app/40970/discussions/0/361787186433062259/ ",134,14,3,25,19,0,28

*****5 out of 5The gaming equivalent of heaven.Stronghold Crusader is a castle building strategy game. Whether you like castles or medieval times is irrelevant, if you like strategy games you will adore this game.Coming off the successful 2001 hit Stronghold, Stronghold Crusader removes and improves elements of its predecessor to galore the public with a map editor and a skirmish mode, however for newcomers a game tutorial is sadly not available.

												One of the first installments in the Stronghold series. An epic strategy game, with poor graphics that are made up for in amazing gameplay. You battle in the campaign or the trial series or just skirmish. You can have amazing battles with other players or AIs. Tons of different maps and a map builder that allows you to do anything. Great fps, and no crashes. I love this game, and if you like a good strategy game, you'll love this to.			",81,15,1,19,24,0,30

												This game is a classic, I remember playing the demo sometime back in like, early 2002...? Can't really remember, but even today it holds great quality for a game this old. Graphics are obviously quite dated, but considering that the game was acctualy released in 2002 they arn't THAT bad, infact they are quite impressive and back in 2002 they were most likely very high standards. The gameplay is excellent, watching battles between 2 factions are just incredible. 500-600 men fighting for victory. The AI is smart and very, very different depening on which settings you play on. Some AI are REALLY slow whilst others are REALLY fast. This is both good and bad but it will keep you entertained for a good time. What makes this game so entertaining is that you must always keep your economy, troop producment, and other vital producments above your opponent. If not, you will most likely lose.The only REAL flaw with this game is that it has ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of glitches, and the AI can sometime get stuck when they build their castle.8/10			",90,11,21,9,20,0,11

What began as a subtle, but highly erotic and mind-opening series of short stories has now become a career of mine. This game is the reason I'm making the big bucks with manuscripts like ""Lionheart Shows His Richard"" and ""INside Saladin"". I am in the process of my first screenplay ""What Needs...

												There's nothing much like building a huge empire castle with seemingly undefetable defenses, and than it all falls apart just because your friend was one step ahead of you the whole time building his army of tens of thousands of men to take down your castle. Stronghold Crusader HD delivers this on every level. This game and I go way back, to 2006, My brother chose this game as a game that he wanted to buy from Target. At first I hated this game, mostly because I didn't try it. After I did try it one rainy day I fell in love with it. It does take a little bit to learn everything, but once you do it is one of the most addicting and fact paced Stragety games of all time!PROS:+ Simple but nice graphics: Sure they aren't amazing, but it has a disctinct art style that does help make you feel more a part of that world.+ Amazing strategic gameplay, It lures you in by seeming to be simple with a decent+The voice acting AWFUL, but it is the kind of awful that you and your friends can have a good hearty laugh at, and of course the quotes with the ""voice actors"" deliver really helps make this game feel all its own and have it's entirely own feeling to it.+ Fun Characters: the characters have their own personalities, and while some are addmitedly one note (the pig is fat GET IT!?) It adds more that subtracts from the experiance.+Great Map Selection (Some very basic ones and some really interesting ones, over 20! (Over 100 if you look at just the skirmish ones [Although I do belive they are exclusive to skirmish which I would like to see changed and probally there is a way to do it manually] And of coruse, you can make your own.)+ A ton of Gameplay types. There is, Custom Map Maker, 4 (or 4+) Campaigns, 3 (Including the Extreme Expansion) Trials (Which are linked matches between you and a bot, there are 50 on the original one. 30 on the Warchest one and 20 on the Extreme Trails) But, there is a major problem with the extreme trials (as of 12/30/13) it starts you at the final one for some reason) and of coruse Skirmish Mode (You can play what map you want with either friends, or solo and choose teams and such. oh and one more thing, Castle Sim Mode is just like Skirmish Mode, but without the batltes. ))+Fantastic Music! It is not only atmospheric but can also be catchy as hell and sounds natural helping the imersion of the game by a boatload! The game even changes music depending on the situation you are in, are you getting bombarded by a bunch of spear men? Then the game will switch to an intense battle song and fade out as soon as you (hopefull) defeat the spearmen. +The netcode is HIGHLY improoved in my experiances to the original, back in the original every game would be pleagued by the infamous ""Connection lost, sending current game state"" message, however  if I do ever encounter it in this version it dissapears in a split second!+This version is compatable with the original! So, if your friends computer can't handle the brand new resolution just install the CD version and you can play with the HD version (with GameRanger of course!) and this helps blend the line between the Steam players and the CD Players. The same can not be said about AOE2 HD or RON:EXE.+The game runs great on all types of hardware, from my ancient (Basically) 2010 Notebook to my modern computer (which I am writing this review with) and even my Aspire R14, the game runs without a hitch and surprisingly has minimal compatibility glitches [Not including the ones that were there]CONS:+Troops sometimes ignore orders, or take a while to do them. Sometimes you will tell it to do something and they will just wonder off which gets annoying especially in the heat of battle.+It's sometimes hard to see close into your castle with the brand new resolution, it would be nice if you could zoom into the map even further.+Some AI share the same animations (most notably, The Rat and the Wolf if you have them on your team.+Some Animation's are choppy (The blacksmith preview goes at about 20 frames)+When you zoom out all the way the FPS halves.+The AI is awful. They rarley (if ever) change up their attacks and do the same thing over and over again. Some AI is over protective making invading their castle a hastle [hahaha! GET IT!] to a point where I just save the game, quit, and never return to that saved game. +Balancing Issues: Little problems that they are you may have to (atleast in multiplayer) turn on the No Rush timer as to not allow people to bombard your castle with Assassins which are not only fast, invisible (unless nearing your men), and strong, but they also have a surprisingly large health bar which makes killing them annoying as they mow down even your strongest men and take out your king (how you loose) without a problem as early as the first few minutes. [They fixed this in the 2nd Game however that is a whole different can of worms.]+No proper Steamworks Multiplayer support, you must download a game client like GameRanger (which isn't bad, just inconvenient] +Awful expansion. Stronghold Crusader HD Extreme is the included expansion and adds some fantastic stuff [Maps, campaigns, 8 new AI Characters] but sadly starts to support castle hiding where you hide everyone inside your castle and let you generate stuff (yes this expansion adds a Mana styled magic bar that lets you create stuff and destroy your enemies castle with flying rocks that you spawn) which sounds badass. However, it throws all balancing and fairness out the window. Anyone can click on the rocks and click on the enemy castle to demolish it and make it ripe for the conquest, however what Stronghold Crusader HD (The base game) strives on is the ability to conquest the castle using your men that you build up which makes it imsenly more satisfying and more fair to put it bluntly.+Glitches. The main one that I am talking about is when you launch SC:HD Extreme for the first time and you go to the skirmish mission you get the due honor of skipping directly to the last level for no apparent reason, effectivly making the previous 20 or so missions useless. Overall:Even in the ripe year of 2016 Stronghold Crusader HD has surprisingly aged well. The problems (Some miniscule others annoying) really don't distract from the overall experiance as much as one may think. The PROS FAR outweigh the CONS in this situation and makes Stronghold Crusader HD (even with the Flawed Extreme expansion) a great time that is easily worth the 9.99 asking price. And even if you don't feel confortable about paying that much it goes on sale for down to 5 dollars sometimes so keep an eye out because I assure you, its a game that you will need to see to believe. [In a good way]If you enjoyed this review you should check out my fellow reviewers at  Completing the Backlog Edit: And hey this game has some great uses for cows...			",174,25,4,10,16,1,18

This is a long review, so if you want a brief summary of why I recommend Stronghold Crusader skip to Results and read from there.Firefly Studies strikes again with the best Stronghold game in the series. Stronghold Crusader is a brilliant game that mixes Castle Simulation with RTS combat, and resource management. Story:As the title depicts Stronghold Crusader takes place in the Crusades. You play through the Asia minor, The Middle East, as Europeans and Arabians alike. The story takes place across four campaigns where you start your journey as Emporer Alexus of the Turkish Army commands you to take ahold of Asia Minor. You spread European influence across the land, but it is short lived as the Salidan rises to power and destroys the settlements of the Europeans and claims back the lands. Unfortunately for him the crusades were not over, and the Germanic armies arrive deploying castles across Asia minor as they claim lay to the holy lands. Stronghold Crusader takes place across the first to third crusades and then creates an alternate reality that is the post-crusade wars that pit you against your worst nightmare: The Rat, The Snake, The Pig, and The Wolf. Campaign:Stronghold Crusader has four campaigns which teach you how to play the game from the basics to the most advanced.The Call to ArmsCall to Arms offers five basic missions which although simple are in fact challenging in their own rights. The first mission encompasses basic castle siege, the second basic defense, the third resource management, the fourth resource massing, and the final one a more complicated castle siege. This campaign is a great way to start into the Stronghold Series as it introduces the elements of gameplay in an interesting way that keeps you entertained. Typical tutorials are rather uninteresting, but Call to Arms changes that by providing dynamic missions that introduce the game with diverse scenarios. Saladin’s ConquestAfter the conquest of Call to Arms you pick up the campaign as Salidan who is retaking the land stolen by the Europeans. All the missions in Salidan’s Conquest are sieges; these involve taking castles from the enemy. All of Salidans missions are rather simple, yet offer diversity in how you conquer your foe. You are limited on units and must use unique units to push through the enemy defenses. The Kings CrusadeAfter the Salidan has kicked out most of Europe the quest continues as the third crusade picks up and its up to the Europeans to hold off their fortresses from the Salidans onslaughts. The Kings Crusade mostly focuses on castle building and defense, similar to Mission 4 of The Call to Arms. Each level provides new features which give you a better mechanism to defend you castle and equip you against an ever stronger foe until you eventually must siege castle and rebuild it from the ground up. Crusader StatesThe campaign begins after the third crusade and is a fictitious rendition of what we expected after the Third Crusade ended. You play in the Middle East as lord’s squalor over various lands and it is up to you to defeat your foes. Your mission through the Middle East pits you against the foes of the past: The Rat, The Snake, The Pig, and The Wolf. The further you get into the campaign the more enemies you get pit against. Gameplay:Stronghold Crusader is noted as being the best Stronghold game; it took what was good from the original and expanded upon it beautifully. Stronghold Crusader is a castle simulation game, where you manage a castle politically, economically, and sociologically. You must maintain various food types, keep your people happy, while simultaneously ripping them dry for every penny they have. You need to build a well-oiled machine, but unlike most strategy games Stronghold has many resources. To build units you must obtain gold, you must build their weapons, you must provide peasant, you must feed them with various food stocks, and you must obtain the resources required to build those weapons. For all of this to occur you must keep peasants within your castle by making sure they are happy, once they start to leave your castle will crumble from within before your enemies even hit your walls. Stronghold Crusader takes that and incorporates mercenaries, units which cost gold and require less work to obtain. Of course they cost almost triple that of a non-hired unit, but offer quick turn-around. Not only did they add mercenaries, but they included Skirmishes with AI, which allow you to play the game without playing the campaign. The AI is rather intelligent and will keep you on your toes, and not only that but the maps are designed to require intense combat. This game will make you fight over limited agrarian land and low wood stocks. Hints:>When you start a map drop the gamespeed to 20, this gives you loads of time to set yourself up before the match really begins.>When playing the crusader states the game gives you sometimes up to 7.5k gold, if you drop the game-speed to 20 and place a market you can buy Maces and Leather Armor. Then quickly build an army of Macemen to take out your foes before the match can even begin. This does not work on all missions, but certainly helps.>Bread is the easiest food to build-up. If you are trying to optimize limited farmland use wheat as its easy to mass. Results:Stronghold Crusader is the best castle simulation game out there right now. It offers the joy of castle simulation with the intensities of combat. I would recommend this game to anyone who is thinking about taking part in the Stronghold Series, it’s a great place to start as it will pull you right in. Stronghold Crusader is a fantastic game for castle simulation fans and real time strategy fans alike. I would recommend this buying this game even at full price, but if you can get it at a discount its worth every penny and you won’t regret it. Pros:+Four amazing campaigns which teach you how to play the game without being boring or repetitive.+The AI has various levels of intelligence which makes them fun as well as challenging.+They added mercenaries which allow you to build emergency armies quick, but cost extraordinary sums of gold. +Finally Skirmishes have been introduced; you don’t have to play the campaign or multiplayer. You can just mess around by yourself. +New strategic limitations, such as limited grass for agriculture which makes you consider your strategies.Cons:-I couldn’t minimize the game; it would minimize but not maximize (Windows 8.1)-When playing you could not open steam overlay, one of the commands for steam overlay is a command for the games GUI display.

												Even though I only have 2.3 hrs on record in Steam. I bought this game on the disk (yes disk) around 10-11 years ago when it came out.The online scene was buzzing and me and up to 6 friends used to constantly skirmish on Gamespy Arcade. Now Gamespy is dead, you can only play another player through the IP option which is a little fiddly, but it is doable.The AI in this game is pretty good and you dont need to play humans to be challenged. The game is a timeless gem and I would recomend it to anyone. Crusader is by far the best in the series. Stronghold 1 is great is your playing the campaign. But I wouldn't go any further down the line than that, Firefly studios went down hill. If your in to top down stratergy games, this game is amazing. I'd advise you watch Total Biscuits video on it, he explains it very well.Go buy it, then contact me on steam if you want a game or a co-op partner! :D			",314,65,20,22,20,3,26

												Another great classic among strategy games. Definately worth looking for Medieval History enthusiasts, Age of Empires players and generally everyone that's looking forward to a well done Castle Building (quite similar to city building with a military approach) Strategy Real-Time game.The style makes this very unique.The music speaks for a lot, with authentic and faithfully created Arab flutes, the desert everywhere! It's really worth it, even if the ""HD"" doesn't look as great as some other remakes - it works great and that's all that I personally could ask for, as there isn't that much to improve here really aside from issues with launching the game.

												The time I played this game says it all. I can recommend all of the Stronghold games but Stronghold Crusader is the best one and it was my first PC game when I started 9 years ago.I played the HD-version on Steam 300 hours in the last 1 1/2 years and uncountable hours before I bought it on Steam.Pros:- good price- 2 Crusades (2x50 missions) and 4 historical campaigns (4x4 missions)- Multiplayer against or with other players on Game Ranger-  a lot of siege equipment (catapult,ballista,trebuchets etc.) and troops (arabs and crusaders)- authentic landscapes- create your own multiplayer maps- epic music and characters- better graphicsCons: I cannot really find a negative aspect. It is fun to play alone and with friends.- Maybe it gets boring sometimes, but there is always a reason to play it from time to time.The game is almost as old as I am and first published for Windows 98, so do not expect too much and just have fun.

												My first strategy-type game I have ever played in my childhood. This is where my thirst and hunger for winning started. This may not be for people that are playing a game and evaluating it from a graphical side. It is 2002 game, so.. In my opinion it is pretty strategic and fun to play.My first time that I had to play this game was horrible, because I had absolutelly no logic (Yes, you need to have brain to play this game. This is not just building and done). What I was doing back then just building beautiful buildings, such as church and etc. I didn't know what I was doing. So, when I grew up, I got into this game out of nostalgia. I understood what I was doing at that time, and it was lmao to remember what I was doing back there... xDSo, as I said, this game needs logic, because you are not going to survive and win by doing random♥♥♥♥♥♥ You start up in different locations of the map with your opponents and you the point is to build your castle, make troops and protect yourself and slaughter them. But the most logical part of the game, is management of resources. Gold, stone, wood, food, iron. Nothing complicated. The food is the most essential resource for surviving obviously. Without it, people will leave your castle and you have nothing... So after you have dispatched resource income in appriopriate way and value, you have to build up you castle (That's my favourite part, because you can build in any way you want) and protect it, because everything is risky. They can target your resource income building, which can leave you empty and put you at a disadvantage. Thinking through stuff, and protecting everything is the key. After building up stage, some obviously will choose to attack, and some of them will have to defend. Defending is the most fun part, because after you dispatched your troops at appropriate locatons of defense (such as towers) for protection, it is so satisfying to see how strong is your defense, and after that you can find your weakness. Then, it is up to you, you build up your army, you slaughter, you win. That's all. Also there are campaign and other modes which can give a little bit of a challenge against other opponents. Some stages will be hard, and will give you a location with disadvantages, but it is up to you how you will build up, survive, destroy and win.That I think is everything to this game. I recommend it for players that are interested in strategic. (Bu I am guessing there are people who have started their journey from this one and what I mean is that they already tried it).

												A lot of sequels strike out in new directions, and end up falling flat for their trouble. Sometimes they get too far away from what made the original great, and other times they find a way to ruin that original appeal. The other side of the coin is that just giving players more of the original risks making the series stale. This is the approach that Stronghold Crusader took in the wake of Stronghold's success, but the sheer volume of content more than makes up for the lack of innovation.Just as you did in Stronghold, Crusader challenges you to erect and manage castles throughout a variety of scenarios and skirmishes. Once your keep and granary are placed, it's up to you to site farms, mills, workshops, and homes to keep your people safe and happy. So long as you remain a popular ruler more people will come serve at your castle, but more people means a greater drain on your resources. In the midst of balancing these two factors you'll need to raise walls and armies to fend off invaders seeking your crown.The familiar moors of England have given way to the marauding Moors of the holy land for this outing. There are a few big changes to be aware of, most notably the desert maps. Gone are the rolling fields of the first game, instead leaving you with small oases to supply your essential farms and woodcutters. A mercenary post allows you to recruit new Arabian units, everything from armored swordsmen to wall-scaling assassins. There's even a rudimentary diplomacy system, allowing you to form alliances and request resources.Stronghold Crusader features four historical campaigns, focusing on different parts of the Crusades. Each campaign is five scenarios long and features a gentle learning curve that provides a fair challenge by the end. There's little story to be found here in contrast with Stronghold's tale of political maneuvering, just some blurbs about historical relevance. The real meat of the game is the Crusader mode, a campaign of up to 50 battles against AI opponents. Right from the get-go you can access all the buildings and options the game has to offer in pursuit of conquest, building your perfect citadel and laying siege to nearby enemies. The strategy of castle-to-castle warfare takes a little getting used to after the easy pace of the campaigns, but it's thrilling to launch pitched battles and deploy siege engines to topple your foes.There's not a lot of innovation to be found here over the original Stronghold, but there really doesn't need to be. Crusader instead gives you plenty more to see and do, especially on the military side. The graphics are a bit improved, with sharper structures and cleaner animations, and the sounds of both peace and battle are just as immersive as before. Honestly, I consider this the superior game just due to the depth of content and the little additions to the proven formula. If you're looking for endless conquest and sieges, this is the Stronghold title you want.			",488,212,8,71,62,7,65

												Stronghold: Crusader is an RTS (real time strategy) game based in the Middle East during the Crusades, namely mainly in the third. Some parts of the game, however, take place before that. It's a kind of extension of the game Stronghold, which Crusader in many aspects resembles, but Stronghold is set in medieval England.Stronghold: Crusader is Stronghold enriched with new mechanics, the most famous of these is the Skirmish mode, the heart of the game. It is a mode in which each player or computer opponent has one base on a map and they must develop, market, prosper and build castles and defense. Since all players are on one map, they can interact with each other, whether it's positively or negatively. Allies can trade with each other, defend each other and attack together. The game goal is most of the time to kill all the enemy Lords and not die in the process. The game balances the economy and the war very well. The player must develop their economy through taxes, food rations, trade and so on. They must seek to balance their popularity to not become unpopular, because in that case people will begin to leave the castle and it will severely impede the player's progress. If the player has a good economy, they can take up making a great army, which is usually quite costly. This is the way the game balances the economy and the war, and I like it. You should think about your tactics and castle management a bit and not just rush into war straight away - otherwise you go to your knees, whether you like it or not.The main objectives of the game itself are the 2 Skirmish trails. They consist of a number of consecutive Skirmishes. In each mission the player has certain enemies, sometimes allies, a set map and everyone's position on it, and a set amount of money and resources. There are 16 PC enemies altogether and about 80 maps (citation needed), so with such diversity there is also an option to play your own game, where the player chooses the map, their allies and adversaries as well as everyone's money and resources. Computer opponents are also quite diverse: 6 Arab and 10 Crusader leaders, each of whom has different castles, different tactics, different personalities, and there's a lot to the game to keep you interested long enough.In addition to Skirmish trails, one can play historical campaigns. They're based on specific historical periods and events during the Crusades. They are there to teach the player the game. The first campaign teaches the fundamentals of the economy, defense and siege. The second campaign teaches the player how to use unique Arab units. In the third campaign the player learns to defend against them, and the fourth campaign is already full-on Skirmish mode. In the first three campaigns the player doesn't have the Skirmish mode freedom because they either defend against attacks at certain intervals, while trying to achieve a set goal (Defend Antioch! Gather 300 loaves of bread!, and the like), while they often don't have access to all buildings - or they get a certain number of soldiers with which to conquer a city. This is exactly why a lot of people find these campaigns boring, tedious and difficult. In a sense they are right. These campaigns are fine, but cumbersome unlike the rest of the game. The game also includes a mode of free castle building without enemies, map editor and LAN multiplayer for 8 players.Crusader Extreme added a bar of (super)powers, which fills up slowly and over time unlocks the abilities for your use - such as a rain of arrows or rocks on a specific place on the map. It also added military outposts - buildings that relatively slowly generate troops for free. This allows all PC adversaries to be stronger than normal - for example the Rat, the weakest adversary, suddenly gets a huge army of swordsmen, pikemen, horse archers and seven catapults - and they're coming for you!Overall, I think that Stronghold: Crusader is an excellent game. Fun and fast paced with minor weak points and bugs, which can be overlooked. 9/10PS: The Steam version doesn't cooperate with Steam firefly fix pls			",27,13,4,5,11,2,6

												A fun and nostalgic game. Brings back some fine memories from childhood.There are some bugs however that makes some campaign maps unplayable. After playing some maps for a while the game speed gets locked on the slowest speed and it can't be changed regardless of what game speed i choose. When this happens the game also starts recognizing my clicks very poorly so i often have to press multiple times on something in order for the game to respond. When this happens i also can not attack the enemy lords with meele soldiers as they simply can not walk up the stairs to the enemy citadel. This means that it would take an eternity to take out the enemy lords with arrows on the slowest game speed. This whole thing only happens on certain maps though.Apart from those annoying bugs it is a great game!			",19,1,0,1,2,0,3

												Looking for a good RTS? Look no Further.This game is the pinnacle of quality for the Stronghold series. The first game lacks the depth that Crusader has, but is still very good. Problem is that every game after this one, in the Stronghold series, just doesn't measure up. This game has a perfect blend of complexity and simplicity.The game isn't so complicated that its hard to pick up or understand, but not so simple that there is a lack of depth.Likewise the play of the game is balanced between economics/resources management and Military strategy. In some other RTS games it is absolutely true that whoever can rush their economy the fastest is the victor, and I would say that is not the case for this game. Speed is of course an important factor, but unless one player is particularly slow in comparision to the other, speed will not be the deciding factor. The ability you have for using your economy to maximize your military potential through any number of means, as well as your ability to strategically use your troops/resources to take advantage of your opponent's weaknesses are the most important factors.However, understanding your map placement while using this in your overall strategy, and your ability to build/defend your castle are extremely important. A player near less resources with a weaker economy can play more defensively, defeat an opponent's army who lays siege, and then counter attack before the opponent can recover from the losses to pull a victory. Or in the same scenario, the player in a weak spot can harass with the goal to destroy their opponent's economy, thus crippling them, then pressing the advantage. The ways a game can be played and won are vast.Multiplayer is where this depth of gameplay becomes most visible, but due to the direct IP connect multiplayer set up it is easiest to just use a service with lobbies to set up games with randoms. I recommend Game Ranger. The community isn't huge, but is still large enough that it isn't hard to find someone online to play with.From my perspective, this is the greatest RTS of all time.Keeping my personal bias aside, this game is very good, especially for it's time.I believe it is an under appreciated title worth picking up for it's price.TL;DR : Graphics are okay, not confusing or hard to look at, but not stunning due to their age.Gameplay is not without it's flaws, but it is in depth and the application of strategy, awareness, and quick thinking are key. Making use of European and/or Arabic units is also an important element.Multiplayer is fun and much more in depth than playing with bots, but its better to use an external program for matchmakingModes; there are a few to choose from, Multiplayer, custom game mode, there is custom map making which can be shared with other players in multiplayer, Single player has two crusader trails which set you up against bots in specific set ups, and a historical single player mode where you defend real crusader castles like Kerak de Chevaliers.Sounds/Soundtrack nothing I would write home about, but its not hard to listen to either.Should you read this review, and then decide to buy this game and thenwant to get in on multiplayer, feel free to add me.

												Stronghold Crusader came out mid 2002 after the succesful Stronghold in 2001. Stronghold Crusader is set in the Middle East during the crusades rather then Europe like the first one, hence the name Crusader. This is a real time stratergy game with the focus of killing the enemy Lord/s. Careful though as he will be very strong and can take over 10000 archer arrows! don't worry it is done on purpose so you can kill him at a range, so best to send 10 plus swords men at him.If you played the Original like I did many moons ago there are changes in this HD edition and NONE! are bad. There are 8 more characters to verus, more resolution sizes and graphics has imporved. Everything else is the same as the original which is amazing!So the Pro's:- Personally the best out of all Strongholds- Unique RTS that requires not only military stratergies but also civil (do you make them drunk and fed or starve and whip them?)- Arabian units are an awesome edition giving alot more unit choice- Fire implementation in the game is great, see random guys on fire turn a city into a flame ball (happens more often then you think), yes this is a pro!!- Large campaign and a few side stories 'missions'- Great to plan with mates (LAN or over the net)- Replayability in custom maps or make your own which is easily shared to other pc's when trying to match make- alot of challanging Lords to play- Fun castle building and designing to fit all military and civil works in and aroundCon's- 400 unit pop count, may sound like alot but it isn't when you are trying to kill 7 Lord's at once- The Large map for 8 Players can seem very small in most instances- If AI Lords placed close together or near iron it is create holes or even block themsleves in starving their kingdom.- No unit or building healing (can repair towers and that's it)- Would be good to make AI even harder, they have Lords to difficulty but it would be good if you can adjust it more- Most of the time units will not attack the enemy until they are either told or the enemy are already bashing their face in- Enemy AI with their army can be very disorganized making them easy preyOverall I love this edition of Stronghold Crusader HD, I will continue to use it and LAN with friends. If you want a LAN game to kill some time this is great for you! (better to vs your friends for more of a challange).any questions don't be afriad to ask.			",63,5,1,23,9,0,28

Keeping your castle busy by chopping wood, minning stone and iron, making weapons/armors, and making food/drink. Challenging levels keep you thinking about how you can approach the enemy.

												Why dont they make games like this anymore? The AI is amazing, the wolf is a♥♥♥♥♥♥ the Caliph is a ISIS maniac, the Pig and Rat are like cartoon villains that never do anything right, and you know whats awesome? They build and command EXACTLY like their personality goes, its so cool, and the whole city building system is very good, with a lot of emphasis on having a working economy and keeping your people working.Also, wood needed.

												Probably the best strategy game of all time. Well, until Stronghold Crusader 2 comes out.Played this game since I got my first computer and continued playing it to this day. There has been some breaks when I haven't played this, but always when I accidentally watch like a video of this game or something like that (now I accidentally found it on Steam) after a long break I get this urgent need to install it again and play it all the time. Seriously I'd rate this game 10/10 and put it in my top 5 games ever. Long story short, old but gold.EDIT: I was wrong about Stronghold Crusader 2. This one is still the best.			",103,4,3,9,10,2,6

												'Ahhh Running out of tax again, fetch me the tax collector!'-The SherrifI don't have many hours on steam, but besides from steam i probably have hundreds of hours into this game. It doesn't have the flashy graphics from nowadays but the gameplay and the depht is amazing. Every A.I. Character has it's own strenghts and weaknesses. From the Rat being mid game downright anyoing because of his infinite units spams of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ economically devastating units if he breaches your defences somehow, to the mighty Wolf with his almost impenatrable castles and huge armies which will decimate you and your allies if not prepared for them. This game is the living proof you can live on beer and relgion or flowers and graves. If your popularity is down and you don't have food, just build some churches and taverns and lets get drunk with god. It might be a hard game to get at first but after you've played a couple of games and watched some vids you will get it and become better.It doesn't have a main campaign, instead it has several smaller campaign of 5 missions each. next to these missions are the trials in which you must fight every lord with and without allies and with an econimical disadvantage and an ally disadvantage. The game is balanced because everyone has access to the same units. some maps might not be balanced but thats what gives you the challenge.This is downright the best game of the developer. the games following this title aren't as good espacially stronghold 3 which is a turd. If you want hours of gameplay for not to much money, this is your game to play.(tip buy collectors edition from steam in a sale or from a third party site)			",42,0,0,7,14,0,24

												After all those years Stronghold Crusader did not get old. It is entertaining as it was years ago and by getting HD version it looks better on modern PC screens.The most important things I'd like to recommend are: balanced gameplay; interesting and long single player campaign; multiplayer mode; good AI of enemies controlled by computer; great soundtrack; oldschool (but in a positive way!) graphic; user-friendly mechanics. It also runs smooth. I know the game's old, but I remember it was good optimized years ago and now, on modern computers, it still runs well.What else to say? This game is a game of a high quality, definitely. If you haven't played it yet then you should, because Stronghold Crusader is truly one of the best RTS games ever made (at least in my oppinion).

 Game is on sale, should I buy it?  If you like strategy games or stronghold games atall then yes. Easily worth the sale price. Should you buy this game?  Yes!! This was the strategy game of my childhood and still is. The game plays well and has a good economy and combat which means you will always be fighting or be close to action most of the game. (Obvious some exceptions 1v1 on largest map `-`) The game plays the same as the other Stronghold games but has a different food system where you can only have farms on grass. Take note the game is set in the desert. Skirmish mode is where the game shines since the AI is decent in giving you a challenge especially when you are against the odds. Obvious flaws in the AI play style exist but doesn't affect the game at all. I've had hours before buying the steam version and will probally sink some more in when I can. There is a good map variety and a decent amount of AI characters each with 2-3 different set castles they build and each have their own playstyle and unit variety. There isn't a difficulty slider for the AI apart from gold they start. Is there a campaign? No. There is not a set campaign like other strongholds. The missions are just skirmish battles but pre set. There are roughly 30 of these in base game and 30 in expansion which is included in this. (I havn't played or counted all of these so don't hold me to numbers) These get more challenging and make some interesting battles if you get half way through. Is this worth it over the non HD version? Technically no. All this adds is resolution support which makes it run somewhat more smoothly but doesn't actually change much more. Somewhat random review and will be missing alot of points but just wanted to post.			",188,29,10,18,23,1,50

												Dont look at my play time I have played this game for hundreds of hours when i was a kid. This game is...amazing. Truly amazing. There are few words that are able to describe how crazy good this game is. No it does not have the depth of StarCraft, but its not designed to be a competitive game. Its a casual fun strategy, that you can play with you mouse. But dont let that turn you away from the game. There is plenty of challange for hardcore RTS fans like me. You can make the matchups very imbalanced, and there is not just one type of AI, there are 14 diferend adversaries, and no they are not just dificulties, they build their castels diferently, and use diferent types of army. There are historical campaings, but they are very underwhelming IMO.If i have to rate this game it would be a 9/10. If i have to trust the biast nostalgia 17/10 :). But a more realistic verdic would be 9/10. A must own for all self respecting RTS fans.NOW BEGONE FROM HERE GO PLAY THE GAME INFIDELS!			",40,3,0,3,5,0,3

												My first stronghold is a minigame that came along with a game magazine that you controls three arrowmen to fight incoming enemies. Your last resort is a engineer pouring down oil that kills most of enemies down stairs.The minigame acts like a trailer to the upcoming game that brought to my attention, the Stronghold game.It was my eight year old I believe. And it has been over twenty years passed, and now I have repurchased this game on steam. What a great childhood memory, and what a game when I could play both as a child and as an adult. xDCannot say too much. Rating 10/10.P.S. Do not play stronghold 3 as it is nothing comparing to the first one. I haven't played the second one so I will not comment. But the third one is nothing, literally nothing comparing to the first one. I have to repeat myself. Overall, enjoy the game guys, and definitely you shall buy it on this week sale. :)			",403,127,4,35,47,7,72

												This was the first game I ever bought for myself way back in 2002 and I've logged hundreds more hours in it than my steam profile would suggest. This game though over a decade old, is truly still relevant within the same castle building rts genre today and for me is more than just nostalgia. It combines a somewhat historically accurate and entertaining historical campaign following the rough lines of the First, Second and Third Crusades and playable from different sides of the conflicts. The AI can be rather easy to beat if exploited and with experience in beating the various AI lords you need to challenge yourself using the map maker and understanding AI play style to make winning the match a true challenge. I love this game and would recommend it to anyone with a historical inclination and an appreciation of rts games from the early 2000's. Hopefully someday they'll make a sequel worth playing.

												Fun old Castle sim game.  The best in the series to date.  I bought the most recent version of Stronghold, but unfortunatly, they lost the point.  An oldy but a goody.  I have returned to play this game time and time again because I love it so much.  I used to be a huge fan of the Age of Empires series, but this game kicks that game's can down the street.  It is amazing.  If you liked Age of Empires, you will love this game to death.  Just warning you though, it can be a huge challenge though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I dont always write reviews...But when I do, Its for a fantastic game.[Rating at End of review]When I got this game I placed it in a cart with Far cry 3, a game that I was looking forword to playing. After I purchesed this game, I did not play it and it was idle in my library. Then when my friend came over for airsofting, he downloaded the game because he wanted to play it. It was when I was watching him play it that I realized that this game is amazing! One thing I regret doing was tring to play this game like Age of Empires A game that I played when I was young, where you build an empire. In this game you build a castle/stronghold and attack other castle/strongholds. Right now this game holds its place in my favorites catagory in steam along with Space Engineers, Just Cause 2, Elder scrolls Skyrim and Supreme Commander.This game is in my opinion 10/10 for filling the hole of nostalga that Age of Empires could not fill.

												Although, I haven't played this through Steam yet, this game is the greatest Medieval RTS game that there is. Besides the out dated graphics - if you're a veteran RTS player, you have probably played worse - this game is fantastic.This game was the first video game I really got into on the PC. I played countless hours, and if I had to make a guess, I'd say well over 2000+. Since September 2004, this game has stayed within my top 5 because it is simply just that good.I always find myself coming back to this game, year after year, never being dissapointed in the challenge that the computer opponents offer. When I played this game day in day out and finally mastered it, I could beat all 7 wolves on a team on my own. Now I don't play this game as much, but I still find myself going back to it, whenever a friend wants to play. Lets talk about what the game has to offer and compare to other games in it's series. Stronghold Crusader, many will say is the best in the entire series, and I'd have to agree. This game, is way cheaper, and rich with content, than it's sequel, Stronghold Crusader 2. Stronghold Crusader includes many different medieval units that you'd probably expect: Swordsman, Archers, Crossbowman, Knights on Horseback, Spearman, etc. But it includes many more like engineers, pikeman, macemen, horse archers, slaves, fire throwers... There are two types of troops: Arabic, or Crusader troops. Both similiar, yet both with their strengths and weaknesses. Some AI lords will use only Crusader troops, or only Arabic troops, while some will use a mixture of them both,Like I said before the AI can be pretty challenging. Of course, there are very, very stupid AI as well that you could beat no problem if you knew the very basics. But the Wolf, and Saladin are very challenging opponents that can take you hours to beat depending on the style of game you play. The campaign(s) are very challenging to beat and they offer you as little as possible to win...but you do get 3 chickens (passes) and once you beat a level you have already passed on, you get a chicken back. This game can be played with up to 8 players/AI lords. It can be free for all, 1v1, 4v4, 2v2v2v2, 5v3 or any combination of teams you want. Online or offline. Play with friends and players around the world easily on a program called GameRanger. It works well for me and my sister.The gameplay is a lot of fun, and not too complicated to understand. You have peasants that stay idle and are useless unless you provide jobs for them. Once you create say a woodcutters hut using the resources from your stockpile a peasant will walk his way to the hut and become a woodcutter. He will chop down the closest trees and deliver wood to your stockpile. You also need other resources like stone, iron, weapons, and most importantly, food. Without food, your peasants and workers will not want to stay at your castle, so they will leave. Make sure to keep the happiness/popularity above 50. Food, negative taxes, Ale/Inn, and large troop count will all be bonuses to popularity. If your king dies you lose. If all enemy kings are dead, you win :)To train troops, you need to use your resources to build buildings to produce troops. You can go 3 routes: Crusader troops, Arabic troops, or both. Barracks will be required to produce crusader troops. But crusader troops require weapons to be made so you need to make weapon workshops. Arabic troops need a mercenary post and hence the name cost more gold, but they do not require the time, money and resources for workshops to create weapons. Engineers, a more advanced unit, needs an Engineers guild to produce them. They can be helpful by taking castle walls down using catapults.There is also a free build mode, map editor, and custom scenario mode which offer even more fun with tha already addicting campaign, sandbox, and multiplayer modes.I highly recommend this game, and definitely if it is on sale. If you're debating over any other Stronghold game go for this one!10/10			",48,1,1,2,23,0,14

												I was only 5 years old, I loved Stronghold so much. I had all the merchandise and games. I pray to Stronghold everyday thanking it for the life i've been given. ""Stronghold is love"" I say ""Stronghold is life"". My dad hears me and says ""Total War is better"". I knew he was just jealous of my devotion for Stronghold. I called him a filthy peasant. He puts my granary on half rations and sends me to go to sleep. I'm crying now and my peasants are leaving. I lay in bed and its really cold. A warmth is moving towards me. I feel something touch me. Its the scribe, i'm so happy. He whispers in my ear ""A message m'lord"". He grabs me with his powerful scribe hands and puts me on my hands and knees. I'm ready. I open my gates for the scribe and he enters my castle. It hurts so much but I do it for the scribe. I can feel my castle tearing as my eyes start to water. I push against his force, I want to please the scribe. He roars a mighty roar as he fills my stockpile. My dad walks in. The scribe looks him straight in the eye and says ""The stockpile is full m'lord"". The scribe catapults out my window. ""Stronghold is Love, Stronghold is life""			",31,0,0,4,6,0,15

												It was great in 2002, it's still great today. I may be slightly bias due to the fact that this game made up my childhood, but I feel all the positive comments are justified. The simplicity of this game is one of its many charms. Don't let this fool you, there is still plenty to do and this game can be adjusted to match your playstyle. Casual gamer? Try out a custom skirmish game where you make the rules. Looking for a challenge? Why not head to the Crusader Trials? Despite its simplicity, the game can surprise you at times. The AI is pretty impressive (unless you ask them to defend you; they aren't the brightest bulb in the bunch when it comes to that respect), the different strategies you can implement to obtain victory never ceases to amaze me. Forgive my bluntless, but I'm willing to say that this game is one of, if not the best, RTS games to date. I know it's my personal favourite (sorry Total War).			",73,12,0,16,10,0,9

												A classic I loved to play as a kid along with the original. Don't let play hours fool you, I've played the cd version on and off since I first picked it up with my dad at EB games! (yup that long ago, EB games!!) A great and worthy sequel to the orginal!Pros-More awesome voiceovers, in arabic this time!-Good graphics for its time-Skirmish mode addon-New characters-Multiple campaigns-Arabic units-Desert theme-Same old game we love, they didn't ruin it, they didn't fix it either becase they didn't need to, it was perfect in its orignal release!-Historical missionsCons-The campaigns are less personal than the orginal, no big story that is, hearing the villians plot their schemes, or fireplace cutscenes, just some back story on the time and event and a massive campaign that is a string of skirmish missions put together, its still fun to beat though!OverallA game that has and will stand the test. Definitely better than the awful Strongholds 2 and 3. Firefly seriously just needs to go back to its roots and expand upon this game within the 3d engine, not change everything, and have better quality control!  I digress, get the original for its amazing story, and get this for its awesome skirmish mode!10/10      Classic Castle Building Sim			",80,7,0,6,11,1,23

												This is one of my favorite games from my childhood, and it holds up well. The graphics look pretty good and the music is still perfect. The game is as fun as ever and controls well. A great strategy game.If you are expecting the game to have Steam functionality for multiplayer, don't get your hopes up - in order to play on a non-Lan game, you'll need to download an additional program like Hamachi or GameRanger. This is a tad disappointing but doesn't ruin the experience - it just makes multiplayer less convenient.All in all, a great, classic strategy game.			",107,23,1,20,9,0,15

												Imagine a real-time, fast-paced strategy game where you enter the Holy Lands following an unforgiving trail of fifty crusaders – each more difficult than the last; each with different enemies, different resources, different allies and different economies. You discover and master the art of defending and storming castles – planning your every move carefully while controlling armies of men, horses, portable-shields, catapults and more in the hundreds. Now, realize that the game in question, Stronghold Crusader, was released twelve years ago and that a succeeder is inbound Q4 2014.In comparison to the original Stronghold, Firefly Studios significantly altered the dynamics of Stronghold Crusader in an attempt to increase the game speed – which unforgivably means the first few minutes of each mission are crucial. The changes includes the addition of a range of Arabian mercenary units, where especially assassins, fire throwers and horse archers introduces a range of new opportunities upon both defending your own castle and conquering others. The traditional military units are still more powerful however, but takes significantly longer to recruit due to the extensive production line. The player must thus analyze the enemies and starting resources swiftly – the sooner the production line can be started, the better. Similar, if the enemies appear weak during the early stages, a quick and silent attack gently delivered by assassins might be preferred.One aspect is to defend your castle and attack enemies, a whole other layer of gameplay, which appears subtle at first glance, is the actual castle management. Stronghold Crusader introduces a range of buildings and techniques which allows the player to generate more money, extra powerful men or a harder working population, to name a few. Increasing your population’s happiness through religion or ale allows for higher taxes, crowding and even food shortages. Similar, increasing the amount of bad things (i.e. gallows, dunking tools or cesspits) in your castle makes your population work faster and thus generate a faster and more efficient money flow.Securing a food chain is even more important than it was in the original Stronghold due to the deserted and rocky terrain which greatly limits the amount of fertile areas. These areas are therefore both interesting and important strategic points; take out an enemy’s food supply and you force him out of his castle. The gameplay thus consists of both castle management, fighting and survival throughout 50 crusades, four chapters of historically inspired missions and an extra 30 crusades introduced after the original release – in total well above 40 hours of campaign gameplay, excluding later free- and custom-play.The RTS-genre has undeniably advanced significantly since the release of Stronghold Crusader on several fronts; including, but not limited to, the graphics (though, admittedly, the old graphics are charming), the audio, the interfaces and the AI. Especially the latter is easily noticeable if you have played any modern RTS-game – the AI in Stronghold Crusader is easily tricked, and once a player reaches a certain point in the map, winning ultimately becomes a matter of time due to the superior human player and the seemingly flat difficulty-level of the AIs. Instead, the game relies on quantity and starting perks such as six AIs with 20.000 gold each versus the player with only 3.000 gold. That said then the game unfortunately suffers from a range of bugs and glitches, which unavoidably results in quite some micromanagement of the player’s troops to ensure they indeed are doing the assigned task accordingly. The path-finding system has a tendency to chose some strange routes, and can, on rare occasions, end up getting your men stuck. Though, remembering the age of the game then these issues are minor and certainly not game breaking – merely frustrating due to the higher focus on micromanagement.The freedom in terms of building and designing your castle is intriguing and very unique compared to other RTS-games. Similar, the actual gameplay is extremely simple and straightforward, but due to the many layers of extra options and techniques during both fighting and castle management, the gameplay is yet challenging – and most importantly, fun. Ignoring the minor bugs and glitches, Stronghold Crusader is a solid game for any RTS-fan, and a great option for those who wishes to enter the genre!			",494,167,14,58,38,3,79

												Exactly like the classic we all know and love.The game remains as the classic once was, the crusader trail and the historical campaigns are all included. Even warchest is included, alltogether making this a purchase worth well worth it.What I would've liked to see in this revision?- Could've used some rebalancing;- Could've used some bugfixing;- Could've used a solid multiplayer component, built in the game (or via steam, for that matter).My verdict?Well worth your time, and double the fun if you have friends that play the game too. Plenty of hours of fun to be had, as you can renew challenges for yourself (and your friends) with the map editor!			",116,37,2,41,38,0,49

												Imagine a real-time, fast-paced strategy game where you enter the Holy Lands following an unforgiving trail of fifty crusaders – each more difficult than the last; each with different enemies, different resources, different allies and different economies. You discover and master the art of defending and storming castles – planning your every move carefully while controlling armies of men, horses, portable-shields, catapults and more in the hundreds. Now, realize that the game in question, Stronghold Crusader, was released twelve years ago and that a succeeder is inbound Q4 2014.In comparison to the original Stronghold, Firefly Studios significantly altered the dynamics of Stronghold Crusader in an attempt to increase the game speed – which unforgivably means the first few minutes of each mission are crucial. The changes includes the addition of a range of Arabian mercenary units, where especially assassins, fire throwers and horse archers introduces a range of new opportunities upon both defending your own castle and conquering others. The traditional military units are still more powerful however, but takes significantly longer to recruit due to the extensive production line. The player must thus analyze the enemies and starting resources swiftly – the sooner the production line can be started, the better. Similar, if the enemies appear weak during the early stages, a quick and silent attack gently delivered by assassins might be preferred.One aspect is to defend your castle and attack enemies, a whole other layer of gameplay, which appears subtle at first glance, is the actual castle management. Stronghold Crusader introduces a range of buildings and techniques which allows the player to generate more money, extra powerful men or a harder working population, to name a few. Increasing your population’s happiness through religion or ale allows for higher taxes, crowding and even food shortages. Similar, increasing the amount of bad things (i.e. gallows, dunking tools or cesspits) in your castle makes your population work faster and thus generate a faster and more efficient money flow.Securing a food chain is even more important than it was in the original Stronghold due to the deserted and rocky terrain which greatly limits the amount of fertile areas. These areas are therefore both interesting and important strategic points; take out an enemy’s food supply and you force him out of his castle. The gameplay thus consists of both castle management, fighting and survival throughout 50 crusades, four chapters of historically inspired missions and an extra 30 crusades introduced after the original release – in total well above 40 hours of campaign gameplay, excluding later free- and custom-play.The RTS-genre has undeniably advanced significantly since the release of Stronghold Crusader on several fronts; including, but not limited to, the graphics (though, admittedly, the old graphics are charming), the audio, the interfaces and the AI. Especially the latter is easily noticeable if you have played any modern RTS-game – the AI in Stronghold Crusader is easily tricked, and once a player reaches a certain point in the map, winning ultimately becomes a matter of time due to the superior human player and the seemingly flat difficulty-level of the AIs. Instead, the game relies on quantity and starting perks such as six AIs with 20.000 gold each versus the player with only 3.000 gold. That said then the game unfortunately suffers from a range of bugs and glitches, which unavoidably results in quite some micromanagement of the player’s troops to ensure they indeed are doing the assigned task accordingly. The path-finding system has a tendency to chose some strange routes, and can, on rare occasions, end up getting your men stuck. Though, remembering the age of the game then these issues are minor and certainly not game breaking – merely frustrating due to the higher focus on micromanagement.The freedom in terms of building and designing your castle is intriguing and very unique compared to other RTS-games. Similar, the actual gameplay is extremely simple and straightforward, but due to the many layers of extra options and techniques during both fighting and castle management, the gameplay is yet challenging – and most importantly, fun. Ignoring the minor bugs and glitches, Stronghold Crusader is a solid game for any RTS-fan, and a great option for those who wishes to enter the genre!			",494,167,14,58,38,3,79

												Great game, really. It's like turning to old times 12 years ago when I had very slow pc, and only Stronghold runned without any performance issues. Can't say that the storyline is intereting, but the gameplay process is making you completely dive in. Enemies are good, but unfortunately too weak and you easily pick up one strategy and use it throughout entire game, until you complete all the missions. Also in the field did occur several bugs, when AI had been building up a castle, and then struck in place, just trading and doing nothing else. Building proces can be simplified using the change of game speed, which at start may give you great advantage in relation to your enemies / allies. About multiplayer: never played, but going to, I think, then will update review.Conclusion: just great, spent many hours with pleasure.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This review is not intended to address the original Stronghold Crusader, which is absolutely fantastic, but rather the HD version specifically.Also, Steam says I have almost no time on this at all. This is because I had to play it on Game Ranger and Steam did not record that time as playtime. I also put probably hundreds of hours into it before I bought it here.I have owned Stronghold Crusader for my entire adult life, and it was always one of my favorite games. When I saw that there was an HD version out, I immediately put it on my wishlist and eventually wound up owning it. Now, I have not taken seriously the idea that HD games are any better graphically than their original versions. I've played a few HD games and even in side by side pictures I have a hard time telling the difference. The main point to HD games, as far as I can tell, is that they are more playable on modern machines.While this game does technically run, it does so with difficulty. Generally windows behind the game bleed through somehow and cause disruption. Alt tabbing is possible but only with great disruption and it takes a good five to ten seconds to get back into the game. One nice thing about buying an old game on Steam is that you can usually have the Steam overlay and multiplayer with other steam users is quite easy. This game has no Steam overylay and multiplayer is actually extremely difficult. It took probably half an hour for two professional geeks to figure it out. That had a lot to do with us avoiding Game Ranger at all costs, but we couldn't find any other way to play it multiplayer. GameR anger it is.Now, I already owned this game. I have it on a compact disc downstairs. I got this game here because I thought it was something beyond the version from my late teens and would have some sort of advantage over that.Don't get me wrong. If you don't already own this game, do buy it. But not on Steam. Get it on Gog where you won't have all the drm. If you already own Stronghold Crusader, the HD version brings nothing new of any value.Again, I can't speak highly enough of Stronghold Crusader itself, but you don't need the HD version and you get none of the regular Steam advantages by buying it here.

												What's that? No 3D-graphics? Well, guess what... It doesn't need that to be good!Here you are, starting only with some wood, stone and gold. You build - you recruit - you fight - you win (?). It's a simple concept and a lot of strategy games follow this direction. In fact, Stronghold Crusader isn't really complex, so the first sight might give you the impression of a boring city simulator... For me, there's something wonderful about this simplicity.The goal is to be the very best like no one ever was. Kill the enemy's king and get your well-earned peace while you defend your own crown-wearing buddy. Of course they won't invite you into their castle, so you have to invite yourself. In order to blast away their walls and towers, there are different ways, like hammering every single brick off the wall or dig a tunnel underneath it. They won't like you to be that rude, so they put archers on towers to keep your men away and you'll have to get rid of them first somehow! Either you ruin the towers with catapults or invade with own archers and fight back.This isn't what makes Stronghold Crusader so enjoyable. The true entertainment is the possibility to be a rotten ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to them! Every inhabitant of the castle is a free-walking NPC which can be killed too. It is incredibly annoying when your enemy has posted some archers beneath your farms and keeps killing your farmers. Not only is it very time consuming to fight off those archers, but it's also very stressful for the castle's economy. Every killed farmer means a lost delivery of food, and without food your people will get very angry. Your people start to leave your castle when you keep being such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and soon you will only have three peasants left.If this is still too weak for you, you can step it up and use dirty tricks to wreck'em! If you manage to lit an enemy's building on fire, it will spread out drasticly, burning down every house 'n' human. This could lead to a total destruction of the castle, making them to start from the beginning. Fire is a great element of the game, because it can turn a lost-believed battle into a success.Otherwise I'd say it's a classic RTS. Build, fight and succeed. There are  singleplayer campaigns, but the true enjoyment is the multiplayer with friends, because of the nasty actions possible. Sadly you'll have to fiddle around with IPs and networks in order to connect to each other. Because this game doesn't require alot performance, the connection is always stable (at least for me it always was) and free of laggs. All I can say is that I've played this game for whole days years ago and I still enjoy this piece. The graphics may look very old and bad, but I think it only adds to the charisma the game shows.

												One of my favourite strategy games of all time. I played every Stronghold game they released and Stronghold Crusader is by far the best. It's an old game I can't deny that, but in my opinion the 2D graphics look more attractive than any other 3D from the other Stronghold Games. The only negative thing I can think of is that it's sometimes a little bit hard to handle, because there is no autosell/ autobuy option on the market. But All in All it is my favourite Stronghold game and maxbe the last good game they made			",123,23,4,21,31,0,20

												This game is fantastic. It's been a longtime favorite of mine and has never left me bored, even after years of playing it. The detail at which you control your economy and army is perfect, and all goes together splendidly.Always recommended to get this for people who love real time strategy games.			",14,0,0,4,9,0,10

												Stronghold Crusader was a game I had played hundreds of hours of as a child. I remember playing it on an old windows 2000 machine. Like its predecessor Stronghold it is one of the best medieval strategy games on the market, and was revolutionary for its time. The game mechanics though older are superb and the campaign is worth playing through every scenario. Don't feel like fighting? Simply build a castle peacefully, and keep your people happy. The dynamicsOf the game rival most modern day strategy games. I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone who has played stronghold crusader before, and also to gamers looking for a well paced classic real time strategy game with a community that is still thriving to this day. I would definitely give it at the very least an 8/10 ifNot in my personal opinion a 10 out of 10.			",106,9,1,9,26,0,28

												A game many played when they were younger and brings back memories, an RTS that has deep strategy which this game made even better through the desert setting and scarcer resources, and topped off by the fact that it's an RTS where I dont feel limited by my APM at all, and instead it's how I play the game rather than how fast I play it that merits reward. Truly a gem among RTS's especially for lower skilled players, and also functions as a great castle sim for those not interested in fighting opponents.

												This game is the GREATEST castle sim of all time. I started playing it long before steam was even a thing, and have loved it every minute since. This game offers several gamemodes, which with out just one, or one of them is even slightly altered, this game would be very different. The graphics are not the greatest, being created in the early 2000's, but that is beside the point. Some of the gamemodes include: Castle Building(Very Peaceful), Two Campaign trails(Begins Easy, becomes harder down the trail), Your 'average joe' multiplayer(Play against AI or even Players *Hard to play with other players)  You can create maps for multiplayer. You can 'relive' several great battles of the crusade. Many different types of units. If you buy this game, you receive Stronghold Crusader Extreme, which increases the amount of units, more AI, more campaign trails, and even more replay value. If you have not bought, you SHOULD buy it rightnow. I recommend this game, with a rating of 9.7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you have played this game and liked it, you will probably agree that this game is just a ""QUIIIICK MARCH"" away from becomming one of the most celebrated castle builders of the early 2000's.If you haven't tried it: I highly recommend this game for anyone who wants to get into the Stronghold franchise since it's the last game before the unnecessary micromanaging started, making you responsible for your citizens crap being placed in a pile rather than right in front of their door(I'm not kidding).Finally, if you have tried it didn't like it(or hated it), why did you bother reading this review?

												Stronghold Crusader is a castle building simulator that combines warfare,economy and siege mecahnics .While original game had more focus on single player experiance this game replaces story telling with skirmish campaign .Overall this is improvment on the Stronghold 1 . It has new units,walls,characters and more responsive gameplay.Despite not having story this game is held up by the charismatic Lords whom you will fight through 50 crusader missions .One really cool thing about this game is the AI players . For artifical players they sure build interesting castles and can be pretty nasty opponents on hard diffeculty .Its near a perfect game which I consider a classic . ",266,102,5,39,11,1,38

												I had played this years ago and had hit a wall IIRC, where one of the levels I kept losing to and gave up.  So it can be challenging.It can also be a little grindy if you haven't gone through the tutorial (me) and figured out all the different units and maybe some more combined arms strategy.  ==It gets very grindy.==Basically this is Age of Empires or others from that RTS genre and timeframe, but this emphasizes the happiness mechanic by allowing bribing or taxing the people and feeding or starving them, along with other buildings that might affect happiness or fear and productivity.  Of couse once you understand the new mechanic, it's not too interesting - it translates into more buttons to push and wanting some manager to handle all that - but this is an old game.  They hadn't invented managers yet.Note: A key difference from Age of Empires is that in Stronghold, if you have enough resources for <whatever>, purchasing that creates it _instantaneously_.  There's no wait for units to churn out or buildings to build - they are there the moment you click the build button.I'm on the 6th or so level in the campain, and I have yet to build a decent ""castle-looking"" castle.  It all becomes more like a tower defense game in that regard.Voice acting is excellent, though not too varied.  There's some nice cuteness there I really like the archers and the when the knight complains if you ask him to walk all over the continent!  Hahaha :)ALSO nice surprise was the inclusion of a Stronghold Crusader ""Extreme"" add-on, which I'd never heard of until I downloaded the game.  It's apparently a set of new scenarios.

Its a city building game that also envolves destroying the other opponet(s), If you do not like RTS, there is a gamemode on this game that allows you to create your own city with the only obsticle is wildlife wich is not a big deal. There are many things to do in this game and many ways to think your plans through, and with a level ediot you can think your strategy out in so many different ways!			",154,15,2,20,14,0,11

												I grew up playing this game. From the time I was 6, I was already done with the Historical Campaign and the Crusader Missions. But then, around when I was 10, I let my friend borrow it. This was a mistake. He lost it less than a day after I gave it to him. I was so disappointed. I checked Wal-Marts, GameStop... I wanted that game back so badly! I was so desperate ot find a way to get it back. Then, it hit me; Steam is a place for (almost) all games! I searched up, ""Stronghold Crusader"" and was shocked to find out there was even more Crusaders  to be offered! I got a $20 Steam Card and purchased 2 Stronghold Crusader games. I got one for my self, and the other for my friend, Ethan. We enjoy playing it!			",75,15,1,16,13,0,1

												""Wood needed""""Not enough wood m'lord""""Wood stocks are too low sire""""Stone needed""*Me* SHUT UP!! D:<Real review time! :PThis game is fun on so many levels, yet at sometimes it can be a little tedious with the AI.I played it years ago with the demo (It was one of my top played games besides Stronghold 2 demo wise) and still enjoy playing it.The playing time is endless because there are so many options to win, like my favorite, catapault and archer rush :PFeel the power of a thousand arrows!!ProsSoo much time  waisted.... (I have over 1k hours in the demo probably XD if only steam would show it)Your life waisted playing this game for it being addicting.Your friends won't be seeing you much anymore.Your wife won't be seeing you much anymore.Your social skills will die.Life as you know it will involve these things things, Eating, Stronghold Crusader, Drinking, Stronghold Crusader, Sleeping, Stronghold Crusader, Going to the bathroom, Stronghold Crusader, Going back to sleep, Stronghold Crusader.No cons present. To leave you with the satisfaction of something being here i give you. Caliph..The Scorpion!

												Stronghold Crusader had the best gameplay in the entire series, but the graphics were getting a little bit outdated after a decade. This HD re-release makes it look good enough to last another decade. Don't expect fancy 3D graphics, this is old-school isometric 2.5D.The gameplay is solid. There are tutorials to teach you the basics and there are two ""crusader trails"" with about 50 missions each to give you a lot of different scenarios to play through. There are also campaigns with a story to them. You play as a lord in the time of the crusades. You start with a small manor and a hand full of troops and there are enemies who want you dead. Build farms to grow food to keep your population alive. Gather resources such as wood, stone and metal. Build up a castle wall-by-wall according to your own design. Put down towers of different shapes and sizes: small tall towers to give your archers extra range, and big lower towers on which you can mount siege weapons. Have your population craft weapons to train soldiers or hire mercenaries with gold. Then try to invade your enemies' castles. Build catapults to destroy their walls, or use siege ladders to get your archers on their walls to turn their safe castle into a slaughterhouse. Beware of hidden traps like spike pits and burning oil.Skirmish mode allows you to pick from a few dozen maps, some balanced and some unbalanced. Want to play 4 vs 4 on a balanced map? Want a real challenge, then pick an unbalanced map and stack the odds against you. The AI does not have traditional difficulty levels, but there are a number of AI personalities that have their own strategy. Fighting against the Caliph means you have to be prepared dirty tricks like waves of slaves trying to burn down your farms, and fire arrow archers trying to set the ground on fire when you try to take his castle. King Richard attacks with honor and superior force using siege weapons and heavily armored units. The Sultan is a dreamer who focuses more on building an economy than training a superior army. The Snake thows large numbers of archers and spearmen at you, favoring quantity over quality.			",201,33,2,69,72,3,77

												A classic RTS game that me and my brother loved to death. Build castles and a small town and armies and send them on a march to their death and glory to conquer the other enemies, you can create everything from small fire-starters (peasants) to templars and engineer equipment to tear down walls as well as assassin's (they look like ninja's and use hooks to grapple the walls, I would always use dozens of these to get over the wall and kill their king, lol).

												I have been playing Stronghold Crusader since it´s been released and i am always coming back. This game is brilliant, there is incredible amount of thought in this game, you can play for years and always discover new strategies, new tactics...But for those who are about to decide whether or not to buy it, i say - just do it.

												This game is one of my all time favorites. The music was so well made and beautiful that have them in my song library. I have 200+ hours in this one and its not just because im a die-hard fan (though i am), there are 95+ missions in game with a good amount of AI with varying difficulty. Also includes a map editor for you to make your own maps and seige missions. If new to stronghold, it has a realistic economic system for your castle to thrive (ex.- need crossbow men? frist you need a cow farm, then a tanner who takes the cows for the hide armor, then you need the crossbow its self to be made from a flecher and both craftables placed in the armory). This game is an absolute gem. 10/10			",44,0,0,11,8,0,13

												After completing Stronghold Crusader, I purchased Stronghold Crusader 2 but have been quite dissapointed with the gameplay. FireFly studios have tried their best to appeal to the die hard fans of the series as well as use graphics to appeal to new customers... hence why I ended up coming back and Purchasing the HD edition of the original as this way I get an extra 30 missions to play for a small price which I would reccomend for any fan of the series.

												Easily my favorite childhood game and I cannot wait until the second one comes out. You can easily spend 500+ hours in this game as every game is different. There are a ton of maps varrying from 2 to 8 players. There is about 10 enemies that you can change the difficulty of. You can change how the teams work. its possible to make it 7 friendlies verse one baddy or 7 baddies against you.If you love strategy games, this is a must have!			",85,6,0,7,17,1,7

												First off, the game is great. There's no denying that. But is this version worth buying? It requires third party software to be played online, it's not compatible with the steam overlay, it's basically the same thing you might get from GOG, except it automatically installs gameranger without even letting you choose any of the options.Both GOG and steam are the same version, except one has to be downloaded through a client, and the other only uses an un-intrusive installer. Get the GOG, or hell, even pirate it, and you'll get the same thing. Basically don't expect anything re-vamped like in other HD remakes, all you get is the possibility of running the same old game at with a higher resolutions.It's your choice if you want to buy it on steam either way, but I'd recommend to try elsewhere.

												Alright! Much better than the Stronghold HD which I consider totally awful for it's terrible graphics. Despite Crusader HD being not much different at the first look, this one has much nicer graphics which gives a reason enough to stay a little longer and actually learn to play some, a little obscure user interface still being a slight problem. It'd be nice that basic management tools for user interface would be more obvious for those less frequent players of the game, like the management of the game view and the required actions from player would be nice to have in text on screen in the early stages and optionally even later on. SimCity 4 is the best example of a game from this era that guides a novice through the tutorials to give a good head start to the game and keeps palyer in its thight grip further the game continues. Will likely give Crusader a proper chance at some point.Addendum: the Stonghold Crusader Extreme HD side product didn't seem as interesting as I was looking for just a builder game. It too has a building side to it, but the game itself is intended for more action driven multiplayer sessions. Also the map builder had some glitchy graphics to it that I found alienating which I didn't recognise in the main game. Have I bought SCE HD alone would have been much disappointed, but now it just takes a little extra space on my disk unless I decide to doze it. Do you still find active servers for this old game, beats me, but if you're into that kind of stuff you'll probably seek company to make it happen.			",2,2,17,1,6,0,0

												If you love this series already, go for it. The HD version makes those old graphics truly enjoyable to play on modern screens, and you already know the rest. My lack of recommendation comes from the perspective of someone who enjoys old RTS games, but had never played anything in this series. Stronghold Crusader has great concepts such as the economy and popularity systems. I'm guessing those features, innovative for their time and still rare in later games, are among the reasons this game garnered such a huge following. However, the UI and combat are stuck in the mid-90s era of clunkiness and extreme simplicity, and I for one simply can't get past those shortcomings.			",52,3,0,16,7,0,22

												As much as I want to love this game, especially as someone who used to play the old Stronghold Crusader during my childhood for a long time, I can't ignore the issues I have with this game:- a screen which continously flickers anything else I have openend at the same time that isn't minimized- the old ui, without any upscaling to modern resolutions, making everything super small, the minimap uttterly useless and some really loveless added bar on the side of the buildings menu, which pointlessly obstructs the view and feels utterly pointless- I can NOT tab out. If I try and try to tab back into the game it won't open again and I need to close it and start anewThat being said I still enjoy playing it, but those issues are very annoying and while I bought thise game during the summer sale for 2 € I still feel ripped off.

												This game will not work with Windows 8! You will be directed by Steam to Firefly to resolve the issue, and their suggestion of running it in compatibility mode will not work. When you ask them for a refund, they will tell you to ask Steam. STEAM WILL NOT HELP YOU IN ANY WAY WITH THIS! Your email to their support system will not even go through! They hide behind a PO Box, good luck with that. I was so disappointed that the game wouldn't work, but I was even more disappointed with Steam's lack of a resolution. Honestly, for a tech company to not have a support email, disgraceful.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Back in its days, it used to be a good game; good fun, smart games - the Stronghold series marked an important step in the evolution of the genre. Take it from someone who is old enough to have played the first Stronghold back when it was published.However, what I'm asked to review here is not the Crusader that came out many years ago; it is instead the HD Steam version.If you already own the original game, this won't offer you anything more.If you have never played it before, you might not appreciate it, because time has not been kind to it, and the HD title is quite misguiding: while it may be true that the game will start on a widescreen and on high resolutions without making your PC explode, it is also true that once you are playing it, the difference in definition from the original is basically non-existant.Considering that it is a milestone and it comes really cheap, especially on sale, it might be worth giving a try; however, history never turns back, and you will never appreciate it as much as you would have back when it was brand new.

												I bought this game expecting endless fun with friends. unfortunately this game has very bad multiplayer you have to download gameranger and when you actually get in a game after endless errors like ""waiting for host"" if one of you has worse internet than usuall the game laggs for everybody. This is primarily a problem from the side of developers. They are just lazy to make multiplayer through steam. If you want to play singleplayer definitetly recomended. but when you want to play with friends and have bad internet: well, no.			",28,5,0,0,5,0,4

												When I purchased Stronghold HD, Stronghold Crusader HD came bundled with it and since I loved the original (my review of Stronghold HD can be found here), I had high hopes of it. The original was a great and unique combination of a castle/city builder and siege-simulator and this game is no different, basically the same game all over again, except that it's not that great anymore. The game feels like an expansion to the original game and not a sequel, mostly because it uses shamelessly everything from Stronghold HD, which wouldn't necessarily be a problem, but it remains inferior to the original in almost every aspect. The milieu is the (not so) vast deserts of the Middle East in the Holy Land mostly during the Third Crusade. The so called historical campaigns are separated from each other and seem rather inconsistent, so there's hardly a plot which makes the single player game unsatisfying. The skirmish missions are even less entertaining, so those don't help the game either. There's also an expansion called Stronghold Crusader Extreme HD, which is super disappointing and all it does that it allows the player to set custom games (which we can do in the main game as well) under extreme conditions and fight multiple opponents at the same time who tend to start with more resources than us... I managed to beat 2 at the same time, but it was a very poor experience, reminding me of old-school 'real-time strategy' games that functioned like meat grinders, where you train more and more troops and just unleash them on your enemies. Some 'strategy'...The main difference between the original game and this one is mainly the environment: instead of the beautiful English forestry, we get to play in deserts. It makes the game harder because now anything can catch fire and that introduces the only (!) new building (the other new one is basically a tent): the well. Yes, we can only put out the randomly appearing fires using wells (or instead of several small ones just one big well). Of course the wells also require workforce, so it is vital to have a few extra peasants. Naturally wells can't prevent the occurrence of fires, so the building on fire is going to take damage and if it's the armoury full of weapons... well, we're in trouble. The other factor is the oasis, which is the only suitable area we can build food production buildings on and needless to say, their size is quite limited. At least the oasis makes the game harder in a good way (requiring careful planning), as opposed to the random fire occurrences.In a few missions we can play the Muslim side, but these are commando missions (can't train units, have to make do with the given ones) only, so we can forget about larger sieges, the main strength of Stronghold. Of course there is sense in the Muslims having no buildings: they should look different than the ones the crusaders have... By the way the crusaders do have Middle-Eastern looking buildings which is a bit strange, but at this point it's really just one of the smaller problems.There are Arabian soldiers, mercenaries we can hire from the previously mentioned tents, for gold (instead of resources). This is an interesting formula as it can speed up the process of training quite a bit, but again, it can turn the game into grindfests at the expense of sieges. The new soldiers are fun (the slingers are fast and cheap but are weak and can attack at short range, the horse archers have great range and are very fast, but expensive and not as accurate as the normal archers), but they are mostly reused versions of the already existing units with readjusted strengths, except slaves (super cheap and weak units who can set buildings on fire) and the assassins (can climb walls and open castle gates). The assassin does have potential and can make a siege more interesting and a bit easier for the attacker. There's also a new fire ballista, a perfect tool for decimating defending archers on towers and it's also a welcome addtion to the attacking side.Some issues that were in the original are also present here: the transparency of the buildings is still a problem when rotating the map and trying to rebuild certain sections of the castle wall and the lack of hotkeys is fatal in the fast paced matches when trying to vanquish multiple opponents. The voices of the peasants are still provided by the same person, which was fun at frist, in Stronghold HD, but this time it's obviously budget related.Stronghold Crusader HD is obviously a letdown, not mainly because it feels like an expansion, but because it seems like a rather cheap duplicate of the great original. The new setting with all its accessories is a setback and the developer must have also felt the absence of the evil characters of the first game, because in the last mission we can meet them again (don't ask).You might think, ""what is this guy talking about, this game isn't that bad"" and you might be right, but if you played the original (and you really should have) you'll see how bad it is in comparison.Accordingly I can't recommend Stronghold Crusader HD to anyone: not to newcomers and especially not to fans of the original. If you want to experience a good siege just load up Stronghold HD again. PROS+ some useful additions and readjustments to the game+ last mission is challengingCONS- less emphasis on castle sieges- issues from the original are still present- campaign is not as enjoyable as the one in the original- feels like an expansion rather than a sequel- cheap ways to make the game harderRATING3/10			",88,73,0,10,4,0,8

												This game....! So many memories and hours spent on it, playing it since I was a kid! SO MANY LAN GAMES....and raging over friends and making new friends over this game, the memories! Memories aside, this game is awesome and it gives you endless fun, literally endless, well the only con in Single Player is when you learn each characters building styles you can easily defeat them, but online......online is a slaughter. One thing you should note is I dont play strategies, especially new ones the only strategies I ever played/play are Stronghold Crusader and Red Alert 2 and I JUST found out that SC is on Steam.....JUST NOW! Dont bother with Stronghold Crusader 2 tho, since its not even close to this. Just enjoy this masterpiece of the game..			",148,16,7,26,11,2,15

												Though i have little hours on steam with this game i have played 100 hours of this game outside steam.Stronghold Crusader is a magnificent game as you have probably read from the other reviews. However, there is some key aspects to the game as in some game changing exploits that need to be made clear. Before you buy this game intending to pummel some people online into the ground i have come across a few exploits that unfortunately break the game.EXPLOITS ~~~ The exploits I'm about to talk about refer to the ""sleep"" mode given at every work space that your workers use. This sleep or making your workers redundant mode can be clicked with excessive speed. if you turn it on then off, the redundant mode (which is suppose to make your workers turn into peasants again) will pause your workers for a second then continue working, whilst more peasants turn into more workers which creates two workers for every one work space in stead of just one worker. this is known and duplicating your workers. this basically doubles your production rate which basically doubles your power. GG easy. (this was hard to explain)The second and most destructive (maybe not an exploit) ""way of thinking"" is to do with the redundant mode again. (making your workers turn back into peasants). After vsing someone online that i saw do this to me (and after commending him with his efforts after he butt♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me like a mad man) you are able to mass create an army using work spaces that require many peasants such as 'mills'. These mills hold 3 boys that take wheat and turn them into flour bags. But if you make 30 mills or so, over time your peasants will turn into these boys until all mills have work. Congratulations now hit the redundant button and gain your self 90 peasants instantaneously +24 peasants max cap at the castle. now i simply create 114 men then simple turn back off the redundant mode and start creating more boys for the mills. This way of working basically is a work around the max cap of 24 peasants at your castle, by simply turning your peasants into workers (for more holding space) then turning them back into peasants for mass production.After seeing my enemy have 500 horse archers and 35 catapults within 20 minutes of the game i could not get even close with anyone as 35 flying rocks also kills an army very fast let alone walls.Depressing as this was this is the reason why mills are so expensive in Stronghold Crusader 2 which is am SO THANKFUL FOR.Stronghold crusader is a great game but there is a glitich or two or a clever way of thinking that over powers the rest.I just want everyone to realise that this game has its issues that wont be fixed as the game is old but b4 you buy try to to cheat plz..... my butt is still sore. (multiplayer uses external program called 'game ranger' that is automatically installed - steam servers are not used)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In Lieu of Crusader 2 coming out, I found this, I also had the GOG version, but this actually allows you to scale it to your monitor's native resolution (so no black bars from the old 4:3 aspect ratio.)There is a bug when it saves, and it seems the AI ""Hordes"" troops (you can't see them since they're all overlapped in a corner) which is something that never was done in the original game.All in all, this is something I'd also like to see the modding community get into, some refreshing texture and sprite polishing would give this oldie and goldie a facelift.For network play with friends, I recommend using Logmein Hamachi until they release a workaround so you can invite Steam users like in AOE 2 HD. All in all, great to re-live this classic, just hope they release it for modding.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The year is 1100 AD, and I'm a noble knight fighting my way across the Holy Lands. Although, I myself can't take on my foes alone, and all I brought with me into the desert are a couple loyal peasents, a handful of bricks, and some coins. What do I do? I build a castle, that's what. Stronghold Crusader HD is an old school RTS that focuses mainly on building and maintaining a thriving castle of your very own, and then using said castle and whoever is inside to crush your opponents. It's pretty much Age of Empires meets Total War, which is a combination that I never though could be possible. If you like strategy games but wish there was more of a creative aspect to your base-building and resource-gathering, then this is well worth your gold pieces.			",155,5,4,11,7,0,14

												Essentially a tower defence game and still one of the best tower defence/strategy game you will ever play! Resource management, defence management, offensive tactics got it all rapped in lovely medieval package. AI is quite challenging as well.Upsides: Castles with moats,  gate houses with drawbridges, clever system of building units need a fletcher to make a bow/crossbow but first you need wood then you need cows for the tanner to slaughter to get the leather armour for your crossbow men interlinking economy very clever. (The little things that new strategy games dont do anymore)Did I mention Castles which you build from scratch and a pop cap of 1000 was insanity but 10K COME ON BUY IT!Downsides: If your a flid at Strategy in real life don't bother this game it will tear you a new one.

												Ah, Stronghold Crusader. I remember this game when I was maybe......6?This game really brings back memories with the floppy disk games.Anyway lets review!Note: Buying the game will also include Stronghold Crusader Extreme but that is so terrible so I wont review it.THE GAMEStronghold Crusader HD is a castle sim with I think 4 modes.Career/Story: Really just a set of tutorials and starting battles to get you ready to play the all grand skirmish mode(I think thats what its called) but never the less it can be fun but only sometimes.Skirmish/Battle: This is probably what makes this game grand. It puts you in a screen where you decide things like the map, how many players fight, where they fight, difficulty, starting money, etc. Then you start building a castle and an army to help you crush the other players while not getting recked yourself. THIS IS WHAT YOU GET THE GAME FOR. I bet it would be fun in MP but none of my friends have it :(Castle Builder- Just the mode if you want to build a huge castle, no enemies just you, your people, and that annoying flippin guide. (WHY?)Multiplayer- If someone wants to add me to play this mode please do ;_;AUDIOThe game has solid voice acting from every character and they talk to you at the right times sometimes indicating how you should prepare, like telling you ""youre kingdom will get crushed"" could indicating that they're lanuching an assault at you. The fighting audio is good but the people getting hit by arrows sounds like there coughing and screaming. Your castle based on how many people actually work it gets more or less chattery and theres less sounds of nature. The only REALLY bad voice acting is your guide, he doesnt change his accent when you change to like a british guy and his voice is just annoying but funny to abuse sometimes. Audio-8/10GAMEPLAYWell as I explained in the modes section you are usually fighting other players, but most of the time youre trying to get people in your kingdom and keep them in your kingdom by maintaning food, taxes, and atractions for your people (like a dancing bear strapped to a pole wtf). Gameplay 9/10STORYLINEI really dont think i should rate this but I will. The game yes has a story mode but it's mostly a tutorial with basic battles. The games story really comes mostly from the gameplay. Think of games like dota 2, CSGO, and TF2 mostly the story comes out of what you do and see, not whats told. Storyline 7/10GraphicsThe graphics would obvioulsy be outdated for a game as old as this but you can see whats going on and not feel like you cant see what that means or indicates. Pretty solid graphics if you look at its age. Im gonna count the score as if I was rating this in the year this was released. Graphics 10/10AI  Since this is what most people have to play with ill make a section for it. As I stated in audio the AI will give you hints about whats about to happen but it might not always happen, making them pretty clever enemies. Each king has a different tactic. Some  build the castle a lot others go and start buiding an army, and some also try to build up they're economy so they could buy troops late game. But each kind changes his tactic depending on what he sees so the AI is different every time.  It could use polishing sometimes though. AI 9/10REPLAYABILITYAs I just said the AI's tactic always changes so you never have the same game twice. Also there are TONS of different maps. By tons I mean like 30 maps each ranging on how many maximum players there can be and I think you are able to get more maps (IDK though). Replayability 10/10VERDICTStronghold Crusader's 10$ price tag is well worth it for such and old and polished game like this.FINAL RATING: 8.6/10 ",233,31,0,33,33,0,11

												This has been a long time coming. SC is one game I have loved from day one. For the first time I played a game that was so complicated it took me a few days to master the economy. I had dreamed of a game like this since I played Warcraft as a small child. A game so realistic you actually had to gather raw materials it was a dream come true. Games have come and gone but SC always remained it was the only game that continued to hold my interest through the years. Even my friends got hooked and my wife who is by no means a gamer. The graphics were subpar even for the time but the gameplay was so entertaining it didn't matter. The attention to detail was beyond compare the concept of citizens you could not control was genius. Every building was bustling with people doing work and sounds of every trade rang out in a crowded village square. I developed many working strategies over the years it was as if there really were no rules. You were limited only by what crazy attack you could think up and how well you executed it. But it wasn't just the gameplay that was exceptional the programming was amazing. The 2D drawing of 3D objects made the game tiny and playable on the oldest computers. I used to carry a copy in my mp3 player so I could play anywhere. It worked on any network without any errors ever seriously in 12 years! I swear this game would run over two tin cans on a string. At some LAN parties we didn't even bother setting up a network we just plugged all the computers into a hub and SC would work even when windows didn't show any other network locations. I still play my original copy and have only encountered a few glitches. I wish they would just remake this game with top of the line graphics. I'll be playing this game till the day I die -SEF			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Stronghold Crusader mixes castle building, RTS, and resource management. The campaign will teach you most of the things from resource gathering, building and defending your castle, to sieging the enemy and defending your castle. Stronghold Crusader has 16 AI lords, each lord has different strategies and difficulties. They also have a different castle builds and troop choices. You can choose to use Arab or European troops or even all together. The extreme edition is a faster paced version of the game that you can play separately from the original game.Stronghold Crusader is one of my favorite RTS games. It is very similar to its predecessor, Stronghold, but it has more content than Stronghold. I first played it since 2007 and bought the steam version recently. It was one of the best and most addicting game I played back then. The game is quite simple when you get the hang of it. The gameplay is still great till this day, even though the game was from 2001. And I really like the HD addition to the game, the max resolution used to be 1024x768 and after the HD addition you can play with almost any resolution. The AI is also quite challenging. The skirmish mode and custom games will add many hours to the game. The soundtrack for Stronghold Crusader is fantastic. I really like the soundtrack of this game. The voice acting is kinda bad, but it really fits with the game somehow. I really like how Arabian units speak Arabic. The integration with Steam Cloud is one of the reasons I bought the Steam version of the game.However, Stronghold Crusader has a minor flaw. The lack of Steam overlay. You can't chat with friends without alt-tabbing and you can't take screenshots via Steam too.In conclusion, even though the game looks outdated, it truly withstood the test of time. Stronghold Crusader is still a very good game and will give hours of fun. I really recommend this game.			",81,14,0,16,24,0,16

												Years after I played Stronghold Crusader for the first time, I happen to find it again on Steam. I've immediately started playing for hours, because even after all these years, it's one of the best games I've played. The economic systems are really great, the castle building is fun and sieging and battling your enemies should keep you occupied for quite some time!Also fling dead cows into your enemy base, burn their castle down and dig moats around their entire fort, which will make them starve, run out of pretty much every resource and beg for mercy,10/10, still playing.

												A great Strategy game, and one of the best fort builders.It has multi layered industries all with they're own animations.A good variety of troops and enemies.The campaign is rather hard, but doable.Unfortunately the game has a anti-lose formula Crossbowmen + Engineers, they are the best defense and the best offense, they make every other unit look weak by comparison, the only thing they can't do is kill a lord, but by that time his fortress will be in ruins and any melee squad will do to end him.

												""Greetings Lord Flying Poo!""(enter your name as Flying Poo and restart the game... you're welcome!)Stronghold Crusader was and still is my all time favorite stragegy title ever (followed closely by A Bridge Too Far and the older Command and Conquer titles).Having tried the whole Stronghold series I've found the rest of the titles to be a failed attempt at getting the recipe correct.Stronghold Crusader 2 Hasn't worked it's wonders on me either.Anywho! Crusader is a 3D effect 2D title with basic graphics (good for it's day) and superb gameplay.The title has been remastered slightly to allow for more modern display resolutions (hence the ""HD"" in the title) as before you were limited to 1024x786 on your shiny 1080p screen!Now you can see a full 1080p so play on huge TV is even possible!The aim of this game is simple, start mission with barely any resources but usually enough to build the basics and start your first line of defence, your castle!Once in full swing you'll have peasant turning into bakers, diary farmers, pub landlords, woodcutters, stonemasons and many more to build your stockpile and granary. You'll need to balance these carefully as the more peasants you have living in your castle the more food they need.Once your resources are taken care of you need to build an army.Building an army is done of in one of 3 ways, either supplying the armour and weapons (making these from iron, leather etc) and combining these with jobless peasants to create a mega army, making an army from mercenary posts (not as strong as a self made army but a quick way of buidling numbers) or relying on a outpost (disabled in some missions).Your objective from this point is clear... destroy your enemies.Why is Crusader special? It's got a certain charisma and charm, it just feels right. It's very easy to pickup so great for beginners and advanced gamers and will keep anyone interested for many hours!Did I mention the castle builder and map creator modes?Castle builder is for those who just want to create a castle and be left alone for hours on end until it's self sustaining.Map creator is for those who want to (let's be honest now) create a map with an unfair advantage to the other players.System requirements are so low you could run it on anything from a super low spec Intel Atom to an 16core Xeon.Overall I'd say a solid 10/10 and a must have for anyones steam account.I hope there is a Crusader 3, but I strongly hope they base it on this title rather than the other Stronghold series.Also, if reworked slightly for Linux compatabilty, perhaps getting it to run on a Raspberry Pi 2!

												Stronghold crusader will in my mind, always be one of the best games of all time. With its humble,vindicitve, or even annoying AI charecters each match has the chance to present a new challenge. Wether it is the wolf building his fortresses that take 30 minutes to destroy with catapults or the caliph constantly torching your goods.Pros:70+ maps that will take hours to complete. The satisfaction you get when you complete the trail is great.Good simulation - You handle the basic necessities of your people and don't have to do silly redundant stuff.Rememberable and Challengeing AI. On occasion my friends and i will say a quote from them, and all of us still chuckle.Peacefull map modes for those who wish to just watch thier empire strech across the entire map.Easy to use interface that allows you to build your castle, wether it is collapsing the map height to the ground or rotating the screen in just a mouse click.Did i mention CASTLES? Build your castle huge, small or not at all. Be  the lord you want to be.Graphics are really quite good for a dated game.( Over ten years ago) i still tolerate them, and i won't play minecraft because of its graphics. Cons:Kinda meh online multiplayer, it comes with a 3rd party client called game ranger that has a pretty decent sized community. But the games can be laggy/choppy depending on who you're connected to.Can't place that there my lord.Overall, i would recommend this game to any Castle Sim/RTS fanatic. A great game, which in my childhood i probably have over 1000k hours in. Watch your back future knights, don't trust the Caliph. ",62,14,2,26,18,0,35

Memories aside, this game is awesome and it gives you endless fun, literally endless, well the only con in Single Player is when you learn each characters building styles you can easily defeat them, but online......online is a slaughter. One thing you should note is I dont play strategies, especially new ones the only strategies I ever played/play are Stronghold Crusader and Red Alert 2 and I JUST found out that SC is on Steam.....JUST NOW! Dont bother with Stronghold Crusader 2 tho, since its not even close to this. Just enjoy this masterpiece of the game..			",148,16,7,26,11,2,15

												Years after I played Stronghold Crusader for the first time, I happen to find it again on Steam. I've immediately started playing for hours, because even after all these years, it's one of the best games I've played. The economic systems are really great, the castle building is fun and sieging and battling your enemies should keep you occupied for quite some time!Also fling dead cows into your enemy base, burn their castle down and dig moats around their entire fort, which will make them starve, run out of pretty much every resource and beg for mercy,10/10, still playing.

												Ah, Stronghold Crusader. I remember this game when I was maybe......6?This game really brings back memories with the floppy disk games.Anyway lets review!Note: Buying the game will also include Stronghold Crusader Extreme but that is so terrible so I wont review it.THE GAMEStronghold Crusader HD is a castle sim with I think 4 modes.Career/Story: Really just a set of tutorials and starting battles to get you ready to play the all grand skirmish mode(I think thats what its called) but never the less it can be fun but only sometimes.Skirmish/Battle: This is probably what makes this game grand. It puts you in a screen where you decide things like the map, how many players fight, where they fight, difficulty, starting money, etc. Then you start building a castle and an army to help you crush the other players while not getting recked yourself. THIS IS WHAT YOU GET THE GAME FOR. I bet it would be fun in MP but none of my friends have it :(Castle Builder- Just the mode if you want to build a huge castle, no enemies just you, your people, and that annoying flippin guide. (WHY?)Multiplayer- If someone wants to add me to play this mode please do ;_;AUDIOThe game has solid voice acting from every character and they talk to you at the right times sometimes indicating how you should prepare, like telling you ""youre kingdom will get crushed"" could indicating that they're lanuching an assault at you. The fighting audio is good but the people getting hit by arrows sounds like there coughing and screaming. Your castle based on how many people actually work it gets more or less chattery and theres less sounds of nature. The only REALLY bad voice acting is your guide, he doesnt change his accent when you change to like a british guy and his voice is just annoying but funny to abuse sometimes. Audio-8/10GAMEPLAYWell as I explained in the modes section you are usually fighting other players, but most of the time youre trying to get people in your kingdom and keep them in your kingdom by maintaning food, taxes, and atractions for your people (like a dancing bear strapped to a pole wtf). Gameplay 9/10STORYLINEI really dont think i should rate this but I will. The game yes has a story mode but it's mostly a tutorial with basic battles. The games story really comes mostly from the gameplay. Think of games like dota 2, CSGO, and TF2 mostly the story comes out of what you do and see, not whats told. Storyline 7/10GraphicsThe graphics would obvioulsy be outdated for a game as old as this but you can see whats going on and not feel like you cant see what that means or indicates. Pretty solid graphics if you look at its age. Im gonna count the score as if I was rating this in the year this was released. Graphics 10/10AI  Since this is what most people have to play with ill make a section for it. As I stated in audio the AI will give you hints about whats about to happen but it might not always happen, making them pretty clever enemies. Each king has a different tactic. Some  build the castle a lot others go and start buiding an army, and some also try to build up they're economy so they could buy troops late game. But each kind changes his tactic depending on what he sees so the AI is different every time.  It could use polishing sometimes though. AI 9/10REPLAYABILITYAs I just said the AI's tactic always changes so you never have the same game twice. Also there are TONS of different maps. By tons I mean like 30 maps each ranging on how many maximum players there can be and I think you are able to get more maps (IDK though). Replayability 10/10VERDICTStronghold Crusader's 10$ price tag is well worth it for such and old and polished game like this.FINAL RATING: 8.6/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Essentially a tower defence game and still one of the best tower defence/strategy game you will ever play! Resource management, defence management, offensive tactics got it all rapped in lovely medieval package. AI is quite challenging as well.Upsides: Castles with moats,  gate houses with drawbridges, clever system of building units need a fletcher to make a bow/crossbow but first you need wood then you need cows for the tanner to slaughter to get the leather armour for your crossbow men interlinking economy very clever. (The little things that new strategy games dont do anymore)Did I mention Castles which you build from scratch and a pop cap of 1000 was insanity but 10K COME ON BUY IT!Downsides: If your a flid at Strategy in real life don't bother this game it will tear you a new one.

												""Greetings Lord Flying Poo!""(enter your name as Flying Poo and restart the game... you're welcome!)Stronghold Crusader was and still is my all time favorite stragegy title ever (followed closely by A Bridge Too Far and the older Command and Conquer titles).Having tried the whole Stronghold series I've found the rest of the titles to be a failed attempt at getting the recipe correct.Stronghold Crusader 2 Hasn't worked it's wonders on me either.Anywho! Crusader is a 3D effect 2D title with basic graphics (good for it's day) and superb gameplay.The title has been remastered slightly to allow for more modern display resolutions (hence the ""HD"" in the title) as before you were limited to 1024x786 on your shiny 1080p screen!Now you can see a full 1080p so play on huge TV is even possible!The aim of this game is simple, start mission with barely any resources but usually enough to build the basics and start your first line of defence, your castle!Once in full swing you'll have peasant turning into bakers, diary farmers, pub landlords, woodcutters, stonemasons and many more to build your stockpile and granary. You'll need to balance these carefully as the more peasants you have living in your castle the more food they need.Once your resources are taken care of you need to build an army.Building an army is done of in one of 3 ways, either supplying the armour and weapons (making these from iron, leather etc) and combining these with jobless peasants to create a mega army, making an army from mercenary posts (not as strong as a self made army but a quick way of buidling numbers) or relying on a outpost (disabled in some missions).Your objective from this point is clear... destroy your enemies.Why is Crusader special? It's got a certain charisma and charm, it just feels right. It's very easy to pickup so great for beginners and advanced gamers and will keep anyone interested for many hours!Did I mention the castle builder and map creator modes?Castle builder is for those who just want to create a castle and be left alone for hours on end until it's self sustaining.Map creator is for those who want to (let's be honest now) create a map with an unfair advantage to the other players.System requirements are so low you could run it on anything from a super low spec Intel Atom to an 16core Xeon.Overall I'd say a solid 10/10 and a must have for anyones steam account.I hope there is a Crusader 3, but I strongly hope they base it on this title rather than the other Stronghold series.Also, if reworked slightly for Linux compatabilty, perhaps getting it to run on a Raspberry Pi 2!

												Stronghold crusader will in my mind, always be one of the best games of all time. With its humble,vindicitve, or even annoying AI charecters each match has the chance to present a new challenge. Wether it is the wolf building his fortresses that take 30 minutes to destroy with catapults or the caliph constantly torching your goods.Pros:70+ maps that will take hours to complete. The satisfaction you get when you complete the trail is great.Good simulation - You handle the basic necessities of your people and don't have to do silly redundant stuff.Rememberable and Challengeing AI. On occasion my friends and i will say a quote from them, and all of us still chuckle.Peacefull map modes for those who wish to just watch thier empire strech across the entire map.Easy to use interface that allows you to build your castle, wether it is collapsing the map height to the ground or rotating the screen in just a mouse click.Did i mention CASTLES? Build your castle huge, small or not at all. Be  the lord you want to be.Graphics are really quite good for a dated game.( Over ten years ago) i still tolerate them, and i won't play minecraft because of its graphics. Cons:Kinda meh online multiplayer, it comes with a 3rd party client called game ranger that has a pretty decent sized community. But the games can be laggy/choppy depending on who you're connected to.Can't place that there my lord.Overall, i would recommend this game to any Castle Sim/RTS fanatic. A great game, which in my childhood i probably have over 1000k hours in. Watch your back future knights, don't trust the Caliph. ",62,14,2,26,18,0,35

												Who wouldn't want to command medieval warriors during the crusades? You can be the Crusaders, or the Arabian Forces of the Middle East. Build epic castles, attack epic castles, live in epic castles, and eat in epic castles. But, you, as a lord, must keep thy people happy. Thy people will need food, protection, shelter, and mongooses. Okay, maybe not mongooses.Fear factor is also a thing to keep in mind, if you are a jerk no one will want to be in your castle. If you are nice and save the dying tigers in Africa people will want to work for you. Also, if you're nice your troops will do better in combat. If you're mean your troops will do worst in combat.I have only played 4 hours as of writing this review and I already love this game.			",12,2,0,1,4,0,0

												One of the games that sparked my love for pc gaming. Stronghold Crusader HD, is a familiar feel from the original Stronghold. Improving on everything, while keeping in tact all the things you loved about the first. The game is fun played online, although more popular still online in Europe, than the US. Great campaign that allows you to travel from foe to foe, increase difficulty as you go. Or if you just enjoy building, castle building to build the perfect castle. I love this game, and it still is one of my favorites.			",1,0,0,1,3,0,0

												Though i have little hours on steam with this game i have played 100 hours of this game outside steam.Stronghold Crusader is a magnificent game as you have probably read from the other reviews. However, there is some key aspects to the game as in some game changing exploits that need to be made clear. Before you buy this game intending to pummel some people online into the ground i have come across a few exploits that unfortunately break the game.EXPLOITS ~~~ The exploits I'm about to talk about refer to the ""sleep"" mode given at every work space that your workers use. This sleep or making your workers redundant mode can be clicked with excessive speed. if you turn it on then off, the redundant mode (which is suppose to make your workers turn into peasants again) will pause your workers for a second then continue working, whilst more peasants turn into more workers which creates two workers for every one work space in stead of just one worker. this is known and duplicating your workers. this basically doubles your production rate which basically doubles your power. GG easy. (this was hard to explain)The second and most destructive (maybe not an exploit) ""way of thinking"" is to do with the redundant mode again. (making your workers turn back into peasants). After vsing someone online that i saw do this to me (and after commending him with his efforts after he butt♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me like a mad man) you are able to mass create an army using work spaces that require many peasants such as 'mills'. These mills hold 3 boys that take wheat and turn them into flour bags. But if you make 30 mills or so, over time your peasants will turn into these boys until all mills have work. Congratulations now hit the redundant button and gain your self 90 peasants instantaneously +24 peasants max cap at the castle. now i simply create 114 men then simple turn back off the redundant mode and start creating more boys for the mills. This way of working basically is a work around the max cap of 24 peasants at your castle, by simply turning your peasants into workers (for more holding space) then turning them back into peasants for mass production.After seeing my enemy have 500 horse archers and 35 catapults within 20 minutes of the game i could not get even close with anyone as 35 flying rocks also kills an army very fast let alone walls.Depressing as this was this is the reason why mills are so expensive in Stronghold Crusader 2 which is am SO THANKFUL FOR.Stronghold crusader is a great game but there is a glitich or two or a clever way of thinking that over powers the rest.I just want everyone to realise that this game has its issues that wont be fixed as the game is old but b4 you buy try to to cheat plz..... my butt is still sore. (multiplayer uses external program called 'game ranger' that is automatically installed - steam servers are not used)			",160,21,1,12,23,1,29

												This game....! So many memories and hours spent on it, playing it since I was a kid! SO MANY LAN GAMES....and raging over friends and making new friends over this game, the memories! Memories aside, this game is awesome and it gives you endless fun, literally endless, well the only con in Single Player is when you learn each characters building styles you can easily defeat them, but online......online is a slaughter. One thing you should note is I dont play strategies, especially new ones the only strategies I ever played/play are Stronghold Crusader and Red Alert 2 and I JUST found out that SC is on Steam.....JUST NOW! Dont bother with Stronghold Crusader 2 tho, since its not even close to this. Just enjoy this masterpiece of the game..			",148,16,7,26,11,2,15

												Well where to start i grew with games like this Age of empires Rise of nations etc. But above them all i love this game more then them all with it's complex resources Troops and before we get to that this game is not like Starcraft 2 or Dawn of war with gas or minerals this you have food wood stone iron weapons and much much more. Build your own castle how you want be an Evil lord make people work harder and hate you make your troops haul a$$. you want to be the great kind lord with the people behind you but be lazy as hell go for it build armies of 250 in a 8 player game bulid a army of a 1000 in a 1v1 in the great words of shia labeouf ""Just do it"". this Game has all you want if you are in to RTS slow enough for people that like Dow and people that wanna sit back relax and love the game and be proud of there castle but fast enough for people that love games like Sc2 or Act of war this game is great what are you waiting for buy it 10$ get it Now before shia labeouf Eats you			",103,4,0,15,11,0,28

												An epic game from the era 2000's. My all time fav. game(infact this whole series.)Bought this today and already played 2 hours. The best part is, it works on Windows 8.1 Flawlessly, since, I thought, this old game might not be able to run well on Newer versions of windows, but to my amazement, it works perfectly.What else am I supposed to say about this game, just go ahead and get it.Pros.1. Who should buy?If you like to play, build and conquer type games(Strategic) definatly go ahead with this game. So, this might be a substitute for AOE games.2. Is gameplay quick?This is unlike any other strategic games, this might take a while for the new player who isn't verymuch familer with the game moves, inventory etc, but once you get the hold of it, there is no stopping. :)3. Is graphics good?Well, keep it in mind, this ain't now 2016 game, the initial relese of the game was in 2002, and later the HD parts, so comapring the games with that era, definalty graphics are not at all bad. Infact, I never felt about any graphical bug issue.4. If one word to say?FANTABULOUS.5. Should I get it?Even after reading all this, if you are thinking wheather or not should you, I will say, try it. :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Best taunts in any RTS""The camels are restless. They are bad omen for you, I think.""""The vultures are gathering, they circle over your pathetic castle.""""So you can fight a little. Well, fight a little harder!""There are tons of stats you can play around with that will effect your economy, and in some cases where the map is very small the economy can win or lose you the match. The level of detail you can add to your castle is also a huge pluse over other RTS games.			",78,5,0,5,5,0,3

												Greetings sire! The desert awaits you!Thats the first line you gonna hear...thats the only line you ever will need...The best desert castle builder i can remember of...+Good diversion of units to use+Castle management (your materials you use for building structures, building your army or satisfying your people)+Diverse selection of AI enemies you can fight against+Nice selection of maps+Long and somehow challenging campaign maps (have chance to even 3x skip mission if its too hard to overcome)+Historical campaigns+You can chose wheter you want an european lord or arabic lord as your lord skin+Map editor+Nice graphics for an old game+EXTREME - play good ol´ stronghold in an extreme way, more armies and special abilities to help you...contains a campaign too thats is really challenging (never completed it myself)+Castle builder mode, for those moments when you want peacefully build up a castle that will endure the test of time...-AI sometimes - they try to build their boxy predefined castles even when there is no space for them to build it there, either leaving them with holes in the walls where tower should be but cant be placed or totally boxed with no gate for their workers to gather materials/food-AI again - they attack in small bunches instead of big mass, granting you easy chance to effectively destroy the whole siege part by part by your archers and crossbowmen or your mangonels and ballistaeAlso there is no story or main character in the whole campaign...you are just unnamed lord who want to conquest every battlefield...some people might find this discouraging....but everything is permitted in war so grab your sword and fight...Source: apart of having quite small amount of hours played on steam version i played more than 500 hours on classic Stronghold Crusader + Warchest and Stronghold Crusader Extreme before it even hit steam in HD edition....Definetly worth every penny if you like castle builders, medieval warfare or their combinations...

												I am so very happy that I rolled the dice and bought this game.  I love stratagy games and this one is a peach.  That it was on sale at the time only makes me all the more happy.  In truth, I'd recommend the game at the current full price of ten bucks.  I think I'll be playing this one for a good long time.There is a steep learning curve and I got pretty frustrated at first.  I'd suggest you watch a play through or two if you don't like getting stomped.  The AI isn't the brightest, at least not on the earliest missions (the ones I'm on as of this review), but that's probably for the best.  I'm sure I'd have given up otherwise.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Back before Steam I bought this game 4 times. played it so damn much i wore out the disk, every chance i got i would share this game with my friends, either giving them an extra copy, or reccomending they buy it. 250 hours alone on steam doesn't nearly count towards my total time over the past 10 years. the amount of humour put into the dialogue of characters, with the cheesy cgi, and the somewhat sassy match narrator, the incredibly memorable music, the seemingly endless campaign map, the nearly overwhelming odds in the later missions, the great map editor, the variety of Ai designed castles, with various schemes and unit themes set to their playstyle, all of this adds up to one of the most solidly memorable, and always revisitable strategy/building sims ever made. its a joyous ride for someone who enjoys min-maxing, equally as much as someone who enjoys relaxed building. Under 10$, and on sale for $2.50 is an absolute steal.			",164,28,6,22,18,1,48
