												King's Bounty is one of the most charming games I've played.  For an extensive review of the entire series, my blog: http://waltermstewart.wordpress.com/2013/01/15/kings-bounty-series-review, for a condense review of this game, read on.This is the first entry in the series and it is well worth the current listing price, but it frequently goes on sale (at least 3 times a year if I recall, also available in a bundle pack if I'm not mistaken).  This game is an adventure/exploration game in a generic fantasy world following all the common tropes.  The primary difference between this game's lore and the world you are already familiar with is the sense of humor the writers have.  If you take the time to read the text (no voice overs), you will be rewarded with the occasional typo (originally from Russian), but more frequently a wonderful lore based joke, parodying modern fantasy lore.The battles and strategy within are quite fun, and the game progresses reasonably, but it doesn't ruin the experience and shouldn't prevent you from playing this game.If you like RPGs, quest driven games, turn based or grid based strategies, I highly recommend this game.

												This game is complex and encourages you to use different tactics, while still being very user-friendly. You'll immediatly get absorbed into this fairy-tale world, wich offers a variety of (beautiful) environments. The game contains both humorous and serious moments and the different characters that you meet are colorful and original. King's Bounty: The Legend is pretty long (I spent around 85 hours into the campaign) when you want to do everything, but it's really worth it and, as stated above, doesn't get boring because you'll always encounter new environments and characters. I had a blast with this game and I can only hope that you will, too.			",355,72,6,30,25,2,37

												I never tried a King's Bounty game until a few days ago. I now regret not having discovered this treasure earlier. While only a handful of hours into the game, thus far it has already surpassed all expectations and the regard I had for HOMM 1-6 and Disciples 3. If you liked any of of the HOMM iterations or Disciples, you will appreciate King's Bounty: The Legend. My only regret is in buying the game standalone instead of a bundle which I'll now buy as still a better bargain than grabbing the expansions singularly. Enjoy Friends :)EDIT: To give a bit mroe detail the game, I come to King's Bounty with serious HOMM experiece and a bit of Discpiples. IMO, the HOMM and Disciples are grreat series' but they all fall down at the point of eventually aving spent hours upon hours to build huge armies only to find the AI has outdone you. King's Bounty so far has enough in the smaller side quests to be rewarding enough to give the above review while avoiding ""Enemy Heroes"" while I build up my Mage in readiness to take over the world ;]In summary, If you haven't played the series before but enjoy the ""HOMMi=-like"" subgenre as I saw it, you will love this game.

TL;DR? See ConclusionINTRODUCTION:King's Bounty: The Legend is a 2008 'Tactical role-playing' game and the 'spiritual sequel' to the popular 1990 game 'King's Bounty' by the now defunct New World Computing, Inc.The game features the traditional turn based combat of Heroes of Might and Magic, while at the same time, have the quest, story telling, and progression system of an RPG game.King's Bounty: The Legend was made by Russian Developer 'Katauri Interactive' and was published by 1C Company.PLOT (No Spoilers):The game follows the adventures of a newly ordained knight who is appointed as the Kingdom's 'Treasurer Searcher.' During his travels, he is tasked to deliver a strange and supposedly powerful artifact called the Chest of Rage to the King. Before he can finish his task, the chest, along with its powers, binds itself to the knight.With this artifact, the knight must unlock its power and use it to defeat an ancient evil that has awoken and who is now seeking to destroy the entire world.PROS:+ Very good graphics and special effects for its age (about 8 years old at the time of this review);+ Excellent use of classical gameplay mechanics;+ Addition of new game elements that makes the classic style much more fun;+ Excellent blend of the 'Heroes of Might and Magic' gameplay with traditional RPG elements;+ Large variety of creatures to recruit;+ Relatively large and beautifully rendered game world;+ Tons of side quests that can keep the player busy, however...(See CON #1);+ Relatively lengthy game time;+ Challenging but fair difficulty levels; and+ Good overall story, however...(See CON #2).CONS:- The side quests can either be really interesting or really boring and mundane;- The story starts slowly and could potentially bore a few players at the start;- Very limited dialogue options between the player and the NPCs;- Limited in fast travel options;- The game is limited to only 3 classes of heroes.- Chest of Rage cannot be used during boss battles.NEUTRAL:+/- No voice acting apart from the ones in the cinematics;+/- No multiplayer or hotseat game modes;+/- Due to its age, there is no widescreen support;+/- Very limited interaction options with the hero's spouse.CONCLUSION:GREAT GAME that captures the traditional tactical gameplay of the Heroes of Might and Magic series and blending it pleasantly with several RPG elements thus making for a fun and nostalgic gaming experience.WORTH IT?YES. The game cost $6.99 (or your regional equivalent) at its full price. If the game or the Collector's Pack is on a sale, then any turn based strategy fan should consider this in their collection.Be it noted that there exists a Collector's Pack which also includes the sequels (Armored Princess, Crossworlds, Warriors of the North, and Warriors of the North – Ice and Fire expansion)FINAL NOTES:Heroes of Might and Magic has been mentioned here. This comparison is present because New World Computing made both the original King's Bounty and Heroes of Might and Magic series of games. NWC has admitted publicly that the Heroes franchise was built upon the mechanics of the original King's Bounty.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												One of the best games I've ever played!King's Bounty: The Legend is a RPG with tactical battles. The battle system is reminiscent of Heroes of Might and Magic, but King's Bounty is not a strategy game, like Heroes. Instead, you explore the (huge) game world at your own pace, without having to worry about some opponent getting stronger if you take your time.You explore the maps (in real time) to gather resources and troops, then defeat monsters that are roaming the map, or guarding some chest... or even just waiting for you to try to kill them. The game doesn't have many mandatory battles, each enemy you defeat gives you experience, so you need to kill them to get enough XP to level up your hero.  When you get close to some enemy, the game changes to a hexagonal grid, and places your troops vs the enemy troops in a turn-based strategic combat. There's LOTS of strategy involved here, BTW. You can't just move your troops casually in the battlefield, this WILL get you killed quite fast! Instead, you have to think before moving each troop, even ONE badly placed unit can mean your defeat.Just like the first 3 Heroes games, you don't use your hero directly in battles. Instead, you control your troops, but can use magics and skills of your hero once per turn. The hero is VERY important, since a well placed magic can turn the tide of a battle in your favor. The game is very extensive. The map is huge, there are LOTS of optional battles, a big variety of troops for you to acquire, a robust skill tree for your hero (that includes some passive skills to make your troops better), a simple marriage system and tons of side-quests scattered around. The game is HUGE. While you can beat it in 50 or so hours, you can play it for 100 hours and still have something to do and some enemy to kill. Not only that, but the game has a random placement of enemies, and 3 different heroes to choose, so there's a nice replay value.Lastly, the technical aspects aren't bad. The graphics are beautiful (with a big variety of textures in most environments), your units are very detailed and the game has some very good looking special effects (spells, detailed shadows, bloom). The sounds are very good too, and each unit has its own grunts and taunts. Also, the game has some AMAZING musics by Lind Erebros. Each map has its own playlist of songs, and they usually mix well with the environments of the map you are in.Anyway, King's Bounty is amazing. It has some minor flaws, like a cruel difficulty spike and lots of backtracking (specially to replenish troops), its not a friendly game towards newbies (good troop units aren't finite, you can't reset your skill trees allocation without restarting the game, etc). Also, the story is very forgettable, and the dialogs are usually very stupid. But the flaws don't hurt the game. Its a huge game, with LOTS of things to do and huge maps to explore. Its also slow paced, so you don't have to rush, like in the Heroes series.I QUITE recommend this game. Just don't expect to have a casual stroll in here. ^^			",249,83,4,78,7,0,12

												In my opinion one of the best, if not the absolute number one, turn-based strategy game and I have played a lot of them...Pros: + Deep strategy layer that forces you to adapt to different situations+ Beatiful graphics for environment, units, spells and rage spirits+ Plenty of different environments, enemies, bosses and epic battles+ Clever mechanism of leadership/mana/rage meter not allowing the formation invisible armies+ challenging situations even in normal difficulty+ shows significant differences with established model (i.e. HoMM) with respect to turn based system+ long campaignCons- sometimes camera/environment can cause difficulties in locating objects- map is not very informative (on the other hand you can make notes on it)- requires a lot of backtracking, more fast-travel options would be welcomed- could be a bit more informative when you take the first stepsAll in all, absolutely and heartily recommended to all fans of turn-based and strategy games!

												This game is a living classics of the strategy genre -- if any of you played the original King's Bounty (released in 1990-1992), you'd be amazed to see the resemblance. Developers have put their soul into making the new King's Bounty as oldschool as it gets. Except for graphics -- it's 2015 now, and it still looks really great.As of the gameplay itself, imagine ""Heroes of Might & Magic"" meet ""Space Rangers"" (another living classics, by the way): you have something like an open fantasy world to explore (few huge locations, actually, but it's close enough), where you can hire creatures of every kind, find loot (artifacts, gold, XP), complete quests of various kinds. Hell, you can even marry here (your wife will give you children, which would provide bonuses to your skills -- sick stuff, right?).The battles look like Heroes -- classical TBS faceoff: you're placing your units on one side, your opponent stands on the other. You both can cast spells, and you can even summon guardians (think Final Fantasy) to damage your opponent or buff your own troops.The storyline is excellent -- it ha everything: irony, mystery, sideline quests, and even multiple quests choices.This is the first game of it's franchise, so if you're wondering about trying a new oldschool strategy -- it's a must that you'll buy this game.I'd rate it 9.0 out of 10.0.

												I have pondered for a quite a while if I should try any of the King's Bounty games, but never got around to it. I must say, despite being very sceptical of the series, up to this point, I am very pleased with King's Bounty, especially when I got all the games, except the newly released title King's Bounty: Dark Side, for 75% off. If you like the Heroes of Might and Magic series, then you will surely like these games as well.Very similar in style and gameplay. As it turns out, the King's Bounty series actually came before the Heroes games, dating all the way back the days of the NES console. Heroes of Might and Magic has actually been directly inspired by King's Bounty, and this can been seen all across the board in King's Bounty.As mentioned, the gameplay is almost similar to Heroes, with the exception of base building and maintenance.You create a hero, selected from three classes and then you complete quests (side and main), leveling up in a classic RPG fashion. Very straight forward, no BS. A very casual, yet still intriguing and awesome game. Do try it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Terribly addicting game for either those who lost many hours playing Heroes, or anyone who likes nice RPG games... Many hours of interesting gameplay, nice combat and colourful visuals...As a downside I'd mention that there are some unbalanced abilities and impossible encounters (probably for later) and bad translation... But nothing too serious...Recommended!			",557,190,23,78,59,10,107

												10/10 - Little Towns, Big Worlds and an Epic Amount of Content!I’m way late getting to play this game but it’s still amazing even for today's standards! This game really is really withstanding the test of time. The campaign is pretty epic, and just solely finishing the campaign took me about 33 hours!! If you explore everything and complete all the quests you are looking at about 60-70+ hours of gameplay! Not too bad for just a couple bucks. I’m pleased to announce that there are about 4 more games in this series waiting for me and more to come!The world exploration, story and turn-based grid combat come together in a brilliant fashion and really keep you captivated longer than you could anticipate! A few points to consider to maximize your enjoyment of the game! 1) The font is super small! There is a mod you can drop in the folder to increase text size; this isn’t available for the other games so take advantage of this since the story is really good. Every character and quest has some serious depth if you care to explore!2) Until you get the hang of things try to stick to the main storyline indicated with a crown. This will ensure you stick to battles that you can win. You won’t be completing a full island at once since different levels of enemies are all around, it can be easy to mistakenly run into an unbeatable enemy. 3) Prevent frustration and use the right mouse button to click on enemies from afar. This will indicate the power level of the enemy ranging from Very Weak to Invincible! If you are wondering you can defeat enemies up to very strong but proceed at your own risk! Overall, A MASSIVE value no matter how you look at it. It’s only $7! If you complete the campaign only you are looking at about 21 cents an hour for some fantastic gaming! Feel free to drop me a message if you can’t find the mod. I will complete the other games for sure! Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

												Tried this game. Well English translation is not the best, so if you know Russian like me, then I would recommend to play it in Russian. But the game itself is a mixture of many fantasy (and a little bit of sci-fi) ideas, put together into one story, but if you are into stuff like this you will like the plot.Gameplay is nice, similar to Heroes of might and magic for fights, but is kind of RPG for everything else. And the game itself is true to the original King Bounty in many ways (I did play that one back in the day)			",98,17,2,40,17,0,13

												The graphics remind me a lot of Warcraft III.  This is a turn based strategy game set in a colorful and atmospheric fantasy world with a very nice and energetic soundtrack.  It kinda works like JRPGs, there are monsters/enemies wandering the map and if you attack them or get near, you enter a battle screen.  On one side of the battlefield is your army which is composed of up to 5 different unit type of your choice (you find different unit types throughout the whole game) and the other side is the enemy.  You each take turns commanding a specific unit and issue a specific command, you can also use a magic from your spellbook or inventory to help turn the tide towards your favor.It's a pretty decent Turn based RTS game but I can't run this game on my mac anymore because this game doesn't like mac for some reason and developers don't seem to give a damn.  Would play it more often if it weren't for this major issue.			",19,1,0,10,2,0,6

												Great game. Perfect for someone who always found games like Heroes of Might & Magic appealing, but isn't very good at strategy games, i.e. me. And while at the first glance King's Bounty might look like a turn based strategy game, it is in fact primarily a role playing game - just the tactical battles are mechanically reminiscent of aformentioned HoM&M series.Huge, well designed fairytale-like gameworld (split into different zones) can be freely explored and shouldn't be rushed through because the game heavily rewards patience. Carefully choosing opponents, backtracking to previously visted places to recruit troops for your party, planning every move in battles to prevent heavy loses of units - all of this will make the overall journey to the final boss easier, but also significantly longer.Good, colorful graphics, very nice music, lots of quests to complete, places to visit, battles to fight - King's Bounty: The Legend is definately worth your money.

												I am having some amazing fun with this game.An adventure / RPG game that has you travelling around the world of Darian, completing quests for your king and other missions for the many other characters you come across. The exploration mode is a point and click venture, while the battle sequences are a hex-based turn based strategy affair.The levelling up system works very well, but you only level yourself up, not your units. The only way of acquiring new units (including replacing lost units) is to buy them again and while this works, you begin to learn that you only have a finite number of units (other than swordsman and archers), which, after losing multiple higher level units which are irreplacable, came as somewhat of a disappointment. Also, replacing units can become slightly tedious.However, with that said I am thoroughly enjoying the game as a whole and I am looking forward to playing the other three in the series. The graphics are very good, the music is enjoyable and the game is challenging.Recommended.			",145,39,10,21,27,1,74

												This game is a classic. I bought it many times, first time on a disc way back in 2009, then a few more times as gifts for my friends and now here on Steam. Sad to say but I haven't played a better RPG/strategy since. King's Bounty: The Legend and Disciples 2 are the reasons I got into game development. These two games are my two all time favorite games. One day I hope to do something comparable but being a small indie studio it might take a while to get there :)Currently playing on impossible difficulty with no losses. 10 black dragons out of 10!

												King's Bounty is the Heroes of Might and Magic I've always wanted to play, but never knew it. The key difference? King's Bounty is a single player game. The Map screen is not turn-based, but real time; You're not managing any army of heroes and castles, just the one hero. But in exchange you get richer character development, as well as stories and quests; More of an RPG experience.Presentation; The Tutorial is adequate, and there's more story then you're probably expecting. The UI is not quite as good as I remember from HoMM games, but quite playable.Gameplay; The Combat is basically the same as from HoMM; But the Map screen being simpler and less managerial means you can focus more on the combat. And if you find yourself in over your head, you can always fall back and rebuild your army, without it costing you turns that the enemy will grow in strength during.Visuals; The graphics quality is more than adequate, and the aesthetic, while not quite as stylized as HoMM was, works fine. My only complaint would be that some of the combat animations are a bit slow, and unskippable.Sounds; The sounds are average. Little voice acting, which may disappoint some, for how much text there is in the story.In conclusion; While lacking multiplayer, King's Bounty offers a more fun single player experience, in my opinion.

												King's Bounty: The Legend was my first meeting with this kind of turn based RPG and I was left speechless. The game provides so much fun whether you like exploring thoughtfully designed fantasy world in real time or prefer to try out your tactical skills in turn based battles. Units are skillfully balanced and diverse, magic and special skills just add more to the already satisfying diversity of battles. The story may seem to be kind of cliche like, but which ""You are a hero who has to save the world"" is not like that, right? For me it provided entertaining background which urged me on. I have also found quite surprising remarks on Prattchetts The Discworld, every fan of this great series has to appreciate those.			",496,155,21,94,52,3,90

												King's Bounty: The Legend is an amazing game, pulling elements from ""Heroes of Might and Magic"" and weaving it together with that of a strategy game, mixed in with open world exploration. This is a recipe for something truly amazing, and although this game is nearly 10 years old, it still holds up extremely well!Here is a summary of positives (+) and negatives (-):+ Hours of content! I DARE YOU to beat this game in one setting, because you won't! There are many places to explore, treasures to be collected, armies to build, quests to complete, and so much more.+ Replay value. There are randomized elements to the game, such as what enemies you'll face and what items you'll collect. I don't know if this is tied to class choice or not, but it certainly came as a surprise when I found out! Difficulty might affect it too.+ Addictive sense of progression! You truly feel like a heroic commander building up an army over time, growing stronger and stronger as you face greater foes.+ Open ended! You can approach your quests and objectives whenever you want, however you want. Don't want to fight a powerful enemy? Just run around them and get to safety! Want to backtrack to get that treasure you always wanted, and can now defeat the foe guarding it? You can! Higher difficulty levels transform how you approach enemies into a puzzle of careful stealth and area traversal. Use the environment to escape them!+ Colorful graphics! They still hold up very well today with an impressive array of video options, but be warned, this game DOES NOT have 16:9 resolution support. So even if you play at 1080p, you'll get the ""black bar"" experience! Crisp and stylized, with very nice water and some solid textures. Solid art direction.+ Amazing music! Epic, moving, and sweeping fantasy tracks.- Standard and uninteresting fantasy storyline. Made worse by the spelling/grammar/translation issues.- Magic Crystals are too plentiful and become incrediblly useless over time. However, if you are an active magic user, then they are harder to come by.- Can be TOO difficult. On Hard, you will spend your time trying to run around powerful enemies just to get goodies, then escape without ever even defeating them until much later. If you are a masochist, play this game on Hard or Impossible. Normal mode is perfectly challenging enough.- Poor and very strange audio mixing. The sound effects, for some reason, are much more quiet than the obscenely loud music. Some sound effects, in fact, are completely missing.- Numerous typos, translation issues, and grammar errors that are often hilarious, including names such as ""Ruin Guy"" or ""Furious Paladin"".- A few very annoying and very overpowered enemies/units. Wolves are irritating with their stupid Howl ability, Dryads are quite possibly the worst with their ability to put your entire army to sleep repeatedly, and Necromancers are just plain overpowered! Necromancers are broken, being able to raise other Necromancers from the dead for nearly endless battles if you don't take them out.- Unfair and ridiculous ""Item Morale"" and ""Supression"" system. If your enchanted weapon or armor suddenly has terrible morale, you lose all the effects it has, then you must defeat the ""Keepers"" inside of it... which are battles that are sometimes impossible to complete, rendering your powerful item useless! I do not know what affects the morale of an item, but it might be determined by the Race that the items are associated with, that are IN your army. Or the Races your other equipped items are associated with. This is possibly the worst aspect of King's Bounty: The Legend.Overall, King's Bounty: The Legend doesn't have many flaws ( most of the above problems are minor and hardly hurt the game that much ). This entire series is brilliant, addictive, and gripping. If you love Heroes of Might and Magic, but want to feel less restricted, then get this game NOW!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the first game in the King's Bounty series.  If you like turn based army development games like Heroes of Might and Magic, this one is great.  With 3 distinct types of hero to play and several difficulties, it is easy to find a play style that works for you while still maintaining effectiveness.  This game has no respawn (as it should be), so learning to keep your troops alive and manage your resources is paramount to victory.  The only issue I have with the game is that there is a lot of pointless running around to complete some of the quests and reinvest in troops if you have a particularly nasty encounter.  Also one warning that I do not think is really a spoiler.  There are ""boss fights"" in the game although many are avoidable.  For these boss fights you CANNOT use rage.  Troops and magic are fine, but not rage abilities.   I am not sure why they decided to do this, but it makes heavily rage driven characters a bit tougher to play.  Also, I strongly recommend investing in the reserves ability to mitigate the restock of troops issue a bit by keeping extras of your most fragile troops with you.The game length is really solid with a lot to explore and many side quests to accomplish (almost necessary to be strong enough at the end to fight the tougher fights).  Also, anyone who thinks the game is too easy, just put the game on a more challenging setting and see how fast the difficulty ramps up when you are having trouble replenishing your troops.I highly recommend this game.

												My favorite thing about King's Bounty is being able to have a zombie wife. Oh, and also having giant man-eating flytraps tear through your enemies.If you ever played the Heroes of Might and Magic series, then you'll love King's Bounty!The game is like chess with monsters. Your army is the units you recruit in town. As you level up, you can recruit more units. You can also cast spells during battle to give you an edge. It's a solid strategy game with lots of customization! I'm only 2/3rds of the way through the game, and I already spent 50+ hours playing.			",821,290,19,116,69,6,135

												35-40+ hours of your life will be wasted on the role of the royal treasure searcher who is on a quest to save the kingdom of Darion from all sorts of evil and to bring glory to his king.Turn-based combat, HOMM style? Check.Adventures and exploration? Check.Generic fantasy world that can have good jokes about it's generic fantasy tropes? Check.Interesting quests and good RPG elements? Check.Good combat system that can be quite variable if you want it to? Check.Nice graphics, music and atmosphere? Check.It's just a really good game of this genre basically, go play it.A few tips: save often, playing as a pure warrior is a bit of a chore and the mage is bit too overpowered (which isn't a necessary bad thing in this game).

												The longest game in the world. Tough and choreful to play as warrior. The mage blows through battles in a timely fashion. If you buy this for $2 you are getting your monies worth. This game doesn't mess around. Your army will get destroyed countlessly just to get a small fraction of power. If you lose a lot of units in a battle you will just continue struggle inching to get through the game. It's a game where you hardly feel like you are making progress until many hours later. There's a lot of cool♥♥♥♥♥♥in the game. Marriage/family system, loot, decent written dialogue, and decent music. The only con I can think of is that it will take you a century to finish the game. It's so god damn long. If there was one HOMM game to be all HOMM games. This one is it. I recommened it if you are into HOMM style games, and want something really worth your money.I highly don't recommened it if you want an rpg/tactics game that you can play through casually. You will never finish it. Don't get me wrong, I really like this series, its just the games in the series are very long. The Legend is long for all the wrong reasons I feel. There's maybe just a bit too much side quests. They hardly feel optional because your progress will get halted very fast. Overall, it's a very well made game. It just feels insanely long.

												   This game is great, I definately reccomend it.  Combat in this game is alot like Heroes of Might and Magic 3.  The Big differences between this game and HoMM3 are that in this one you only control one hero, and the enemy fights dont build up more if you take your time getting to them, they are all set on their difficulty when the game starts, and that your troop strength is limited by a leadership statistic of your hero's.  You can only hire as many troops at a time as your leadership stat(and your gold) allow. One thing that I realy like about this game is the wide variety of troops that are available.  One thing I slightly dislike about the game is that some of the troops that are appealing to try using may not always be available in high enough numbers to make using them possible.  Each time you start a new game, many of the huts and castles around the map have their supply of troops somewhat randomly generated, so one unit may be usable on one playthrough and not available on the next.  this improves the games replayability, but can be frustrating if there is a particular unit you want to try out.

												Wonderfull game!Having played HOMM a lot, I thought this game to be a spin-off before I started to play the game.Yet, the game, somehow, is original. I cannot explain why.It took me 100+ hrs to finish the game.Wonderfull story. Wonderfull quests. A lot of humor. A lot of easter-eggs.There is a drawback in this game.... The introduction to the mechanism of the game is minimal. Even reading the manual did not help a lot.Just persevere, than you'll enter a wonderfull world full of magical beasts.

												Heroes of Might and Magic with an enchanted 5d20+5 sense of humor. If you decide to try this out, make sure to plan out how you spend ability runes from level one because runes seem to dry up once you start branching out your talent tree. Rage spirits get experience only from doing damage, which requires meticulous study in tactical micromanagement if you want your rage spirits to rain down mayhem in any semblance of actual destructive power (death really is your friend here). Armies are a non-renewable resource so save the best units for hard fights. I played through as a mage with subspecialization in warror talents. I focused on nurturing my spirits of icy death and did a lot of evasive wandering to pull them out of my box of tricks as early as I could. This caused a great deal of fatigue through to midgame. Then I discovered green dragons could be made invisible and battle stealthed my way to the end of the game at about level 15. The final battle was more than tricky but doable thanks to some luck and strategic perseverance: kill high initiative stacks first, attrition through invisibility + manual rage, mana regen from ice & death spirits (mana/rage regen dies out completely during long battles, otherwise mages could go into battle with a single bright-eyed fairy and come out unscathed after having vanquished the legionous hosts of evil). There are several battles in demonland and elsewhere that aren't doable until you max out at level 30 and even then they are tough (discovered through dumplehackery cheatcodes of curiosity). Mariage is available to those who choose it, even for the hard to please suitor seeking a spouse from among the ranks of the undead or perhaps one snatched from the bituminous fires of hell. Be warned though -- good items have better stats than your own children and your children are permanently bound to an inventory slot once you decide to have them.I started Armored Princess but found my strategic palette has been sated more than I thought I knew. Imagine that: I really do miss not having death around. Also, the princess exhibits way too much sartorial irony for my taste, and similar irony was thankfully was absent in The Legend.

												All the King's Bounty games follow the same basic template with only the setting, story and artwork changing between them. You could argue that once you've played once then you've played them all really, not that is necessarily a criticism if the gameplay is good, which it definitely is here. There is a lot of enjoyment to be had exploring the map, levelling up RPG-style, building up armies and fighting enemies in the excellent turn-based combat system. There is a lot of dialogue to read (sadly none of it is voice-acted) and I found it very easy to lose myself for hours in this game. The formula is certainly a very effective one and despite the series being very formulaic I still really like these games. Graphics are dated now (and haven't really improved in future sequels either) but, nevertheless, they are still pleasant-looking and very colourful. The music is also really lovely.A great game to pick up cheap in a Steam sale if you ask me (that's exactly how I bought it!).			",479,150,37,71,44,3,62

												This is a very good game, albeit with a few problems. It is extremely long. It took me 95 hours to beat it, although I finished all quests. I would rather have a campaign 40 hours long with a faster level progression and play it a second time with another class. The story is mostly forgettable, and the running around to restock troops becomes tedious.But the drawbacks are compensated by an excellent turn based combat. The variety in spells and troops allows for many different approaches to the combat, and the fact that the resources of the world are limited pushes you to try to not only win every match, but to do so while minimizing your losses.All in all, this is a good game for those of you who enjoy turn based strategy games like Heroes of Might & Magic, and at the current 9.99EUR, it's hard to say no.

												This first instalment in King's Bounty series has been a great experience for me so far! I was lucky enough to stumble upon it on discount and give it a try. Nope, I wasn't disappointed. Consider a Heroes of Might and Magic game with stronger RPG elements and free roaming on your map - as if you're discovering a Warcraft III map: it is called King's Bounty! It is a great strategy game with a rich setting, interesting gameplay elements and a great deal of fantasy references for the ones that read dialogue texts. I found myself smiling quite often while I was questing in this realm as the Royal Treasure Searcher of the King Mark! I strongly recommend it for both strategy and rpg gamers.

												A well executed hybrid of the RPG and tactical genres, King's Bounty: The Legend is an long and enjoyable game set in a high fantasy world.  The story is unique and entertaining, though, it isn't anything that's going to blow your mind and stick with you for years.  The character building, army building, and exploration are all very well done, however, and they have managed to seal me in for continuing on to the next game in the King's Bounty series in the future.The story begins as you graduate from an academy of sorts and are promoted to the position of the king's Treasure Searcher.  After a bit of exploration on the first couple of maps and a few starter quests the story begins to unfold and you soon find yourself battling against undead foes, horrific demons, unsavory pirates, and just about every other kind of enemy that you can imagine.  I found myself pulled in by the story and each new map reignited my excitement as it brought with it new allies, treasure, and quests that rarely disappointed.The character building aspect of the game is intuitive and works very well for allowing you to customize your hero as you see fit.  At the start of the game you pick a class: Warrior, Paladin, and Mage.  Each has their own skill tree which they are most efficient at gaining abilities from, though, they can also pick and choose from other trees once they have acquired the necessary experience.  This means that by the end of the game you will most likely have a hybrid of sorts, having picked and chosen which skills fit your playstyle best.As for the composition of your army, the selection is enormous.  Though you can only ever have five different types of units in your army, there are dozens that you will find in your adventures that are recruitable.  The leadership mechanic of the game keeps them all viable (more or less) as well.  For example, imagine that your hero has a leadership skill of 5,000.  This means that you could choose to take an enormously powerful unit like black dragons along with you, but as they require a leadership of 2,500, you would only be able to have two of them in that stack.  Meanwhile, you could also recruit peasants, which require five leadership, and you would have a massive gathering of 1,000 of them to send crashing into your enemies' forces.  By the end of the game, you'll have found your own favorite mix-and-match setup which might include knights, elves, demons, undead, pirates, and more.I very much recommend King's Bounty: The Legend to those looking for a game that is very reminiscent of the combat and unit system of Heroes of Might & Magic, especially if they are hoping to get a little bit more of the RPG feel to their game.  I spent over sixty hours in a single playthrough and, for the most part, I found myself entertained from start to finish.  I will definitely be trying out the next game in the series in the near future and am excited to see what new additions and surprises it may have in store.			",622,155,2,165,79,3,130

												After having played Heroes of Might and Magic III for many years, I figured I'd give King's Bounty a go after hearing it was the precursor to HoMM. A worthy precursor it is! This particular version was made after HoMM, but the overall idea was not. Anyway, you choose between playing a warrior, a paladin, or a mage and beat up monsters in an amazing tactical turn-based RPG the likes of HoMM. There are tons of interesting enemies (though they're named very lamely, like ""bowman"" and ""horseman"" :P) and spells and even continents. There's a good deal of exploration throughout the game and the dialogue is outright hilarious at times. The game isn't too short, either; I got a good 50 hours or so out of it and enjoyed it very much; I'll be moving on to its sequel, King's Bounty: Armored Princess. For King's Bounty: The Legend, though, I'd say it definitely deserves a 7.5/10.So, a summary:Pros- Very interesting and fun game mechanics.- Hilarious dialogue.Cons- Navigating can be a pain in the butt sometimes; it'd be really helpful if you could see where you can return a quest, for example.- Running around and around to grab more units gets a little annoying, but I understand this is one consequence of this kind of game.- There's a lot of waiting, either with gathering troops, or waiting for your mana to refill, or trying to find an enemy that isn't too overpowering.- There is something a little off-putting about the game, but I can't quite put my finger on it.Annndddd, Reaper is King. So many amazing abilities. :)			",102,35,2,32,34,2,37

												I'm not a big fan of traditional fantasy but I do love games that do it well. The King's Bounty series has their own spin on high fantasy, a cheerful, tongue-in-cheek take that I appreciate for its charm and its surprises. Underneath that appeal is a solid strategy game with plenty to see and do, too, which makes it a winning combination in my book. Despite a few rough edges for being the first in the series, The Legend is a fantastic place to start some fanciful adventures.As a newly-minted commander under the king, you're tasked to venture forth and aid the people of the kingdom as best you can. Folks have all sorts of troubles, from carnivorous plants sprouting in their gardens to necromancers taking over their towers to thieves stealing their eggs (tends to be more of a griffin problem, that one). It's up to you to recruit an army and sort out their issues, usually through warfare but occasionally with cunning or diplomacy. As you travel the lands of high fantasy you'll start to see a great evil taking shape behind all these distractions, and your quest will lead you through fantastic worlds of crystal and fire before reaching its conclusion.It's a hell of a journey, and you'll have a hell of a lot to do along the way. Your main concern is fielding an army for the turn-based strategic battles that comprise most of the game. Troops can be just about anything you can encounter, from villagers and knights to dragonflies and wolves to ghosts and zombies to pirates and bandits to dragons and griffins. You'll hire them with gold or occassionally earn them through quests, and their ranks are limited by your Leadership score which increases through leveling and exploration.Once in battle you take turns moving your stacks around the hex grid to battle enemies. You command up to five units representing dozens or hundreds (or just one) of those creatures, and their number multiplies their strength in attacking. There are a lot of tactical considerations in battle beyond just movement and spacing, including abilities, weaknesses to unit types, and terrain features. You and your opponent also have access to spells that can damage, buff, or cripple units, and you also get a special set of powers based on a box of spirits you find. Everything I just mentioned can also be leveled up and affected by your own character level and abilities, as well.If this sounds complicated, it really isn't. King's Bounty does an amazing job of easing you into the game via a very effective (and short!) tutorial, and rations out additional systems over the first hour or two of the game proper. A lot of it is pretty clear on its own, such as gearing your character and unlocking skills in his skill tree, thanks to a very intuitive interface that fits a lot of information into easily-readable windows. And while there's plenty of strategy to battle it doesn't come with a ton of buttons or commands, just ways in which the systems interact. It's a clean and intelligent design from top to bottom which makes the game a pleasure to work through.The story picks up the charm and runs with it, going with a tone that's just self-aware enough to ellicit a few chuckles but never enough to pull you out of the game entirely. Chatting with characters is always fun for their unique voices and takes on the fantastic world, though be prepared for a little awkwardness that seems to stem from translation. It does a lot with traditional fantasy tropes that keeps the journey fresh, and there's a wealth of side quests that are both fun and include some unexpected surprises.King's Bounty is a fantastic fantasy adventure but does suffer a bit from being the first entry in its series. My big gripe with the game was trying to keep armies together, as casualties suffered in battle are only addressed easily by going back and recruiting more of the unit you had. This can be a real pain if you're relying on a specific strategy. In my case, I married (yes you can do this) a pirate captain who gave me huge bonuses to pirate units, and so I rolled with a privateer posse for most of the game. Every time I lost a bunch of buccaneers, though, I had to go all they way back to the islands to get more. Eventually I literally depopulated the world of pirates, and had to move on to other units which left my pirate wife mostly useless. You'll get more mileage out of planning for a dynamic army, but keeping it staffed is always going to be an issue.That's really all I have to say against it, though. My adventure took over 20 hours and I still didn't see everything there was to see, and outside a few out-of-depth fights it was an absolute joy to experience. The bright, colorful graphics echo the cheery tone of the game and the sound design matches it just as well. There are three characters and four difficulties to choose at the start, and beating the game unlocks a mess more characters if you want to stick with it forever. And that's not such a bad idea, because there's a lot of charm to experience in this fanciful title.			",488,212,8,71,62,7,65

												This game reminded me a lot of FInal Fantasy Tactis in the way battles unfold, however, this time each unit is not alone, they are armies of troops.  It takes a bit of learning at the start, getting used to the battle system, but once you get the hang of it, fighting becomes more tactical and strategic.  You can't just all out fight the enemies in this game or you will lose fairly quickly.This is one of the few games though that can actually punish you if you are losing a fight.  The fewer troops you have to deal damage, the less damage the enemies will incur.  One thing I would have liked to see however is some way of retreating from a fight without losing all your troops.  Maybe if it was just a % rather than all of them.You have to manage your money or you could find yourself like I did many hours into the game and out of funds to hire more troops.  This can be a bad thing but it forces you to think before you act a lot more.Towards the end of the game I did find it got pretty repetitive, but overall a very enjoyable experience.  I recommend this to any strategy RPG vet.			",9,2,0,21,6,0,6

												Probably my most favourite strategy games of all times and I've played them all. Thanks to King's Bounty I found a new joy of playing videogames again. On the surface it's a HOMAM ripoff of course but beneath it it's got so much more life, vibrancy, sparkle and  new ideas than the ever more listless iterations of HOMAM it has completely overshadowed its old teacher. The Legend, and especially it's perfected sequel Armored Princess, boasts THE best and most enjoyable tactical HOMAM-like combat of all games ever made, no contest.Unfortunately the publisher decided to milk the series dry and came up with two more sequels, Warriors of the North and Dark Side. Both games have the same exact engine with very few innovations. They're basically glorified custom campaings made in the Map Editor. The sparkle and magic are mostly gone and what we got was lifeless, dull grind, designed without much care or thought, probably by just a fragment of the original team (or maybe just a few interns), just to squeeze a few more dollars from the franchise. Avoid at all costs (Warriors of the North is still passable if you become a KB addict but definitelly avoid Dark Side).But the first two games are unambiguously great, full of with and playful brilliance, and will forever remain in my heart.

												I'm fan of Heroes of Might and Magic series and I feel same about Disciples. To be honest, until recently I got a chance to play King's Bounty: The Legend and I was surprised about it - even tho it can be compared to those two games, map exploration is really different in this one. I won't complain, running around is fun, and so fighting is, quests aren't so boring. There is just one thing that will make King's Bounty to be on my list after masterpieces like HoMM and Disciples games - it's not really memorable. I will probably remember forever units and factions from mentioned games, maps, scenarious and such, but in King's Bounty: The Legend? Not really. Still, if you are fan of this kind of games you will have great fun playing it, as I had and will have, since I didn't managed to finish it yet. This game is big, after 15 hours I feel like I didn't discovered and haven't done much. That's a good thing. Whole franchise is getting sale many times in whole year, so wait for discount and try it - that's if you enjoy turn-based battles mixed with strategy and rpg.			",1737,715,60,244,224,20,321

Absolute Gem Do you like Heroes of Might and Magic? If you answered yes, buy every game in this f'ing series. This game is a tactical RPG that is purely fun. Not punishing or forcing you to rush. You can explore the map and build your hero up bit by bit at your own casual pace. You can recruit interesting monsters via quests and put together your own favorite army strategies. Think of it as HoMM without the stress and much deeper characters and storyline. My only complaint would be that you end up doing a lot of fetch quests and backtracking, but the map isn't that big, and you'll always welcome the chance to get back to town and top off your army again, since you're in no hurry, and being inefficient is not punished. No rush, go ahead and be ocd. Visit every corner of the map, walk all the way back to get one more bear because you leveled up and can now get more, go ahead and run away from a battle and abandon your army, here's 6k gold to buy more! Oh and BTW, that enemy death stack you lost to, any casualties you inflicted in your failed attempt are persistent. When you roll up on them again, they'll be much easier. Just one of the few games that understands gamers want to take their time and explore all the game content, not be poked and prodded through it and punished for not doing it efficiently. I bought this game for $1.75 on sale, and it's one of the most fun games I've ever played.			",22,8,0,23,7,0,14

												500~ hours and 8 or 9 playthroughs later I figured I should write a review of this series. The first 3 modern King's Bounty games give you the same Heroes of Might and Magic formula that New World invented with the original King's Bounty back in 1990. This is King's Bounty bigger, better, and more complex than ever. As good as HOMM3, and an instant classic. If you aren't enamored of the first 3 (KB, Crossworlds, and WOTN) then definitely avoid the stuff released after them, as the series has slid downhill rapidly starting around WOTN. Sad to see, but at least we got some seriously good HOMM style games out of this run.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Just beginning to scratch the surface of this game. Neat combination of money management and army availability. The guys you add to your army are limited so don't let them die too easy. Again, I'm just starting so I bet there'll be others to replace them in the future as time goes on in the game.			",29,13,4,21,37,0,44

I hadn't heard of the developer when it came out so I balked. I finally grabbed this on sale and I should have got it years ago.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Small in scope, but surprisingly addicting. My biggest complaint is actually that it's too damn long. With no variation in battlefield size, you get tired of the same setup over and over. The overworld is fun and filled with treasure and easter eggs to discover but every battle goes to the same map. The combat itself is a bit simple but fun, if only the fun lasted till the end of the game.A pretty good value though, especially if on sale. I've put a good amount of time into this.

												If you like the older Heroes of Might and Magic series you will most likely love this gem.There are some key differences I had to think hard about if I liked or not (well, still am actually).1. Everything if finite - that means army, gold, quests etc. I was slightly worried about this in the beginning but as the game progress and you unlock more and more places to buy armies this seems like it is going to be less of an issue. Everything is randomized which is good and bad - so that nice recruitment place you had before with 1100 royal snakes are now selling peasants or zombie birds.2. Story-driven. HoMM-series are straight buildarmy and smash; this one has lots of small RPG elements mixed in. I really like but I guess this can swing both ways.3. Upgrading items via special quests, awesome side-quests and seemingly great stories/quests - what is not to like about that :).I had this from an earlier humble bundle purchase and was pure luck I tried it out - I'm glad I did - I cannot emphasize enough that if you liked the homm serieis - and you have this, or see it cheap somewhere, give it try!

												Fun and very approachable.  Decent storyline, and a very good characterization of all the people you meet.  Very playable in its own right.  The RPG elements are easy to grasp, and battles are within the control of the player to both initiate, evade, and fight through.  Intel regarding potential engagements are very helpful to gauge whether a battle can be committed to, but there seems to be a very fine line between battles that are too easy, and just too hard.  Graphics are simple, but wonderful to play with - simple and eyepopping.However, if you are looking for a very deep tactical experience, best look elsewhere.  The tactical decisions only delve down to the third or fourth level of sophistication.  Each tactical battlefied is the same size, with only a few obstacles and chests (or third party threats) to navigate.  Each ""army"" (it's on a scale of army, not individual) has a few options beyond the basic of move, attack, use item, and cast spell.Great game, but I'm just looking for more turn-based goodness in a deeper tactical environment.  Recommended.			",11,4,0,5,1,0,3

												Fans of the PC Classic ""Heroes of Might and Magic"" (almost any of the sequels will do) will instantly feel at home with this game which is a very positive statement to make right off the bat. KB: The Legend is the first title in a series that now runs four single player titles and satisfyingly mixes RTS and RPG elements to create an engaging game that may be a little too long for its own good. Graphics are adequate, as are the sound effects while the music, gameplay and depth are pretty good.The game is played by controlling an avatar that can be one of three classes standard role playing classes; Warrior, Mage or Paladin. The hero gallops across area maps fighting mobs of creatures, visiting towns, talking to people and gathering quests while also advancing through a storyline that involves saving the world.Storyline and dialogue are standard fare with no big surprises or stand-out characters in fact by the end of the game you may get a little tired of all the fetch quests if you've participated in the majority of the 100+ quests in the game. It's the depth of combat and the amount of characters available which give the game its high points but even this can wear thin after a while.The avatar gains levels and power which offer powerful boosts to the troops and also expands on the avatar’s spells or rage summons that add extra flavor to offense or defense. The various kinds of troops that can be obtained do a good job of keeping things fresh but by the end every creature will have been fought numerous times so even though you haven’t personally used the creatures in your own army, you’ll be well aware of what they are capable of. It’s turn based and hex grid combat with a wide bunch of things to do. However, like in most games that can last 40+ hours, eventually combat will start to feel stale or at least it did for me. So in all the game is very solid and enjoyable to play for the most part but I’ll definitely have to take a break before I rush off to play the other games in the series.7/10 ",249,78,0,93,10,1,20

First and most important, the army is not limitless! You have to manage your tactics and your troops carefully in order to survive!Second, there is much more roleplaying than HOMM. Quests and subquests will devour your time and you will actually not get bored!Third, its a unified world you can travel and not just maps having to rebuild from scratch every darn time!All and all, its a game you must have (along with the HOMM collection)			",880,608,21,170,142,9,212

												The game is similar to Heroes of Might and Magic, and for those of you who don't know that franchise, the game lets you command up to 5 stacks of units on the battlefield. You, the hero, don't take part in battles personally, but you assist your army through casting spells and giving your army bonuses.The game is good, and like HoMM, it relies on the fantasy and mythical setting containing magical creatures like griffins, ogres, dragons and unicorns, along with the traditional races humans, dwarves, elves and orcs.A major problem is the constant need to backtrack because you need to replenish your troops after a few battles, which can get really tedious throughout the game.But overall it is a nice strategy game.

												Do you like tactical role playing games with no fuss and a lot of depth? Then you should get King's Bounty. Let me tell you why.King's Bounty: The Legend is a reboot of a game property that was made in 1990. Drawing from the gameplay aspects of the original title, and combining it with modern graphics, a friendly interface, and some new game elements, King's Bounty: The Legend ends up being an enjoyable and polished experience. You'll do everything from treasure hunting to tactical combat, and along the way you'll need to delve into some resource management and thoughtful strategy if you want to be successful. This game does not sport some overly complex, epic story or narrative, nor should it, since its simplistic presentation is (in my opinion) part of its charm.Bottom line: this is a game that will not disappoint those who are interested in the tactical RPG genre. When I first played it upon release, even I was pleasantly surprised, and I had played the original back when I was a kid. Overall, the game is a reminder that developers do not need to reinvent the wheel everytime they set out to make a good game. The formula in this title is old, but the experience itself is fresh and organic. Highly recommended.			",210,34,1,41,27,0,44

												It's a cool game, but for some reason there will frequently be a very strong battle mixed in with all the others, and there doesn't really seem to be a way to tell which ones are like that, aside from getting your army wiped out (and considering dead units can't come back, once you run out of stock you can't buy more, that's kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥.) Also the ""tutorial"" is worthless, you need to figure out everything on your own. I had to google how to use rage because I couldn't figure it out. Turns out you can't use it till you complete a certain quest, though the game tells you you can use it to summon stuff right off the bat...This game is too long. It never ends. It's just battle after battle, same♥♥♥♥♥♥constantly all game. 62 hours in and I think I'm a bit more than half way. I don't often say this about a game, but it needs to be shorter.

												It's a fantastic round-based strategy game. The game is challenging and the story is ok.The best thing in this game is the possibility to adjust your army as the game goes on. You start with rather weak humans and animals and as you conquer new region, you get access to stronger humans and animals but also dwarves, elves, undeads, demons and orks. The other thing I like is the skill tree of your hero. Depending on your class, you will have to decide which of the other classes' skills you want to skip (at least on hard).The fighting system might be similar to the Heroes of Might and Magic Games, but the rest of the game definitely isn't. You only have one hero, no towns but multiple castles and taverns to recruit units and - probably most important - you cannot have an arbitrary number of units in one stack, they are limited by your leadership.However, there is still room for improvements which is shown in the other King's Bounty games like Armored Princess.9/10			",23,8,2,33,5,1,29

When you have to reinforce your lost units after a tough battle, sometimes you have to walk back all the way to the beginning to reinforce your troops.

												I really love this game. It's like the missions where you don't have a castle in Heroes of Might and Magic games, only much more fun. It takes place in a fantasy world that seems generic at first, but a healthy dose of humor and irony (and bad translations from Russian) set it apart from the rest. And some quests and artifacts you'll encounter are definitely not generic!Gameplay-wise, you'll be mostly wandering around beautifully detailed areas, collecting loot, avoiding high-level baddies and looking for fights you can take on so you can level up, and so on. The fights themselves are a beautiful tactical affair, you're always trying to minimize losses and to make the best of troops you can hire locally (some people insist on making long back and forth trips to replenish troops instead of working with what they have, I think it's a fun-killer). There area many spells and special abilities to spice things up.The only criticism I would have is that later areas of the game can be very difficult especially if you didn't make a very good character build, and there are less fun quests to lighten things up. Latter areas are also less well-designed. Overall though, you have a lot of liberty for the order in which you want to tackle the late game challenges, and finishing the game was satisfying despite having taken two year-long breaks.Highly recommended!

												This is a great ""old school"" RPG that combines running around a map in real-time with turn-based combat on a hex grid. Though there are many side quests, the main quest line is linear. Still, it is well written and doesn't feel sandboxed. There is a good amount of resource management and a lot to keep you interested through 90 hours of play. My paladin ended up marrying a demon, which was way cool. Medium difficulty was plenty challenging. Got it for 5 bucks and so recommended!

												Excellent game, very colorful, I can see a lot of effort and care was put into the game.Mind you, I never played the original New World's Computing King's Bounty, so I have no idea if it's as good as this one.But I can tell you, the game is worth every cent, and right now its super cheap, so if you are a fan of Heroes of Might and Magic game but with more roleplay elements, then I fully recommend it.Pros-Colorful eyecandy graphics, very detailed world-3 classes to choose, and countless different strategies to play each time, so it's replayable-the game rewards you well for the completed quests-high score to keep track of your score and trying to improve on each of your run-lots of quests and side quests-rich with humor-lots of units to choose from-No major difficuilty spikesCons-Some minor glitches might get you stuck-frame drops happen very rarely but they happen, probably depends on your graphic card-one of the biggest cons of this game is backtracking. When you have to reinforce your lost units after a tough battle, sometimes you have to walk back all the way to the beginning to reinforce your troops. It turns into busywork later in the gameIt gets an 8.5/10 from me.			",124,6,4,15,3,3,15

												This game is a fun twist on the Heroes Of Might & Magic formula. Of course, the original King's Bounty was the precursor to HOMM. However, The Legend, is much different from the original. King's Bounty: The Legend plays out much more like an RPG while the others are strategy games. In The Legend, you only have one hero and he is the official Treasure Collector for the kingdom. As such, he is sent on many quests helping both royalty and the peasants and even the creatures of the land. There is no town building. Combat, however, is almost identical to HOMM.

												Would I recommend this game? No. Why? Because the next games in this series (Armoured Princess) is better. They both basically work almost the same way with the same mechanics but Armoured Princess is less brutally unbalanced.The trouble with this game is that your resources are finite and as such it forces you to always play conservatively. No Zerg rushes here, you ideally want to win every battle with zero loses. If you've ever wondered what a pyrrhic victory is, this game will teach you because it's all too easy to win a battle, but be so crippled that the game is essentially unplayable. There is no way to ""farm"" more gold and it likely wouldn't matter anyway since (with few exception) the number of units available to buy is limited and you'll run out eventually anyway.So what happens? You spend most of you time running around the various maps trying to pick off the weakest stacks that you can kill with out too many loses. You'll spend more time bravely running away than actually fighting.Now the same is true of Armoured Princess, but the difference is in this game, even on the first map, there are stacks you won't be able to handle until much later. So you run from map to map, picking off units, running back (sometimes way back) to restock your troops, hitting a solid wall of way overpowered stacks and then backtracking to see if any of the previously too strong stacks are now managable. It really kills your momentum, drags out the game and makes it feel really grindy. Despite the fact that most people would associate ""farming"" as grinding this game has found a completely different way to be grindy.			",462,206,18,76,65,6,92

												Plays surprisingly like the original King's Bounty minus having to pay your troops a monthly income or carry out contracts (added in the sequel). The biggest problem with this game is the fact that you can royaly screw yourself over and make the game unwinnable if you don't play your cards right. You absolutely must aim for zero casualties in the first half of the game or you'll spend too much money replacing troops and then not have any gold for the powerful units later.I also can't recommend this to anyone who isn't a true tactician, the battles start to become longer and more drawn out as the game progresses and it only takes a few losses to make the rest of the game too difficult to win.

Might & Magic Heroes done Right [KAMGUSTA's REVIEW]Good graphics, good music, great gameplay, great longevity, great price! What do you want more?Contrary to Heroes, where you use different heroes each with different abilities, here you will only use one hero and you choose what abilities to develop.In Heroes the movement on the map is turn based, here is in real time (so you don't have to wait for the CPU phase). Don't worry: combat is still done in the old-fashioned turn-based way ;) .In Heroes you are against enemy kingdoms, here you will wander around the map doing different quests (from attacking a castle, to defending it, to helping some farmers, to just collect allies, and so on).In a simple phrase: what Might & Magic Heroes should have been.I spent hours playing it (and I don't have finished it yet!) and I recommend it heartly to anyone who loves, like me, turn-based RPGs.Best played with MouseRecommended Buy Price < 20$Score 9/10 ",1070,371,47,135,109,8,186

The game is more story and quest driven than the Heroes series making the character development more personal and integral to gameplay. Basic choices in quests result in various rewards with a large number of creatures, spells and lovely colourful graphics. A game you'll keep coming back to.			",255,51,4,82,52,8,104

												This is an incredibly fun an addicting game. It's a turn based RPG where you move around in real time within the world (unlike the Heroes of Might and Magic series) and when you get into combat your troops are on a hex field and you move them around (like the Heroes of Might and Magic series).There are quite a few different types of troops which made the game really fun. As you progress through the game you get introduced to these new troops which really keeps the game fresh.You also have some hero customization as well as three different skill trees you can specialize in. While it's not as indepth as some other RPGs it does provide a fair bit of enjoyement. The only bad thing about this game is there are some quests that are fairly pointless. For example some quests will have you go simply talk to people and that's it. No combat, no special event, nothing. I think the game could do without those.Overall this is a great game and definitely worth the purchase.			",200,72,6,57,13,2,57

												If you like stories and strategic battles and quests then you'll probably love this combination of RPG and turn-based strategy. It is very similar to Heroes of might and magic 3 (and 5) but instead of campaign and your own castles you have here quests and spirits that help you during battles. And in expansions you have your own magical pet dragon :) This is one of the games that have this ""just one more turn"" feeling.			",107,46,8,19,23,2,31

												One of the best value, quality games in my library <3 There are loads of possible strategies with different units, and no two battles are the same. It's also often challenging finding the right balance of units for your character, which is a good thing. The game's really long and each environment is so pretty and amazing. You can tell a lot of detail and effort went into this. I love the humour and pisstake on fairytale/fantasy archetypes too.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A long time ago I thought to myself: ""I LOVE Heroes of Might and Magic, it's a shame I have to wait for other people to take their turn..."" Well not anymore! I first purchased Kings Bounty in disc form years back, had a blast and then forgot about it untill Hurricane Sandy trashed my disc (and others...goodbye Neverwinter Nights...) untill the Steam Winter Sale, also known as ""Merry Christmas to Me!"" That being said, if you enjoy building an army, casting spells, hex grid combat, and goofy humor, but DON'T enjoy sharing, taking turns via hotseat, or waiting in online lobbies for a game, THIS is the game for you!

												I played the original King's Bounty on the Sega Genesis a LOT.  It was one of those games with random spawning treasure and monsters; the castle's were always in the same place but the villains inside of them would randomize on new games.I was happy to see a new one; and bought it.  I actually bought this game twice; the first time was on disk which I lost.  This second time it was on sale.  If you like the genre, get it.  It's not groundbreaking, but it's fun.

												King's Bounty The Legend is an awesome alternative to Heroes of Might and Magic. It has very cute graphics and animation, the story is intriguing and the gameplay is more than appealing.To really enjoy and appreciate the depth of King's Bounty's universe you need to be prepared to read a lot of text. By a lot, I mean A LOT. Everyone seems more then eager to share his/ her/ it life story with you and, for most of the part, the semi-monologues are quite interesting. You get to choose what to ask and whether you accept or decline a quest. Not a single line of it is voiced, so you're left with reading. It's really not that bad, though I wish that the translation (from Russian) was done better.Also, the gameplay mechanics can be quite fun and you'll often find yourself exploring every single pixel on the map looking for runes/ gold to make you powerful or to simply enjoy the beautiful landscapes. You have complete freedom of movement while you're on the map but you are restricted while			",1928,780,68,252,241,17,344

												I really enjoyed this game. I loved the old Heroes of Might and Magic games and the combat system is very similar but you don't maintain the towns. It made it harder to get that perfect group comp, sometimes you were more limited. I enjoyed the choices and found myself using almost every unit in the game at one point or another. This also made strategy/spells that much more important to preserve a troop type you really enjoy. Definitely worth trying if you enjoyed the classic HOMM games.			",653,240,20,131,73,7,173

												I still remember playing the original King's Bounty by New World Computing eons ago...and being completely beaten by ghosts, who would destroy all my troops while multiplying in numbers. Luckily this new incarnation doesn't feature such game-breaking enemies, insteading refining a turn-based strategy RPG system that makes it at once satisfying and addictive. While the storyline is forgettable, you'll lose hours sucked in by its gripping gameplay. Definitely recommended. 8/10			",217,115,2,36,11,2,15

												I highly recommend this game to anyone who was a fan of the Heroes of Might and Magic series, or any other old school, turned-based strategy RPGs. The art direction is great, making for a vibrant and engaging world with all kinds of locations from small tropical islands inhabited by pirates to great Orc fortresses in the white mountains to the north. This is one of those games where I have often found myself playing it at 3am after several on a work night and wondering ""where the hell did all that time go"". Buy this game and it's sequel, Armored Princess.			",161,16,2,26,14,0,41

												Developers have a really nice sense of humour :) The game makes you smile quite often. Combat system is amazing, reminds me of good old Heroes of M&M in a good way. The world is interesting to explore.The only flaw is movement. My character gets stuck, trying to run through a wall or barrel sometimes (though it is possible that it's just my ""talent"" to control the hero that causes such problems).Overall, the game is worth playing. It is balanced and captivating.			",73,28,0,24,6,3,16

												Lots to do & explore. (7/10)The game reminds me of the old Heroes of Might and Magic games, except with quests.The game is fun for the strategy involved and its exploration. There's some tedium, but it doesn't dissuade from the motivation of completing quests & getting stronger.Pros:-Battles are fairly well balanced. You won't lose most, but you'll take heavy casualties without forethought.-The graphics are nice & well-thought out. You walk on sand; dust plumes. Walk on gold, gold scatters.-Music is nice. It's not monotonous.-Lots of items.-Lots of quests.-Lots of spells.-Several modes of transportation.-Different battlefields. While most are the same, obstacles can prompt strategic thought.Cons:-Side quests lack continuity with the main story line. You'll see these people once, and never hear from them again.-Huge amount of reading for non-consequential stories.-Skill tree doesn't provide meaningful skills. They're helpful, but there aren't many game-changing skills.-Camera Mod preferable. The camera is pretty limiting. There's a mod that provides better angles and distance.-Text is small, & sometimes poorly formatted. Again, there's a mod for this.-No quick travel. You lose troops. You need to refill them. Travel 4 zones to replace the same type troop.-Some timed quests without notification of timer.-Low motivation for replay.-Bugs. There are a few bugs in the game (such as incompletable quests), but none are game-breaking (as I know).While I complain about long stories, they are detailed and entertaining. I just wish there were consequences for your choices.I've only played one class, but replayability seems low. There are 3 different classes, each with a defining ability. You could try them out; maybe use different troops or a different difficulty setting. However the story won't change.Aside from that I would say it’s worth its current price of $6.99. I’d buy the 3-pack though. Get yourself some different stories at a discount price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Wow, this is a lot more polished and atmospheric then I thought from 1C. Interesting Heroes of Might and Magic style hex based combat. You have troops, spells, and a hero. The main hero isn't in combat, but has spells to assist the troops, and items which confer stats and such to the troops/ determine how many troops available. Great writing, graphics have aged very nicely. The tutorial is a bit bare bones, but to be fair I've barely gone past it. Wish I would have touched on this earlier, been in my backlog for ages.

King's Bounty: The Legend brings the franchise back, keeping the fun, turn-based fights intact, while upping the ante with well done 3-D graphics, an enjoyable music score, and loads of major and minor quests to undertake. Tack on the difficulty settings that can make the game accessible to beginners, while offering the more seasoned players a solid challenge, and you've got a fine rebirth for the King's Bounty franchise.A-			",737,80,35,51,26,4,19

The lack of of turn-based movement and resource management makes for a faster pace and an easier-to-approach experience for newcomers, while still offering enough tactical depth to keep genre veterans hooked, too.The Legend, along with the rest of the new King's Bounty franchise built upon its back, is worthy of being mentioned on the same page as classics like Heroes of Might & Magic III and Disciples 2.

												The Heroes of Might and Magic franchise was originally started on a black and white turn-based game called King's Bounty.  It featured much similar combat to teh HoMM franchise, but had RPG-like quest missions.  The revivied King's Bounty series took a LOt of what was right about teh idea and revivied teh RPg aspect, making this in many ways superior to some o fteh turn-based HoMM sequels.  There are rough edges, and some of those are smoothed in King's Bounty: Armoured Princess.  Still, you will find yourself enjoying this game, even if teh first playthrough you might find yourself pinched on resources.  Learning to abandon some of your favorite armies and pick up new ones is key, and teh randomization of some spells -- some of which are truly crucial -- can lend to a little bit opf frustration.  But believe me: This is great fun, and the game is extraordinarily engaging.			",698,519,9,209,86,9,182

												I played this game and loved it,  so I did all the wives in it. Even the frog one.  Things I don't like about it is that after some time you can get to ""xp/power"" wall by AI and then I had to grind around it, either by gaining xp on other places or go around and around. I might come back to it eventualy to finish it, story is nice and interesting and yet sometimes to slow.Good game. Had my fare share of it.			",731,383,22,85,95,8,125

												Enjoyed the little bit of the game I played. Got burnt out on the battles, they were very similar all the time. Some of the areas didn't seem very balanced but from what I can tell this was the original title and it is a bit dated. Hopefully Armored Princess and Crossworlds played better. Familiar, unique and casual crunched into one. Scoop it on a sale and try it out.Would probably rate this in the middle everything considered.			",35,2,0,9,2,0,5

												This is the best Heroes of Might and Magic-alike that you can get your hands on.  I love how inventive all the troops are, different armies suggest different strategies, and I like how the game forces you to keep changing out troops by only having so many available to hire.  It forces you to find the strategies, as opposed to just something you might do on your own like in another game.Add to this tons of invention in the plot--not the main plot, that is dull as dishwater, but in everything that happens on the way there, from zombie brides to Pinnocchio like whales, there's always something unexpected around the corner.My only negative is that at the end of it all, it's ruined me for the genre, I just can't get into other HOMM-likes now because i've just spent so gosh darn long on this one.  And none of the others seem to have quite this level of imagination.			",142,142,1,44,18,1,48

												Its the original Heroes of Might & Magic.  Its a long and very big game.  Its pretty linear gameplay and linear story line.  Its not a revolution by any means.  Its even paced, decent story.  If you like the strategy turn based RPG's, you'll like this.  Consider a mage class, its probably the best to play through with.			",134,34,3,37,7,2,41

												In many ways, King's Bounty is a step forward regarding the combat aspect for turn-based games. But barring this, Katauri Interactive's latest creation is nothing more than an RPG in which the only hero evolves in terms of basic genre principles that are already set in stone. The AI is decent enough, the combat is not bad. However, it does becomes boring afterawhile.			",119,51,1,44,29,2,55

												Wow, simply incredible.  I just finished one of the best games I've ever played.  This is what Disciples 3 and HOMM5 should have aspired to.  I don't even know where to start.  The game is beautiful, even with aliasing turned off on my aging rig, both visually and the stories it weaves with a fantastic sense of humor.  Combat is clearly based on the aforementioned IPs but boasts and impressive list of units with unique and tactically significant abilities and traits.  Leveling my hero was addictive to the point of insanity and I could scarcely stop playing long enough for basic hygeine.  I highly recommend this to anyone regardless of their preferred gaming genres.  And to think, I picked up the whole series on a steam sale for less than 7 dollars!  Please play this game!!!

												KB:TL Is a fantastic hybrid of RPG, turn-based strategy, and exploration.  The game takes so many twists and turns both in story and strategy, its hard to stop playing.  Its also very epic... I would estimate 80-100 hours to finish if you fully explore the world and do all the side quests.  I've only completed one island of 4 and I'm 25 hours along.  I would call this a ""casual game"" for chess / rpg enthusiasts... or for those Dragon Age players who love to pause and think through battles.  We're a different breed, and this game is for us.

												King's Bounty: The Legend suffers from a massive lack of cleavage, something the developer was quick to remedy in the sequel, King's Bounty: Armored Princess, a game which features a hero with a distinct dearth of armor compared to the dude here, who unfortunately has his entire chest covered. Luckily this game makes up for it by having lots of bright, shiny colors, which push it halfway to Acid Tripsylvania. The ridiculous narrative pushes it the rest of the way there, and in fact King's Bounty: The Legend is probably the best evidence we have for the hypothesis that Russia went completely nuts after it lost the Cold War.

												Ranging from slightly off-beat to downright mad, King's Bounty does not seem like a serious strategy game. But the tactical gameplay is tightly composed, varied and often quite brutal. Units are a limited resource such that when your most rare and powerful allies fall in battle you are not simply losing money and time. You feel like you are truly losing soldiers, losing pieces of your finely tuned army such that it must soon be redesinged and rebuilt around new tactics.King's Bounty is turn-based tactical battling at it's finest. Like a more complex and inelegant form of chess, it can be played casually or seriously. I highly recommend it. Besides, how many games require you to engage in a mystical battle for supremacy everytime you upgrade one of your magical items? I've lost half an army to my damn equipment without successfully improving it's function just yet ... and I wouldn't have things any other way.			",225,72,6,32,23,5,44

												As some one whose never been able to get into the heroes of might and magic games (despite numerous attempts) I was leary of this game which was often described as a low budget version of said series.  Despite that, for some reason, I gave this game a chance... and was NOT disapointed.  A perfect game this is not, its randomly generated aspects often resulting in games that can be relatively easy, or absurdly difficult, depending on how the RNG feels on that given day, and being a particularly long game (my own hours logged are from my one and only playful) you'd have to be pretty obsessed with the game (or just not have anything else to play) to take advantage of the various elements clearly intended to encourage multiple play throughs.  Yet, while I only played through the game once, and did get unlucky in some of the randomness, it all didn't matter, because the game is just plain fun.To me the key to this game was in the unpunished (often rewarded) exploration.  Too many turn based games kind of force you to always be doing something relevant on any given turn, but here, outside of battle, unless you're going for a speed run or high score, you can blissfully wander around the map at your leisure, just enjoying the sights, dodging creatures well beyond you're current ability, and stealing items you have no business having that early in the game.  And because of the way leadership works, you constantly feel like you've gotten stronger and accomplished something meaningful when you find a new leadership flag, instead of just when you level up.All in all this was a very rewarding an enjoyable experience that, while not with out its flaws, I woudl absolutely recommend to anyone who doesn't mind a little bit a difficulty and loves to explore.

												An interesting game and has all the feel of king's bounty or heroes of might and magic, but hard to get past the bad design.One example of the bad design is that there are limited amount of troops available to hire and they're often all the way across the world.  So the game sometimes plays out like this:1.) Progress in the storyline and either lose some troops or level up (and get capacity for more troops).  Now you're at 60 archers when you could have 100.  you need the 100 to really be competitive.2.) Travel all the way back across the world to get your 40 extra archers.3.) Travel all the way back across the world to get to the next quest.4.) Fight the next quest and either lose some troops or level up (and get capacity for more troops).  Now you're at 90 / 120 archers.5.) Travel all the way back across the world only to find that there are no more archers to hire.There is some fun to be had with the game, but you'll spend 2/3 of your playtime shuttling troops to-and-fro instead of actually playing the game.  Mechanics like this make me not recommend the game... but if you have the stomach for this kind of thing then you could pick it up and have some fun.			",22,9,0,13,1,0,21

												The game moves a bit too slowly for me, and there is very little strategy outside of the (slow) combat system. My favorite aspect of strategy games is their inherently open-ended nature. Will you focus on crippling the enemy's economy, or engage them directly. King's Bounty offers none of that...it is a mostly linear RPG, which is fine, but as an RPG, it doesn't really have interesting development of the characters. Most of the choices made are subtle differences at best.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I tried hard to like this game. I really, REALLY did. I played for roughly 25 hours, and it never got fun. -The battles were frustrating, since the computer gives an insanely large edge to the tactics of it's own troops. They will get to go dead last on a turn, and first on the next turn. They will ""wait"" to act before I tell my troops to wait (specifically to let the enemies move within range), but my characters will be forced to act first. -Ridiculously overpowered enemies/quests will be interspersed in the beginning areas, so you'll get a quest but won't be able to complete it for 6 more character levels.-Money is over-abundant but runes are nonexistant.-You can actually run out of troops to resupply your army with.-Everything is pre-determined before battles. If you re-load a game and enter a battle again, the enemies will move to the exact same squares, and EVERY unit will do the exact same amount of damage when you attack.This isn't strategy, it's rote memorization.

												There is a difference... Some skills have changed, you have to earn two additional slots for troops, you're a ""male"" character, the map is different, and the storyline is as well. Sadly, that is all. The music, controls, graphics, skill outline - it's all the identical twin to the original and the ""expansion."" This would have been fantastic if it were joined with the original game, allowing the different story and male character to be selected at the beginning. OH! There's a vocal intro, but it doesn't put anything to shame. Sadly, I still have to suggest - do not purchase or play unless you're a die-hard fan of the strategy style chess-move games and if you (for some unknown reason) find this series a total knock-out.

												This is missing everything that makes a turn based RPG just that.  No way to farm XP, you can actually run out of gold and troop in late game and have no way to move forward in the game.  I played it for a couple of days and after awhile I got tired of having to hire troop all the time and reading that you want to try to never lose any at all to win the game, naaaa, not for me.

												Not very impressed with gameplay on this iteration of the game.  The UI is clunky and the new, rich graphics don't mess with nearly detailess maps.  No important NPC's are marked, making it tedious to follow quest chains unless you're really trying to visually memorize things.  They do offer the ability to tag things, but that's like buying furniture you have to assemble yourself.  That was the killer.  Maps were useless and graphics actually detracted from the game, which is turn based combat.  Overall it's okay.   I love the strategy aspects and think they could have put their money into better battle graphics and not overly populated scenery.			",6,2,0,9,2,0,5

												This is my first negative review since I installed Steam and it pains me to do so. I bought this game because I'm a fan of the ""Heroes of Might & Magic"" series, so that's my point of comparison. The lack of movement restraint felt great in ""KB"", the rotating camera is fine and the way you expand your army is OK. But this game lacks a decent story (at least until I gave up playing it, after almost 10 hours), there's a lot of backtracking and, worst of all, combat is very bad. I played as a Paladin on Normal difficulty, but the game is extremely easy and doesn't require much strategy. Levelling up and customizing your character's ability trees are not very enticing, either. In a nutshell, I got bored and didn't want to play anymore. It's not a revoltingly bad game, it's just not interesting or challenging enough to be worthy of my time. Now I wonder if I should play ""Armored Princess"" and ""Crossworlds"" (I got them in a bundle with this one)...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												King's Bounty is the poor cousin to Heroes of Might and Magic.  It's a turn based strategy game with bright graphics and wonderful music. The storyline and writing are average at best and the gameplay is repetitive and soon becomes dull.  Take note this game is NOT an rpg as some other reviewers have stated.  There is no roleplay in this game outside of choosing between which of the 3 classes you wish to play.  All conversations with NPC's are circular and come down to either accepting or declining a quest.  With xp being a premium commodity you do not wish to refuse any quests.The sudden spikes in gameplay challenge can only be described as unbalanced.   You seemingly walk over battles with ease or they are overly difficult.   The latter may not be such a problem if your army's troops were easily replenished but as there is a limited number of troops for purchase it can you leave your hero weak and unable to progress.  To progress smoothly through this game you cannot afford to take any losses from battles.Whilst this game is cheap, don't waste your money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I had my speakers off by the time I made it out of tutorial. meybe this would be breath taking in the 80s but its 2015 graphics- 9/10 about the only thing that had me, the beauty of playing a cellphone game in standard graphics. I'd prefer if they would have put more into other things. writing - 5/10 I've seen better lore and ingame script from toilet paper. I know this is a 1$ game but put something better in it or dont have it at all. I wanted to start my character a nameless warrior and ended up a nameless treasure gatherer who apearently had a name because i failed the beginning of the tutorial because i didnt know hpw to play the game. overall- 4/10 at least it will age better than an assasins creed game. just another title to fill up my list of unplayed games.

												A rather ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. I bought it for 1$ but wouldn't play it even if it were free. Waste of time. After 10+hours the hope of it getting better at some point, ran out. Creatures are lazy and uninspired. Spiders, octupuses, bears wolves... A 12 year old has a better imagination. Art style is very cartoonish and childish. Sort of like comparing Dota 2 and league of legends. Nothing that would fit into a tv show or a movie, only a cratoon for children under 12. Creatures/character are very unrealistic, cheesy and unbeliveable. Very little to no immersion. Humour and qests are on a whole another level of cheesy and dumb. Some of the (russian) developers that made this game worked on Space Rangers, which was the only game russian video game industry has ever produced that was any good. However, these people have tried to immitate the humor of space rangers here and the result was some dumb unispired underage♥♥♥♥♥♥ I wouldn't play this crappy game even if it were free.

												This one tries very hard to be innovative, but unfortunately all those the good ideas are lumped together into very poor gameplay. It took me very long to understand the basic principles of battle, which are so fundamentally different from Heroes Of Might & Magic that I was surprised (as it looks like  a clone). Sadly, the gameplay is not fun for me. It got tedious and boring after 20 minutes, and I will return to playing Heroes 3 and 4 (and occasionally, 5). King's Bounty is a near miss.

I understand that a lot (if not the most) of the games are repeated experience and some of them are really good (say, Diablo 2), but in case of ""King's Bounty: The Legend"" this repeted experience wasn't fun for me.

More exploration and plot-heavy than HoMM, but not much else is original about it. Completely average and muddled with uneven difficulty.

												One of my favourite games that I played last year, great humour, story and world design in a perfect mix between ""RPG"" and ""Heroes of Might&Magic"".It has real time map traversing with round based combat and offers enjoyable degrees of difficulty. It never got boring in the about 70 hours it took me to finish and I always wanted to know how the story will go on and where I'm going to end up next. Unfortunately ""Armored Princess"" wasn't up to the same standards, while still fun it lacks several of the elements that made ""The Legend"" so great.			",451,219,19,70,42,5,75

												Great game! Reminds me of the Heroes of Might and Magic III, just before they ruined the saga.Game is insanely long, easily 80 hours and some fights might get a bit frustrating as the difficulty increases and the slightest mistake can make your live miserable at the beginning.

												I was a huge Heroes of Might and Magic fan when I was younger. As the series progressed, I felt further and further away from it. King's Bounty (A revisioning of a Sega Genesis Game) has brought many hours of screaming, frustration, yells for joy, and victory dances. It's a great strategy game that is worth it's price, even if it's not on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Stunning visuals, deep gameplay, funny conversations and awesome soundtracks. Seriously, this game has some of the best soundtracks ever featured in games.Once you get the hang of it, this game can be quite addictive. King's Bounty: The Legend is a masterpiece. I'm so glad i could buy it again on Steam. Highly recommended by me :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hmm, let's see.I bought this game in a fit of nostalgia over the old King's Bounty for Sega Genesis.I became addicted almost immediately. The wealth of quests and characters, the option to take a wife for extra equipment slots, earning the loyalty of and leveling up your chest of rage summons, the many different creatures you can employ (as well as the initial scarcity of these, forcing you to adapt and change up strategies), and the interesting and engaging boss fights and castle seiges are just a few of the things that kept me at the controls for hours at a time.I loved it. I spent an extra twenty hours at end game completing side quests and defeating enemies because I didn't want to complete the game. I would play it all over again. Fortunately there are sequels with equally good reviews, so I won't have to put myself through that.			",33,12,0,12,3,0,3

												I purchased this game on the premise that it was a clone of the Heroes of Might and Magic series. A clone is a bad description. Turn based-yes and battle mechanics-yes. Detailed storyline-No. Leaders directly influencing the battle to the degree they do in HOMM?-No. With that said, King's Bounty: The Legend, gives the player a good gaming experience for the buck. If you are looking to control character creation and upgrades as you do in HOMM, you may want to head in a different direction. Additionally, quirky camera angles and very generic missions make for a game experience that never reaches the feeling of the HOMM series. Simplistic yet rich graphics for a game that came out in 2008. If tactical strategy is your cup of tea then King's Bounty: The Legend is for you.			",27,18,0,10,3,0,14

												This game is awesome. It was one of the few games in the last years that could really suck me into a world again, this time full of adventure, quests, tactical decisions and more. Combine it with nice graphs, a good story, nice dialogs and good music and before you know it you want to squeeze ever minute out of the gameplay. In my opinion it combines so many good things together. A free roaming open world, tactical battles, storyline, different races/environments, the summonable creatures (kinda like Final Fantasy) and army management.Story: 9/10Gameplay: 9/10Music: 9/10Testing different tactics, strategies, units: 9/10The sequels are fun, but not as captivating and magicall as this one was			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game seems extremely underrated. The game itself is beautiful, the soundtrack is great, and the combat is very intricate. My only complaint is that the grammar/spelling leaves a bit to be desired in some cases, and that when you're given a quest the directions are often a bit vague. Other than that, however, the game is very fun and I expect to bank quite some time on it.			",16,3,0,8,9,0,3

												Beautifully animated single-player tribute to the HOMM series has most of the same charm but with an actual storyline and free-roaming overworld. Expect to dump a large amount of your time into the game on the first time through as a lot of the spells/traits/items require a bit of experimentation before you find the right mix. My only beef with the game is that restocking your army can be a real chore and some of the unit merchants have a limited supply of units which means you'll spend a lot of time backtracking to refresh your forces.

												Game looks kinda silly maybe, but it's awesome.  Customizable ""team"" and character.  You basically do quests and aqcuire troops and level up your own guy which is just a few trees of skills to boost how you do in combat.  There's equipment to help there too.  Then you get summons which level up and you choose how to boost them as they level.  Quite fun and replayable IMO.  I haven't even got to the expansions yet!			",111,19,3,35,21,3,53
