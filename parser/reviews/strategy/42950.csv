												Definitely not an absurdly difficult game, but one that does require planning and strategy. I enjoyed my romp through the a panzer general-esque fantasy world.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is much too hard. I'd like to see someone pass a level without cheating. I'll bet it's impossible. Not sure why they made this game for Koreans only.			",65,5,1,19,2,0,16

												DLC to a game I dislike. But on the other hand, it is a good deal when you buy it in package. And on Sale. Still not my cup of coffee.			",557,147,15,58,38,5,106

												More of Elven Legacy, easier with the help of a broken hero at your disposal and nicely developed maps for your pleasure. If you enjoyed the main and want more here it is.			",147,45,0,96,4,0,24

												This game is out before the age of DLC so it's just an added story to the original elven legacy game. Over all it inherted all the goods and bad of main base game with a much easier story/gameplay.The simplest reason is your main character is way too over powered and even on hardest difficulty only first couple of mission pose as any challange at all. 14 quite straight forward level that gamer can proceed though without much save/load at all.6.5/10 as this DLC add on is a bit too easy and too uneventful.

												Nice addition to a very good, turn-based strategy game in the spirit of the good old Panzer General series. Not a game for anyone but excellent to those to want challenging battles and strategical planning of controlling many different units with vastly different abilities having to fullfil specific goals under limitations (number of turns). Factors from cover, ground type, unit type/abilities affect the outcome of the battles between unit pairs. Leveling heroes and units by adding skills and using artifacts add a light RPG element to the game. With respect to difficulty it is quite easier than the original Elven Legacy, getting all missions with gold rating is not super difficult. I have to disagree with some reviewers, once you understand the strategic rules of the game it is not too difficult.Drawbacks: rather mediocre graphics and definitely not tailored to a casual player.
