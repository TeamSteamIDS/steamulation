												This game is what you could call the ""definitive"" version of Disciples 3. It takes a lot from the first two iteration of D3 and revamps it to make something that is actually enjoyable to play.The biggest problem with original D3 is that it tried to be as close as possible to Disciples 2 in some parts and something completely different (mostly a HoMM clone) in others. The result was an inconsistent, bipolar mess that was neither a proper successor to D2 nor a good rival to Heroes franchise. Not to mention buggy.D3:Reincarnation tries to reconcile the two dysfunctional aspects of the earlier D3 games, and, in my opinion, succeeds in doing so.For those who never played Disciples 3 before: this is turn-based strategy game in the vein of Heroes of Might and Magic. You start with a capital city and a hero, and your job is to recruit an army, explore the map, gather resources, capture new cities, level up yourself and your army, and eventually defeat whatever is the boss of that map particular map.What sets this game apart from HoMM, Eador and similar games is the fact that your ""army"" consist of only a few characters (the actual number is determined by your hero's leadership skill, but caps at six), each of whom gains experience and levels up independently. For that reason it feels more like leading a party of characters in an RPG, than leading an army in a strategy game.This impression is enforced even further by the inventory/equipment system for heroes.Characters don't die permanently unless your entire army gets wiped and can be revived by potions, spells or by paying money in a controlled towns. After gaining three levels, a character ""upgrades"" to a more powerful class, granted you built the appropriate building in your capital. Some characters have mutually exclusive upgrade paths, allowing you to customize your army composition to better suit your play style.When playing single player campaign, your hero retains the levels and equipment from the previous map, but the army starts from square one. This version of D3 includes 4 playable factions and a campaign for each of them. Campaign themselves were redesigned from the earlier versions and now include water traveling. Character stats were also changed substantially to better fit the new hex-based combat (earlier versions just took the stats system from D2 and tried to make it work in a completely new combat system, with not so stellar results).Overall, this version of D3 takes all that was good in previous versions and reworks the rest. If you have an interest in this genre, and weren't irreversibly scarred by earlier D3 versions, you should find this to be a very enjoyable game. It may not be Disciples 2, but I can wholeheartedly recommend it.			",195,104,3,58,42,1,79

												There is a lot of good things in Reincarnation, but the AI and map progression issues have not been resolved from the previous versions.In general:The Good:-Fun races, lots of units, nice strategic approach.-Nice Music.-Graphically appealing, while not being demanding. Well Optimized. (Not last gen tough).-Good Campaign Storyline.-Almost no bugs or glitches (so far).-Leveling system is addictive and dynamic. Can have different builds.The Bad:-Horrible AI. Seriosuly. -Strategic approach is fine, execution is terrible. Weird and unfair issues with CPU enemies.-Extremely slow paced gameplay.-Difficulty is based 100% in the raw power of the enemy armies and it scales poorly as the game goes on.-Once behind it's almost impossible to recover.----------------------------------------------------------------------Now, explaining with more detail:1.- Disciples is a franchise that relies heavily into the management of the encounters you have. The main strategy of the matches rely heavily in how you develop your troops WITHOUT DYING, mainly because the game punishes you hard if you loose a leveled squad. In the past, this kind of difficulty was appealing, but by today standards, it's just not well implemented.The game is more about choosing the right targets to level up and not about the strategic combat. This means that the difficulty is developed by the way you approach the leveling and not about the challenge of battling or developing the resources.2.- The AI is just broken. During the map phase, all the enemy armies just clean the mobs and level up in a certain rate, making few mistakes, while you need to see your way trough the random neutral troops that can range from easy to impossible. While the idea of having a linear leveling experience is boring, making you roam the map searching for the right mobs seems hardly an improvement. This is worsened by the fact that you can't afford to loose a single troop from the squad, so you will be repeating certain battles just for the sake of keeping the squad alive and not loose time in healing (wich, too, can be punishing in certain situations). And you can add to this the fact that while you loose time choosing targets, the AI already knew the right path so now it's 3 levels abobe you and still power-clearing camps.In combat is worse. Melees will approach to engage, ranged will target the nearest high priority target (weakest).No much variation there. All the difficulty relies in you having to clear the lesser troops because usually the neutral enemies will have an outstanding threat that you need to carefully engage if you don't want to get one-shotted. And that is all. It's an easy clean or a fight you will have to repeat until the mobs behave the way you needed or until certain platforms that give you power spawn in better positions for you (wich ends up being the only strategy that the field of battle provides and that is completely random. The AI will rarely use them well).-While fun and useful when you level and clear the map, spells are rather secondary. They can be extremely necesary in certain maps that have incredible neutral camps difficulties; and be just a fun thing to do in other scenarios.Don't get me wrong with this review. Reincarnation is still a good game. It pretty much is a revamp of disciples 2 with a new combat system that is not really that cool. But i can hardly recommend it with all the issues it haves. Gaming has gone a long way from the games that had broken gameplay and weird AI issues. D3 should have been the improvement in those departments and not just the downfall because they not only couldn't fix them but maked them worse.There were other minor issues, but i settled with the most important in my opinion. To do this review i waited to play enough time, but now I felt like I was ready to give an honest, objective opinion about the game. Cheers! ",55,7,1,25,5,0,3

												Disciples 3 was a misguided affair. Buggy, unbalanced trying too much to copy from Heroes of Might and Magic it strayed far for Disciples 2. Reincarnation is an attempt to redo the game. Most bugs were squashed, balancing was redone, battlefields were made much smaller (so it is closer to D2 choice of who to attack instead of running around the field). If you haven't played D2, do so, it is still a much better game. But if you played D2 to death, this version of D3 is actually quite decent. Unfortunately the developer went bankrupt before they finished a planned Mountain Clans DLC so this faction is missing.			",357,123,10,137,57,5,206

												Finally! It comes to Steam Store...Reincarnation is the real Disciples 3. It's Renaissance+Resurrection, with refined tactical system and magic. Its combat is more like an advanced version from Disciples 2. The Combat area is smaller now, and every unit has their own limited movement and attack range, which makes formation extremely important. Ships and thief abilities are back, too! How could a old Disciples Fans miss all these features!!??Although there are still a few balance issues (poor Alliance QAQ...), and a little bugs as well (we have some non-official fix. don't know whether the steam version has fixed them or not), the game has the whole mechanic remastered and fixed all the buggy and annoying problems from the old 2.Moreover, Reincarnation is very mod-friendly. It provides map editor and file-export function. Players could make mod themselves in a very convenient way. Don't miss it! (Really hope it could provide Workshop supportAlthough, not sure if I may see the Clan back agian in this series.... I really don't want to see them just stand in the wild to give you experience like the green skins do....... Anyway, let's hope the Reincarnation may be the reincarnation for the series... and ""reincarnation"" enough to bring us the Clan back in the future...			",163,29,2,31,17,0,21

												Someone needs to give the team/person who worked on this version of Disciples 3 and give him the money he needs to finish the game properly. Dwarfs are missing, I know the history on how the developer went bankrupt and all, but here is an example of a team/person who knows how to develop this series. Sad that good franchises end this way. I hope someone will continue this one. Reincarnation is great, but could be much better if this would have been the first one out instead of the prior ones before this.If you are new to the Disciples series get this one and not the others and you will enjoy it, well worth the current price. If you are a long time fan well it is not Disciples 2 but, as I you may come to like this version of Disciples 3. Worth the price to try and see.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Although this says on the store page it was released on 14 Feb 2014 it has actually been on steam for a long time, it's just that there was no store page for it. It was sold on other online stores with a steam key.The developers of this game are no more so there will likely be no kind of support. There have been problems running it in the past, see the old steam thread hub:http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=251Having said that, it is a good game and I prefer it to Might and Magic: Heroes VI.Wait for a 75% off sale though- it's a year and 9 months or so old and has been 75% off a fair few times before now.

												Imagine if Disciples 3 never existed and instead Disciples II was actually remade into a next gen game. While the base D3 was somewhat iffy, Reincarnation is an awesome game all around. This was achieved by retooling and improving almost every single aspect of the original game.Pros:+ four vastly different factions with their own strengths and weakness+ multiple upgrade paths for units allowing for flexibility+ very long (we're talking 40+ hours each) campaigns+ the gorgeous art style, graphics and awesome musicCons:- some rough edges like one or two mismatched voices			",142,13,1,23,8,0,23

												Disappointing again. It's no wonder this studio has crashed and burned.As a longtime fan of the Disciples franchise who has been with the games since first release, I was excited for months after hearing about Renaissance. Like a lot of folks, I was legitimately upset by the poor quality of the finished game: Other than the beautiful graphics, nothing was right. The feel of the old games was gone along with the Mountain Clans and Undead Hordes factions, and gameplay was plagued by bugs and design flaws. I bought Resurrection in the hope that it might include patches and balancing to fix the vanilla game, and was let down again.When I saw Reincarnation in the Steam store, I managed to get excited yet again, and bought it on impulse.If you like Disciples, don't make that mistake.Gameplay is smoother and the game runs a little better, yes, but the combat alone is ten times as frustrating. I can't count how many times I've loaded a save because just one or two low-level enemy units can chew through your entire force, in campaign mode. Also changed for the worse is the character advancement system, where previously units would upgrade into new, more powerful forms so long as you had the proper structure built in your capital; now, units must level up 3 times before transforming. Good luck surviving that long, and that's from a veteran player and a pretty decent TBS tactician.Overall, even with improvements, Reincarnation is almost too exhaustingly irritating to play, especially in the long sessions for which you might normally enjoy a TBS.4/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I wanted very, very badly to like Disciples 3.  The art is as stunning as Disciples 2, perhaps even more so.  However, the balance is all off - XP gain is not proportional to threats, combat is a slow and frustrating affair (unless you're losing, at which point it will end in two rounds), and even after battles that I've won I had to make a trip back to my capital every single time to resurrect people.  And then, if I'm unlucky, sit and mash ""END TURN"" until I have the money to afford them.The fact that I can only claim land in specific points also adds to the tedium, as I have to watch my territory ponderously expand toward resource cites that I've cleared out for dozens of turns before they are claimed.Of course, the quest dialogue and voice-overs are terrible.  Fortunately there's an easy way to turn unit voices off.There were plenty of improvements between Disciples 2 and Disciples 3, by the way.  Combat is now on a tactical grid a la Heroes of Might & Magic.  Each grid has randomly-determined sites that can increase the effectiveness of one unit type, and leveraging these effectively can make a moderate battle into an easy one (although they still don't make difficult battles into reasonable threats).  Some overworld spells can be cast into runes, which can then be used to cast a scaled-down version of the spell during a battle.  Heroes have something not unlike a very toned-down version of the Sphere Grid from Final Fantasy X, or the leveling system in Final Fantasy 12 - basically a grid in which each square has some sort of bonus, and you can claim any square adjacent to an already-claimed square when leveling up.But ultimately I'd give this one a skip, even as a fan of the genre.

												This is how Disciples 3 should have been like from the start. Reincarnation is an awesome successor of series. Compared to Reinessance maps are reworked, everything(literally!) is rebalanced and difficulty is just set perfect. Contains 3 base campaigns as well as Resurrection one. Even old rock(melee), paper(mage), scissors(archers) system is nicely remade. I think it's combat is the best I have seen(archers or mages aren't OP) and I played a lot of heroes-like games. Also except some minor translation bugs everything is fine. Buy this instead trying Heroes 6 or 7 uplay disasters.			",98,35,5,50,16,1,15

												They took everything what's good in disciples 3 and entirely rebalanced it to make good disciples chapter and good game in general, they significantly improved writing and level design and they gave it for free for owners of both previous disciples 3 games.Global strategy aspect is still lost, but now each individual battle is better than in disciples 2, so in the end it's on par with disciples 2. There are still couple of weird scripts and bugs here, but in general game runs totally fine and smooth, also works with nvidia surround. The most notable bug is what they changed in undead campaign final boss, check guides to possible workaround for that.

												I'm mixed about this game.I've been polaying it for quite a while, but somehow I can't seem to either love it nor hate it.First of, I love this style of game. You control a hero and a small party, and you walk on a fogged map discovering locations, enemies and quests. I've had a lot of fun with a similar one (Expeditions: Conquistador) and so I thought I'd try this one out.You start with a kind of cliche history about demons, the end of the world and all that. Since I'm not a native english speaker, I felt like they could've added sulbtitles so I wouldn't get so lost and disconnected about the history. After the intro, you get a nice tutorial, which explains pretty much all the basics of the game (altough the different factions and units are not explained at all, so each one you play with you'll have to see it for yourself what suits you better by trial and error). After that, you're all set to play the campaign.First of, I think the narrator did a very nice job. All of them read pretty nicely the texts that open each act from each faction. Problem is, that's al lthe voice acting you get. The rest is just at the beggining or after battles and it's the same sound over and over again. The history is presented to you at the beggining of the acts and while playing them, by non spoken dialogue.For me the game started fun (on hard mode), I would walk and take my time to kill every monster and discover every part of the map (which is what the developers wanted, I guess). But some monsters are impossible to beat on any given map on the early stages of the game, even with a full party with max lvl soldiers.The graphics are neither top notch nor bad, they fit decently into the game's theme. Only visual problem I had was with some long dialogues being cut by the ""continue"" buttom you must press after each characther has spoken. So you kind of miss some information. Couldn't the devs have made a scroll bar or just have the person say something in two dialogues instead of one?Anyways, the fun I've had in the previous 30 hours gave place to a feeling of boredom. I mean, after all you just go from map to map doing the same thing over and over, there are two or three secondary quests tops and the only thing keeping you forward is a little piece of history given to you before each act. And there are a lot of acts from all the factions. So you play each act for about 5 hours or more (if you kill every guy like me) and then there is 5 more lines of history and then 5 more hours doing the same thing. It gets boring pretty fast, especially if you don't like this kind of game.What keeps it better is that you can kind of ""auto-resolve"" a battle to make the game run faster, but the AI is so stupid that even aganist the weakest enemies you can lose one or two soldiers because the AI chooses to advance with only one guy aganist 7, even though you have 5 guys to attack (Idk why its so stupid since the AI of the enemy computer, altough not very bright, isn't that stupid).My veredict is that, if you like this kind of strategy games, give this one a try, especially if on sale. I'll be fun for quite a while. But be warned that you'll be bored before knowing how the history ends. If you're going to go all the way to the end is up to you. I, myself, don't know if I will.

												The Disciples series is one of the most beautiful underrated franchise in gaming strategy. It is the same genre as the classic Heroes of Might and Magic, and it has become a sort of ""cult classic""ever since the massive success of Disciples II.This third entry follows that tradition, by keeping a beautiful, dark, artwork, combined with unforgiving mechanics and an enticing world/factions. However, Disciples 3 was a complete wreck at launch, laden with game breaking bugs and suffering with inferior mechanics to it's predecessor.The ""Reincarnation"" version of the game, the one I'm reviewing, is definitely a more polished version of Disciples 3 ""Gold"" (the vanilla + ressurection expansion). This, sadly, does not mean the game was completely overhauled in it's faults, but simply that all of it's game breaking bugs were fixed and some balancing issues were addressed.Overrall, Disciples 3: Reincarnation is a good game which follows a strong tradition laid by the classic Disciples II. However, it is still, at it's best, an unpolished gem, very rough in the edges. That means people with low tolerance to lack of polish will not enjoy this game, and people new to the series fare better to begin their immersion in the Disciples world with the predecessors games. However, if you are a fan of the HOMM-like strategy genre, you will definitely like this game, which is by itself worth your money in any sale, as unpolished as it may be.			",101,35,1,15,12,2,20

												I was a fan of Disciples 1 and 2 but all the Disciples 3 games seems to me inferior and not fun at all. The comparison to Heroes of Might & Magic is very misleading because, in Disciples, the level up of your units is so long that you have to keep the same 4-6 units for a whole map and grind slowly with many small battles without an ounce of tactics.The art is not as good as in Disciples 2. And the highest graphics settings don't do any good because of a  very mediocre engine.Conclusion : Highly disappointed. I can't see any redeeming quality for this game.			",729,226,36,111,97,7,203

When I saw that they went back and made the Reincarnation version I thought that I would try it... I must say that I truly enjoy this version (despite the awkward map scrolling and camera rotation)... In Reincarnation are many of the things that I felt could have improved Disciples 2 and I am happy that the spirit of Reincarnation carries the franchise forward in such a beautifully crafted manner... The sheer beauty of this game coupled with challenging gameplay should please any true fan of turnbased strategy RPGs and I am hopeful that someone will work to make this version modable in the near future... I will admirably give this game an 8 out of 10 score...			",21,9,0,32,2,0,10

												Highly recommend this game. For those who disappointed with Renaissance and Ressurection, this game is nothing like those 2.  The developers made very good revisions and improvements before they go down, and it really worth it. The biggest issue is game balance, and it can be easily adjust through modding as the game is very customizable, and you dont need to be a computer geek to learn to mod. There are plenty of mods in the forum that fix game errors, bugs, and imbalance, and bring in new elements to game play. The only real downside of the series is the discontinuation of the Mountain Clan. I hope that the game will generate enough sales so that it can be continued, and our favorite Mountain Clan can see the light of day.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Akella sure knows how to confuse people with their Disciples 3 series. You got Renaissance, Resurrection and now Reincarnation. Well for me all goes as i can't get enough of this series, with game killing bugs and ridicilous difficulty spikes and all.  Hard not to recommend (with caveats) this series to veterans of Disciples 2 as this one is now the one that Disciples 3 was supposed to look like. Renaissance was not bad even though it had game killing bugs and certain 'press button to win' -tactics that is just an abomination when talking about wicked hard games like earlier Disciples games. Resurrection was a disaster. Don't even think about playing that one as it had game bugs that include graphics card glitches, unrealistic level up requirements and difficulty that went trough the roof once more.  Reincarnation on other hand is the most recent one and it contains all the campaigns you need. Disciples 2 remastered would be the best thing ever but until that happens this game will have to do. At least one does not get PTSD playing Reincarnation. Sometimes....do i dare to say it... the mood is quite 'casual' and you can just enjoy the terrible fates of the main characters.

												I will start with the improvements. 1. More NPC bands and treasure on the map making it easier to level up and makes the terrain map a closer feel to D2. 2. BoatsNow the fails between Older versions of D3 and this pile of poo.1. The character info screen. Tab #2 to see my XP? It's the stat I look at most often. Wait... WTF! Tabs!?!?!?! The right click character info from the older D3 editions were closer to D2 (and better).2. The 3 tier levelling process of your support units. Again these guys made changes where older D3 editions got it right. I don't want to dump that much combat experience into a disposable unit before he upgrades. ""Look! I only need to play 643 more hours before my squire levels to paladin""... Go die. This also makes it harder to have multiple well supported leaders, so Lambert has the paladin while your other leaders rock squires and knights. Side note: Your characters that die in combat also gain experience... This felt strangely like cheating.3. The smaller battle map. Either copy Heros of Might and Magic, or stick with static formation turn based combat like D2 and old classics like Final Fantasy and Chrono Trigger. The smaller map makes it near pointless to move around and puts your ranged units and magic users in harms way like never before. ""Oh, Look! You got creative in an uninspired game"". Your creative efforts have gained you a hybrid, akin to the crap you take that comes out like you've been eating cheese for a month, but leaves your butt dirty like Taco Bell diarrhea.4. The ranged/magic user unit's attack range has been limited (which was never a thing in any previous installment). Ranged units were weaker, but could hit anything on screen, so you never had to move them into melee combat, or off bonus tiles (in D3). This further weakens an already weak support unit. I assume this was meant to draw ranged units off the bonus tiles by having your melee units ""Run Away!"". Pro Tip: concentrate attack on bonus ranged/magic unit. They will not have that bonus after 1 => 2 rounds of combat. Limiting range of ranged units = EPIC FAIL!!!!			",34,15,0,18,14,0,20

												Ok, I need to write a review about this game. Are you a Disciples fan? Have you found yourself lost in the previous versions for hours on end? Then buy this game. Its better than all the other new ""R"" incarnations I can't spell (Renaisance, Resurecction, whatev) since it takes the best from all of them and leaves the rest out. I read some of the negative reviews on here and like a fool I let it delay me from having the best Disciples experience since Sacred Lands Gold. This is polished, flowing, and builds on the previous games while adding modern mechanics and TONS of new artwork. People giving negative reviews can be listened to but their complaints are mostly about Disciples in general. Is it hard? Not nearly as hard as the first Disciples was. Is it tedious? Not nearly as much as Disciples 2 was. The magic is very specific, as in certain spells may sound all-powerful (and be bloody expensive) but there are many times they will be useless in battle. You have to be careful and cherish everything you find. There's lots... LOTS to explore and discover. It will take you a long time to develop powerful characters that can face anything (as in, multiple levels and countless hours), but yeah that's Disciples for you. The game is all about power-matching and countering, like any good magic fantasy, but Disciples was always famous for ramping things up and this version is no different. You will be forever out-matched, that's the point! Courage and charge on! Also, get good at healing and using powerups. Again, if you liked the original Sacred Lands with all its glitchy headaches and miserable gameplay (ie. always being outgunned), then you will like this game. Also, you can now carry forward two heroes with 9 items each to new campaign levels (!!!)  Oh and when you resurrect a unit, they retain their experience from the previous battles and will level up upon returning to life if they can! Yay improvements! The art is fantasic, worth it just for that imo, and also if you're obsessive compulsive like me and love a good, complex, interesting and ultimately satisfying game (your souls are MINE you damn dirty elves!)Hints if you've never played before or its been a while;- When upgrading your leader skills, you should ALWAYS been gunning for the extra leadership point. Adding another member to your team is the best possible thing you can do.- Set difficulty to easy and leave it there.- Legion was always unfairly powerful, its the same this time, so play as them I guess if you're having trouble. Invest in Fiends and have them do the dirty work.- Pretty everything you do should be geared toward upgrading two good, balanced teams. When a member dies you gotta go back and resurrect/heal, yes every time. Pump all experience into the same 8-10 units. Spend all extra cash on leveling up dudes in training camps.- The easy enemies in the beginning are very valuable. Save them as easy pickings for your newest recruits.- Turn the music off or you're going to drive yourself insane! (My last level was 140 turns!!)			",149,56,0,7,6,0,22

												Both games Renaissance and Ressurection are combined here, plus a few extra maps for good value.  Sadly, however, the combat system has been ""tweaked"" yet again, and is fiddly and time consuming.  Originally it was the simnplicity of the combat system that gave this game its appeal.  They honestly did not need to change it.  Former fans of Heroes of Might And Magic, who had abandoned that game as it became so childish, flocked to this in preference.  Still a game I would recommend, but I'd actually suggest buying the two stand-alone games mentioned above, instead of the combined package here.  A classic example of how sometimes change is not for the better.			",28,7,0,16,22,1,13

Interim review:Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥I love this game. They fixed the vast majority of things I disliked in Renaissance.If you are interested in the difference between the versions, see here.Also changed:+ Tremenduous improvements in the user-friendliness of the UI.+ They added some amazing background songs.+ More polished and sharper visuals, more foliage, better 'time of the day' implementation.+ Hotkeys! (And overall more settings.)It feels like they really listened to player feedback, and remade the game to a quality it should have been made the first place. Finally a game I really enjoy playing, and feel is a worthy successor to Disciples 2!			",53,357,2,100,57,1,89

												A much better and totally improved version of Disciples 3.  This is what it should have been from the beginning.  It's a shame that the company shut down before this actually became the primary version of the game.  They got a new voice actor to read the scenario information, which is a HUGE improvement.  They shrank the battlefields which was a great improvement for combat.  They revamped and rebalanced each unit and hero in the game and they rebalanced all of the scenarios in the game.  This results in a much more enjoyable experience.  Sadly, it may have come too late for the future survival of this series.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Recommend not playing this game on hard. The game isn't good enough to warrant the extra challenge it entails. If you're playing because you liked Disciples 2, then you're probably playing for the story (which admittedly isn't very good either). Took me about 120 hours to finish the first campaign. That's with less than 50 turns used per mission, minimal potions and spells, and full clear every map. Pretty brainless for me overall aside from occasional battle rigging, watched One Piece while playing this.Gameplay:Concept changes all around for the most part but the core difficulty remains approximately the same. A lot of battles need to be rigged to be won or return when higher leveled. Tactics and proper magic usage will for the most part win most battles. If we're comparing difficulty between this game and Disciples 2 (hard difficulty), they are approximately the same but functioning off different systems. You still had to rig battles in Disciples 2 until your hero was OP and magic was also pretty important as well. The critical strike system is pretty bad though. Some new features like the ""guardians"" are pretty terrible, rodbearers were exponentially better. Overall, might be worth buying on sale if you were a fan of Disciples 2 otherwise stick with HoMM series. Game wasn't bad, but it's not worth recommending to the average player.			",31,7,0,12,1,0,6

												I don't often write reviews, but many of the amateur articles I've read about the Reincarnation edition of Disciples III have been deplorable and unfair. I am 35 and a lifelong PC gamer. I love strat games. Chess is my #1 game in general and there are few other strategy games I appreciate.If you know and remember Master of Monsters (Sega Genesis), I say this edition of D3:R is worth your cashola. There are no bugs I've seen (Win 7, nice compy, blah blah). In fact, it's one of the more solid games I've played. I like that I can Alt-Tab out and do other things; the sound stops, the game stays static and contained, totally dependable. I have often kept my Disciples campaign running for days, just clicking into the window to make a few moves and then going about my business, not unlike how I play chess.There are threads and threads of bad press about this game in its past forms. I tell you, this game is gold -- extremely reasonably priced -- and a great work of art the series of which has culminated in something I am absolutely enjoying. Feel comfortable sending me a question if you like. I'd be happy to defend this software in my private time.			",163,82,2,17,16,0,30

												Having played Disciples II and all 3 versions of Disciples III, I have mixed feelings about Reincarnation. I prefer the larger arena's of Disciples Renaissance over the smaller Arena's in Reincarnation. The one advantage of small arenas is the battle seems more personal. The downside is in larger arenas you could have a couple small battles within the arena, and obstacles would have a greater impact. The dev's claim that Reincarnation's maps are more open.  I don't agree, the maps seem even more cluttered. The only difference is you may have a shortcut path to cut across between 2 longer paths. The paths are still extremely linear. The seas ended up just being rivers and are as linear as you can get.Reincarnation does have more settings that help to tailor the game to a player's preferences. An example is a setting to adjust attack animations within the arena. They have added some skills to the thief or fixed skills that didn't work correctly in previous versions. Certain arena skills are now triggered by critical hits or other events. This maybe helps the ai slightly but does not add any new strategy to combat.The lighting and shadows are improved but then they decided to have the shadows rotate 90 degrees every 1/4 day. This begins to get annoying after 50 turns. I wish they would have had a feature to turn this off.  Another design decision I don't like is that you can't zoom out as far on the worldmap as you could in Renaissance. To me,  this makes the game feel less epic in scale. It also hints to the fact that this version really has no world map strategy to consider.  You can only see about 7 move points out from your hero in any given direction.If this had been my first version of D3, the graphics would have really impressed me. However, since I had already played 2 versions of the game, it was no surprise.  Personally I don't think it any better than Renaissance. It has a different flavor, some new units. I feel Renaissance never got a fair shake because it was released essentially in beta state. Renaissance patched to 1.02 is as good in its own right as Reincarnation.  I don't like that the dev's made 3 separate versions of the same game. It is because there are things I like better from each version, so when I play either one, I always miss something from the other version. Reincarnation is not quite as moddable as previous versions as system files can not be modded.Pros - New units include 5 new orc types, wild boar, and a few sea creatures.        - Stellar Graphics that aid in creating a totally immersive environment.        - Same campaign is slightly rewritten and takes place on new maps.Cons - Tutorial is close to useless         - Still very linear maps even if they have a couple more shortcut paths         - You can usually take as many turns as you need  before attacking difficult enemies.

												Love this game! I held of on buying Disciples 3 due to hearing terible things about Renaissance. But after reading how Reincarnation fixes many of the issues i bought it in a heart beat on gamersgate 6 months ago. The music and atmosphere is great and really makes the franchise stand out compared to other turnbased strategy games.Though the combat is more HOMM like instead of Disicples 1 and 2, its still a very fun game. I really recommend this game to people who love turn based games, especially to Disiciples fans.			",53,10,0,12,4,0,8

												This is a very polished and balanced version of the original disciples 3 games.It feels worked, solid and different in every little corner. Map has more stuff now, variety of enemies has been increased and i have the feeling that difficulty is raised a little (in a pleasant way), making map spells essential. If you enjoyed the originals like me, i think you'll find this one pleasantly refreshing. If you didn't like the originals, i think you're going to enjoy this one as it is very professionaly polished. The game remains the same and still gets repetitive. But battles and map movement now feels a little more dynamic.Voice acting is now mediocre, from laugable-terrible that it was before:).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Reincarnation, indeed. It feels like the game was reborn. Visually, it's the same. Internally, it's a new game.It has become more complex, more complicated in terms of combat: party-to-party battles are more diverse, action-filled, and enjoyable now. RPG elements grew a bit stronger, being felt more distinctly than before. But what's the most important, endless bugs that haunted the players of original Disciples III: Renaissance are now fixed. Maps are loaded instantly, parties are never teleported to the city they have last visited, bottomless treasure bags with hundreds of potions inside are gone, a party can now enter the city (and not just stand next to it), game doesn't randomly crash anymore...Playing Disciples III has finally become a pleasure.If you had painful experience with the original game, never hesitate, get this. Troubles are gone in this edition.If you are new to Disciples, then I'm telling you that this is a step-by-step strategy slightly influenced by RPG genre. It tells a story of several races fighting for dominance in the world of Nevendaar. Each of these races has their own goals, but their paths are constantly crossing, resulting in fierce battles. Control the resources the map has to offer, make small parties of soldiers where every fighter has their own unique skills, choose the way they will progress by means of building certain structures in your capital, and fight numerous foes to gain experience and treasures (including new weapons, armor and other stuff for your character and other party leaders). Some people say that it resembles Heroes of Might and Magic; of this, I cannot tell anything, because I never played the latter.So, this day has come: I can now recommend Disciples III. So great to see this wonderful strategy series getting what it truly deserves.			",77,8,2,22,8,0,5

												It is NOT a worthy successor to Disciples 2, like Heroes 5 is not a worthy successor to Heroes 3, it's not even a TBS, but it's no longer a complete fail like the original Disciples 3 is (who said Heroes 4?).Patrick Lambert's talent gave life to the world of Disciples 2, a sane grade of realism in a gothic fantasy world where humans look like humans, orcs are orcs and dragons feel like they're alive. Reincarnation is still gothic, but artist's anime abuse shines through all holes, most of the atmosphere is gone and calling one of the protagonists Lambert seems like a bad joke or outright trolling. Treat this game not like a sequel or a remake, but like a fan-made jRPG spin-off in the same universe and you'll enjoy your journey, just don't expect anything special, it doesn't bring up nostalgia.It's now quite balanced, I've managed to beat the first 3 campaigns on maximum difficulty without much strain and quite enjoyed it. No more spell and resurrect-spamming, no more '4 trolls per enemy party' to keep game challenging and in-combat creature summoning now works 'right' (for those who remember how Zombie talisman was useful in Disciples 2).Story has some twists and turns, 'darkness in not the evil, greed and indifference are' etc. You're already used to saving damsels in distress, right? What can go wrong?			",99,7,0,17,3,0,12

												A very tentative recommendation. Do not play if:- You are heavily discouraged by poor unit balance- The stupid physical immunes from Disciples II were your bane- You expect the enemy AI to actually do anything on the overworld map- You expect experience proportionate to challenge- You expect the highest point in the challenge curve to be late-game rather than right at the beginningThat last point is the real issue. Early-game heroes are weak as day-old kittens - no more being the equivalent of a tier 2 from the start! - and the neutral units seem heavily biased toward a fast hero with high accuracy. Meanwhile, at the end of a campaign you'll stomp through the highest tier enemies like they weren't even there. Which is very cathartic.All of the elements of a good Disciples game are here - the gothic setting, the glorious art, the sudden but inevitable betrayals. I'd say it's worth playing for those times when the balance sits just right.			",30,6,0,6,1,0,3

												Well I tried to give this sorry excuse of a game another try. I purchased it when it first came out and the combat system was terrible. It takes like 10 rounds to beat goblins and imps. The enemy always has the advantage moving onto conveniently place focus points to screw you over and running like a little crap if you even get near killing one of its spell casters to another conveniently place spell power focus area. The computer will score criticals on your units and then immediately get another turn it seems due to ""good initiative."" I am sure the units get much better and each time I try to play this game it just flat out cheats. I will be a level 1 hero in the campaign and it will throw me against rogues and I have no chance of hitting them where they just take turns wasting my units. Your hero is supposed to be the leader of these armies and to me they feel like a bunch of weaklings and it really takes away from the epic feel the game is trying to bestow. I was really hoping this would be a good patch and it started promising, but it failed again. I agree with many of the users that gave a negative review or even a posititve review, JUST PLAY DISCIPLES II IS A MUCH BETTER GAME! I don't understand how pitching six to eight units in a quick style combat is so hard for the Disciples III team to make. Start the battle and just have the units hit one another! No focus points or movement and all that crap! Make the units have significantly less HP and scale the difficulty! D+ only because the graphics and artwork are great.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I think the positive reviews are mostly due to extremely lowered expectations from the previous disciples iii releases. Although improved, still no comparison to the original titles. There are some good points about the game, but in general progression is extremely slow, fights are repetitive and not rewarding (in terms of XP but also artifacts are boring). There is no AI, more or less you fight only against natural groups of monsters.			",14,9,0,12,0,0,10

												Personally I don't like Reincarnation much since they twisted the game so much and a lot of unbalanced stuffs happened, like the Imp, I always thought that Small Imps are ""tier 1"" creatures like they had always been in D2 and the last 2 D3 versions. But not anymore, they are now nightmares for your all tier 1 troop which mostly have around 8 to 12 Accuracy while those Imps have 43 Invasion (you will miss - a lot), and 140 health and 33 damage and 30 Accuracy (they do CRIT a lot, almost all the time) and 28 Initiative... basically, you just can't win against them without using some spells. And some more things I don't like to mention here as it will be too long.			",50,3,0,8,1,0,6

												A completely overhauled Disciples 3. Too bad this game wasn't launched in this final state, it would would've undoubtedly gotten a way better reception than it did. It's estethically drop dead beautiful, the mechanics are mostly sound and it's LONG.The change from a simple Disciples 2 combat to a full-blown 3D HOMAM-style arena is controversial. In the original game the arena was way too big, the fights too long as a result and the whole game felt like a grindfest. Now the arena is significantly smaller and the fights are snappier. But a whiff of grind is still there.An issue that bothered me more was the economy. You simply have way too much money in this game. It's not uncommon to have 30k-40k gold from mid-game which makes levelling up units trivial. You simply buy a rookie unit, go to a Training Camp, sink several grand in and voila, you got yourself an elite. It's like Diablo 3 auction house all over again. Maybe the devs wanted to make up for the fact that units level up quite slow on their own but they should've lower the XP requirements instead.All in all though if you love D2 this version of D3 is probably gona be your cup of tea too. Definitely a very good HOMAM-like game and a very good value too.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you played Disciples and/or Disciples II, and did not like what Disciples III had become (Disciples III: Renaissance and/or Disciples III: Ressurection), give Reincarnation a try! Same goes for fans of HoMM series, this version of Disciples can give you a fresh experience.This is the most recent and best developed version. Reincarnation binds all Disciples III content together (Renaissance + Ressurection), with heavily revamped maps, completely changed gameplay(Back to the old style, more like the first 2 games), and is not as unforgiving as before. (Ironically the first mission of the easiest campaign(Imperials) was the most difficult mission in the game)Maps are now a lot more open, you're no longer limited to a single path, and enemy armies twice as strong as you no longer come for you after just a few turns. If you are used to the challenge Disciples Series has given so far, I do recommend highest difficulty, as the only downside to this version is the challenge has been lowered considerably - But this is also a huge upside, as some missions and places simply were too difficult (I do enjoy a challenge, like old skool games gave, but at some point it's no longer fun to either keep restarting from scratch or act like a save junkie to abuse your way trough a single battle.)I've spend hundreds of hours on Disciples II. Had so much fun with that. Then when Disciples III came, I never thought I'd enjoy a Disciples game again. So much had changed, for the worse. Luckily, I was not the only one who thought this way. The community worked together with the devs to bring out Disciples III: Reincarnation, the way Disciples III should have been in the first place.It's just too bad a lot of fans of the series will never even know about this. I reckon most will easily confuse this with the earlier Disciples III games, unaware the game changed so much in the meantime.			",77,7,3,9,3,0,11

												Full disclosure: I haven't played any previous Disciples games. Also, I am only in the first campaign so far and am playing on easy level since I'm not exactly the most skilled gamer. (However, I'm watching a normal Let's Play and I'm not really seeing a difference in combat stats/abilities so maybe this affects the enemy faction resources and aggressiveness?)Disciples III: Reincarnation is a mix of strategy and RPG with turn-based combat. There are four campaigns each featuring a different faction: Empire (human), Legion (demons), Alliance (elves) and Horde (undead). Each campaign is made up of multiple missions each with its own map. Each campaign also has you playing a main hero, although you can also hire others.When heroes level you get points to spend in a skill grid which can be used to increase their attributes or gain other abilities and perks (e.g. increasing your leadership to allow more units in your party or gaining resistence to a certain element).Regular units also level but you cannot choose their skills; instead, they progress along a skill ""line"". However, at the cost of gold and stone you can build structures in your base that allow units to upgrade to a higher tier which provides increased damage/healing and health and sometimes additional benefits. For example, the Empire's archer can be upgraded to a marksman who shoots fire arrows and then can be upgraded again to an assassin who throws daggers which add a poison debuff. Each unit also has a toggle that prevent upgrades if you want. Using the previous example, you might not want one of your marksman to upgrade because they have longer range and can hit physically immune monsters. Upgrade paths may be mutually exclusive so once you choose a path the others are locked. For example, Empire healers have two path choices: single target high value heals or area of effect lower value heals.Combat takes place on a hex grid which may contain melee, ranged or magical power spots. Placing your character on these spots will increase your damage or healing. Combat is turned based with an initiative system that is not entirely intuitive. If a unit has a very high initiative compared to others, it will not only go first but may act again in the same round.Pros: I enjoy the map exploration. They're quite large and there's a lot of stuff to find so you'll want to make sure you're thorough so you don't miss anything. So far the story seems pretty decent. Not earth-shattering but not terrible. Combat is fun. At first, strategic options are somewhat limited but you can gain additional abilities as you gain levels or find items such as runes, tomes or rings. Positioning plays an important role as you don't want to be on the wrong side of those power spots. Unless it is a scripted fight, you can trigger combat and then retreat if it looks too tough. You can hire additional heroes of different class types although you will always have the main hero.Neutral: Your heroes are persistent throughout the campaign and keep their stats and equipment. However, everything else (potions, runes, trade items) is lost including your army (other than any story-related units). You will start each mission with the main hero. If you hired other heroes in previous missions, you can choose one to get back again right away but the others will need to be re-hired at a cost that increases depending on their level. This ""restart"" may bother some people while others may not care. It can be rough when first starting out since everything seems stronger than your party. You'll need to pick and choose your fights carefully. Stick with it though, you will get stronger! (I put this here since some may not have an issue with this but I have noticed that some reviews specifically mention combat difficulty being kind of frustrating.)Cons: The UI did not seem very intuitive to me. I also found it to be kind of ugly compared to the rest of the graphics. The combat camera can be a little...odd. As units attack it will move and can sometimes end up behind a battlefield obstacle so you can't see anything. Worse yet is when it zooms in behind a giant titan or fat imp in their skimpy loin cloths and becomes dangerously close to simulating a colonoscopy. The battle summary will tell you that x units leveled but not which ones. Before the summary is shown experience numbers will float above the units' heads as well as level up indications but I found that the camera is rarely at an angle that I could actually see this very well. I'm not a big fan of the skill grid. It's a big mass of squares with symbols that have limited tool tips (hovering shows you the name but you have to right-click the square to see what it actually does). When selecting new skills the available ones change colour slightly and pulsate a bit, but with my less-than-stellar eyesight I still find them difficult to see, especially as you get more skills. If you trigger a scripted event, the dialogue is always with the main hero even if you triggered it with a different hero. Any associated combat however, is done with the triggering hero which could be problematic if it was a lone scout. Merchant prices for equipment seem pretty high compared to your income so chances are that when you first find them you won't be able to afford the good stuff. Once you control the map you can continually pass turns to accumulate gold but that's not particularly fun, especially since the merchants are not shown on the mini-map so you have to remember where they were and run all over the map again to get to them. It's difficult to level multiple heroes since there's only so much XP to go around unless you keep waiting for dungeons to respawn. Plus at the beginning of the missions you don't have the gold to re-hire previous heroes or build multiple armies and by the time you do, the map is half cleared and your main hero still needs XP anyway. There are training camps where you can buy levels but then you get into the same situation as you did trying to get gold to buy equipment. While the story is okay, sometimes it doesn't quite mesh with what you do on the map. I'm supposed to be a Knight of the Empire, so why am I killing peasants again? Oh right, because I'm low level, need experience and there are no giant rats around. Got it. There are some typos in some of the dialogues. Pretty sure the narrator went to the Steven Wright School of Voice Acting.Conclusion:I know some Disciples fans were disappointed in this, but I'm having a lot of fun with it. The list of cons seems long but a lot of them are little irritations rather than any real show-stoppers. I've got a lot of hours in and I'm not even past the first campaign yet so I'm definitely getting my money's worth.			",20,8,0,27,8,0,7

												Despite all the drawbacks starting right from the beginning, the Reincarnation is a solid version of the game; I played to the very end and could enjoy it a lot. With more natural enemies, some new magic animation, graphical twitches and other new features in the game, it's only pity that due to bankruptcy the add-on with Mounting Clans was cancelled. Yes, it's not the original D1-2 style kind of game, combat particularly, probably they intended to get more HOMM-mish gameplay but still a very descent game after all. I can definitely recommend it, especially if you like this series.			",84,32,0,6,1,0,3

I like the new interface too. its more intuitive and the info of the units are better explained"". I have to say that, for be playing just a cuple of hours, is much better than Renaissance and Resurrection.The only things that i don't like is the music loop. In a battle never change, its always the same since the beginning (like a repeating track). You have the option for make it random, but its buggy.In the other hand, all the other things are correct (or more, they fixed a lot of bugs and errors).If you like this kind of games, this is your oportunity to get it for an amazing price :)			",203,17,2,26,11,0,20

												At first I was looking forward to some good old Disciples after the years, thinking there will be some innovative touch here and there. What awaited me, though, was one big unbalanced mess. For one, interface and new approach to castles we already know and love were steps in the right direction. Also the new approach to the character upgrades with some minor boosts to troops pleasantly surprised me.On the other hand, the battle-system is maybe the most broken one I've encountered to date. I don't know if I somehow played it wrong (but considering I've read through tutorials and such, I think it wasn't my fault after all), but battles were just lenghty, repetitive chore. In every and each one of them you need to have one hell of luck on your side, because enemies are ""tough"". And the reason for quation marks is simple. I thought maybe I just chose bad enemies for the beginning of a map. Then I realized it's the same story with every enemy unit I attack, not only you have to pray so your troops actually hit something every now and then, but also you have to deal with the illusion of some strategy on that little Heroes rip-off action map. I understand that change is very important part in everything, but for the God's sake don't change that one kind of unique thing, which was perfectly functional, simple yet fun to play with.To summarize it, I wouldn't recommend this to anybody, especially not to the Disciples fans. Good idea killed by totally non-functional battle-system.			",25,16,0,20,11,0,14

												All the problems that you've faced in the previous Disciples 3 editions have been pretty much sorted out. Reincarnation is the master bugfix, and adds a lot of quality of life changes to the game, such as healers in the party taking one last move at end of combat to heal up your troops before you head out, and adding a more streamlined progression system for skills and levels.To those that have never Played a Disciples game, the soundtrack and visual style are gorgeous, and the gameplay is very enticing, with lots of options to play it straightforward, or grind for the perfect team compilation. If you want an awesome turn based strategy, you have found your mark. As a long-time fan of the Disciples series, I can finally endorse Disciples 3 with Reincarnation; it has made up for what its two previous installments lacked.			",106,11,0,40,42,0,41

												This game probably plays very nicely; however, there is literally no support for the game for modern computers. I am trying to run it on a high-end gaming PC (nVidia 970M, 16GB RAM, plenty of hdd and ssd space, lots of processing power, no other  nonessential processes running in the background) and I can barely run this game at medium settings, which are only one step above ""low"". I tried messing with all combinations of video settings, and the game still failed. When I tried googling for documentation to troubleshoot this problem, all I found were a few words about Disciples 2 that stated that one must enable Direct3D in the graphics settings. Sadly, there is no such setting in Disciples 3.As such, the game is essentially unplayable to anyone with a fairly new computer. I'd strongly advise against purchasing the game.			",33,6,0,27,2,0,4

												I love the Disciples series but initially avoided the multiple iterations Disciples 3 due to all of the negative reviews and confusion. Even after researching this particular iteration of Disciples 3, ""Reincarnation"", I was skeptical but decided to buy it anyway -- and I am glad I did! This is the best version of Disciples I have ever played, an elegant blend of original Disciples dark themes, stylistic artwork and dramatic music with the more tactical ""Heroes of Might and Magic"" or King's Bounty"" series. If you liked either of those series or previous Disciples games you should check this one out, it is the best of all worlds.			",29,15,0,45,3,1,37

												I tried to play this game on few occasions, and it always makes me regret it. It's a barely playable mess. Reincarnation is a transformation of original Disciples 3, that tries so hard to be like Disciples 2, that it makes you wonder: why play this, when you have an excellent Disciples 2? Akella made the same game THRICE, and while Disciples 2 is an improvement to 1, Reincarnation is not even close to being equally good as either of the previous entries. They changed this game into a bad version of Disciples 2, worse in almost every aspects (if not literally every). I can stand the unintuitive UI and sluggish controls, but I can't - for the love of all that is holy - bear the combat and that is my main issue with this game.First, we have a leader that is completely useless. I don't even know if he will become a force to be reckoned with later on, he is useless at the beginning and dies from one or two hits, while dealing 1/3 as much damage as normal units. Then we have the overall balance of combat; it's INCREDIBLY hard. I don't understand how am I supposed to defeat even one group of enemies that have some overpowered units with hundreads of health and AoE attacks that two-shots my mages and heroes. It's not like they are not standing right in front of my base, guarding basic resources...Is this a game about exploration and looking for that one, specific group of enemies that will allow me to level up? Or is this a game about taking that one-and-only useful hero and a very specific combination of units? Neither of these appeal to me, and neither of these was mandatory in Disciples 2.Hotseats (that can be played with AI) feels just unplayable. Campaign is barely more bearable, but equally not fun with the clunky, slow and random combat. I felt like they lowered hit chance to around the same, idiotic values as in Disciples 1 or even lower and one, just ONE miss can completely ruin whole encounter.Mind you, I don't take into account the artstyle and music. It's good, art is even great, but a hit or miss sometimes. It can be gorgeous at times and it can be ugly on another asset or picture, but the overall design is what you would expect from the series: unique and very atmospheric.			",46,11,0,7,0,0,17

												With beautiful visuals, amazing soundtrack, and the Disciples name in the title what could possibly go wrong? Well the most important part of the game, the combat, kills the game. It's clunky, difficult to control your troops, you cant pick which direction to attack the enemy from (flanking and such), and the camera acts weird. I've only played like 2 hours and already I'm losing interest. If only they would have designed the battle part of this game better...I'd be hooked.			",42,10,0,24,2,0,14

												When Disciples 3 first came out it was a total mess. I uninstalled it within hours. With the suggestion of a friend I tried Reincarnation and it was suprisingly good. It still is a very complicated and struggling experience for the beginners but it is a must for the fans of the series.Ayrıca ""benim sadık yarim kara topraktır""			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is bad. But it is that cheesy kind of bad which everybody (OK, die-hard fans of Disciples) like. I suppose the guys tried to sort of remake the Disciples II but got short on money halfway through. In Reincarnation you get no playable Dwarves but you get see and play your good ol' undead and demons and humans from DII. Buuut, the units are imbalanced which is topped by a fiendish in-game interface and bugged scripts which render the some missions incompletable. But hey, bugs, interfacece and level scaling (yep, seriously the game expects you to topple 30level enemy during first campaigns mission when you max level is 5) aside, the storyline seems pretty enjoyable so far.

												Okay, if you’re going to transform the game into Heroes Of Might and Magic, try at least not to make same mistakes. Though, Disciples is NO Heroes, it will never be Heroes nor it needs to be. The 2D and Pseudo 3D aspects of Disciples II, I loved every bit of it so F…ck very much for ruining it. I don’t like the artwork, also the interactive objects in the game world are hardly identifiable, yes it takes some getting used to however the game lost all the Disciples appeal that attracted me in the first place. To stupid devs - more textures and fancy 3D does not necessarily mean a better game, it’s time for you to learn that.			",27,5,0,12,2,0,1

												It's alright I mean. The combat becomes tedious and kind of boring. Honestly might be worth a skip, the story is pretty meh too. Don't expect your leaders to do much of anything. The enemies will have 1000 hp and your leader can only hit 10-25. In 8 hours of playing I have only hit a few bugs. One made it so that I was stuck on act one for a long time.

												Reincarnation is how Disciples III should have been in the first release. It’s the best Disciples experience so far IMHO after Disciples II, with a much better tactical system, advanced graphics, another great atmospheric soundtrack along with more detailed RPG elements on commanders. So as some others also expressed in other comments, it is truly an advanced Disciples II on every end. It is indeed a pity the studio bankrupted and couldn’t last long enough to continue improvements over its current state. Even though most bugs are fixed, it is missing the unfinished but crucial DLC i.e. Mountain Clans which was an essential part of all previous Disciples sagas, therefore, limiting your overall experience with the game. This is the only reason why I cut off 1 point of my total score => 9/10    A true disciples fan should not miss this one in their collection. ",457,125,15,82,74,6,140

												... What the ♥♥♥♥. Seriously, I've liked the Disciples series since I played Sacred Lands, and this is a steaming pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥on the franchise/world lore. If you're interested in the series, get Disciples one or two. Damn this whole thing is confusing, can't make heads or tails of which version is supposed to be the most current of the three, not that I really care at this point. Who writes a game where it doesn't matter if you win, when you still lose? Not sure about the other races, but the Empire storyline is summed up by: Saw a falling star, found the 'messiah girl' in the crater, escorted her until we die and the Legions grab her. It's not even written well enough to be entertaining despite that.			",27,22,0,34,1,0,3

												Well, I loved Disciples II. I played the game for countless hours. I loved the artwork, I loved the races, I loved the gameplay. It was a great, darker alternative to that other fantasy strategy/RPG game. There was just something about the game that enthralled me. I really wanted the next installment to be like the second. Unfortunately, it's not.It looks like the AI is basically set up in such a manner that the higher the difficulty, the more your units just plain suck at combat.First encounter into the game, my units miss more than they hit. Miss, miss, miss. That's what I saw in the first encounter. And the second. And the third.The problem is, there's nothing I can do tactically to change this. I can jump on the focus points all I want in combat, but if my units still just whiff every time, I've got no chance. And if the enemy pounced on the focus points before I have a chance to? Well, forget it.I've played the game for a couple of hours, and already I just plain despise it. I don't mind losing if it's because of the wrong tactical choices I've made, but when I've got no chance as a LVL 1 party because we just miss every time, forget it. I'm done.I wanted to love this game because I adored the predecessors. This one just makes me never want to play it again.			",71,9,1,28,4,1,22

They also added new content and fixed lots of bugs.This game has a good story, a dark theme that's even reflected in the UI of it...like the previous versions of it.The game is a little difficult for beginners, but a good challenge for those that know how to play TBS games.And by the way it has nothing related to Heroes of Might and Magic. IT'S NOT A CLONE OF IT!!! Damn, look at a dictionary before, they can be compared but they have their own style.I could explain features or combat, or even give spoilers, but there are enough videos and screenshots around....but why looking at them!?

												I already own 2 copies of Renaissance - one purchased at Amazon to get the non-updated, non-broken version so I could finish the thing - and 1 of Resurrection - which I've never finished because of all the bugginess and the way the Undead Hordes are so underpowered and handicapped it isn't even funny. Even so, I went ahead and purchased this based on the positive reviews that indicated a lot of the issues have been resolved. I expected simply a better working, better balanced version of the original but I'm happy to say that this is an entirely different game all the way around. Not sure I'm happy with the new battle mechanics, though, but I suppose I'll get used to it. I can already tell that the balance for the Empire army has drastically changed - not nearly as overpowered as it was, which gives me hope that perhaps the balance of the Legions and the Undead Hordes has improved so that they aren't so weak. On the other hand, I will probably not use auto-combat in this one as much as I did in the others. My army tends to get decimated if I'm not in control.Another hope is that I won't experience as many crashes as before, although the game did freeze up after one battle. Once I got the game to minimize, there was a low memory warning on the screen that doesn't make sense since my computer is built to be a gaming computer with as much gaming power as HP could give it. Also have to mention the opening, which is phenomenal. Much better than the original. The storyline seems much improved as well. Kind of makes me wish I could read Russian so I could read the book that was written based on the game.Despite the nerfed battle system (only my opnion, though), I believe this is going to be $30 well spent and I do recommend the game.

												Few tings WHY not to buy this game.1. This is NOT Disciples anymore. It's just another sh*tty Heores clone.Balance is re-done according to ""chessboard"" change, and - not really recalculated properly. Now it sucks.Where's the WHOLE F*CKING IDEA OF A CHESSBOARD WITH ONLY 6 SLOTS GODDAMIT????The one, that was building up the whole gameplay you know, the one htat was requiring for you to calculate your army carefully, and use every single possibility to overcome your  opponent?And what's with these special spots on the battlefield?I mean, comoooooon... Shoot me at least 2 differences from heroes? Can you? Different sprites??? Or Uglier GUI???Jeesus, Disciples was one of the BEST, and from my perspective - mainly because of this unique and interesting balance idea of a chessboard.Now - disciples has nothing to offer except a bug reports, and ugly... graphics. And really poor storyline of course too.2. Akella, aaaah Akella... The WORST releaser in the world keeps up with it's own ""fame""...I am trying to get trough first level of Demons for a f*cking week already... Crashes ALL the time.From my previous experience of communicating with them about some crashes - it just do not work.They *usualy* just don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about customer.I really do not remember even single ""OK"" release by that company, not to speak of ""Good"" ones.If only I would take care and read about that they are involved BEFORE I bought this game - I simply wouldn't. It's sooo obvious, that if the game is marked by that publisher - it just wouldn't work.			",150,5,0,22,4,0,17
