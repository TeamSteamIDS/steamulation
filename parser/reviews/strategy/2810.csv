												After years of playing on and off again with over 500 hours both on and off Steam under my belt, I can say this is my favorite game. This won't be universal, though, as the game has a very large learning gap and very little instruction, coupled with a format of gameplay that is best discribed as ""love it or hate it"". The lack of a tutorial doesn't help.For those wondering if this is worth playing or buying, one must ask themselved what do they want first. Do you want to be a pirate in space firing on ships outside of the areas controlled by the law, and don't mind the high dificulty? Do you want to spend many hours trading items from one station to another to gain money and eventually buy your own states, hiring ships to trade for you and leading your new found corporate empire to grand wealth? Do you want to explore the universe, and all it's mystory and see it's dark secrets, with all the risks that may bring? Do you want to be a cop, shooting down pirates, evil robots, evil incests and whom ever else may oppose order?This and much more is in the game.However: if you want instant gratification, always playing at a fast pace, or everything being handed to you?Then this game is not for you.This game isn't for those who want to just jump in and do everything quickly, it's a slow buildup that some will find enjoyable and some will find unbearable.

												As a programmer, any game that lets you actually create ""software"" to manage your space-trade-fleets, has got a leg up already.  While I'm not  fan of the ""jump-gate"" type galaxies, that is probably my only complaint about this game.  Individual combat is fun, but I have yet to build a combat fleet, so I'm not sure how that will go.  The economic system is quite impressives, with dozens of different space stations you can dock at, and trade with.  Eventually you can even build stations of your own.  The game lacks a good tutorial, built into the main plot, so I was fumbling around quite a bit for a while.  But once I got the hang of things,  you can really see how well the various components of the game work together.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game appears to be working fine since it was bugged at it's first release. Although the navigation and space stations seem a bit more awkward compared to the original and X2. But the most interesting part is more weapons, ships and hidden secrets within this game.This game does have a flat learning curve, but you maybe best to try the Original X Beyond The Frontier, first.You may get used to it over time, but you never know - as you may find this game not so boring as you got lots to explore the galaxy. And this game is open-ended and never stops, despite its linear storyline.If you are keen to learn or find some spoilers to avoid any long-term mistakes in your space campaign, you best looking in the EgoSoft forums. Don't use any mods or any cheats that will permenently modify and corrupt your saves and stats, if you are that fussed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ah the X Series. I haven't heard anything good about rebirth the latest installment to the series but this review isnt about that. X3: Reunion Was the game that turned me on to the whole series. In fact just thinking about it now is making me want to sink even more hours into a title i have already sank more than what would commonly be called healthy gaming. Once you get past the steep learning curve and learn how to fly and fight and trade effectively, this game suddenly turns into how you would want to live in a future that affords you your own space oddesy. Space suddenly turns into your own playground and you become immersed in a universe that is fully dynamic. With that said i think this title, X3 Terran conflict and X3 Albion Prelude were accidental. Terran conflict takes place after the events of this title, and adds a Major graphics overhaul. And prelude again expands on the story of Terran conflict as well as this title adding features and interfaces that were touched on in this title but done poorly. It is pretty evident the beauty of this game and the other X3 titles is the immersion of the struggle you are put through to learn, and adapt to the changes that happen around you all while getting the sense of achievement from overcoming and growing from the experiences you encounter. What these games lack is a sense of person however. You sort of create a character or take on a storyline however you rarely interact as that character. You never really see the character and the universe usually refers to you as pilot. In Reunion, the main story you play as julian brennan. working along side Elena Kho. Trying to find your place in the universe. There is an extensive storyline and it all seems to fit very well all things considered.  The other characters however offer a backstory as to why you start out where you do, and how the other races react to you in the beginning.  Ultimately it defines how difficult the game is in the beginning to get started. Once you get on a roll however and you grow all plots start and play out no matter who you play as with the exception of Julian's plot. his has a little more frosting so to speak. Otherwise its all essentially the same. Reunion is also of the three X3 games that has a main character. Terran Conflict and Prelude do not feature main plot character who playing as change the dialogue or offer any additional content. Pros:Dynamic Universe - Everything you do or not do effects the universe in some way.Rich plots - The back story to each of the plots are very compelling and their rewards give a strong sense of achievementDiverse spacecraft - Each ship has its own classification as well as strength and weaknesses. Even some that are unique and rare. Races - Each race is unique in its own way and their ships fit the typical role the races engage in.Fleets - You can build, or buy your own fleet and wage war against anything within the universe, ofcourse doing so will have consquences such as you may end up destroying something you want later. The good news is there is one race you can attack and murder with extreme prejudice and not have to worry about losing a future trading station. Cons:Voice acting - Its there but at the time this game was released other studios did it better. Races - While each race is unique there is nothing unique among their individuals. Humans however occasionally have diversity among males and females but you will be hard pressed telling a male or female split, paranid or teladi. No planetary exploration. The planets in each system are just there to look pretty it seems. No station exploration. Each station you only dock at and interact with through the ship. From what i understand Rebirth attempted at affording planetary and staion exploration however at the cost of starship diversity. Further more these features were not done well and as such losing the ability to fly and construct a diverse fleet was too great of a sacrifice against bland cookie cutter stations.

												X3 Reunion is a game of monstrous proportions. Everything in it is vast and massive in a way that's both exciting and daunting. It is relatively easy to get overwhelmed by the sheer scope of the game and the lack of any sort of proper guiding hand to teach you the basic will make many newcomers run for the hills. If you stick it out however you will find that underneath it all is one of the best open space games since the last game from the X series.Reunion picks up where X2 left off and starts you as Julian Brennan once again. Your trade empire from the previous game destroyed by the Khaak you now have to resurrect it from the ashes, if that's what you want. The story missions available are in true X style utterly forgettable and easily missable. They can even be disabled entirely by picking from one of several sandbox starts this time around.As always you start you start your adventure in the X universe in a small dingy of a space worthy craft and set about making your mark on the galaxy. How you do this is entirely up to you, you can trade, fight, explore however you like and in whichever forms you want. Some players might want to avoid the fighting aspect entirely and just set up a gigantic trading empire. Others might want to sustain themselves through pirate activity. The beauty of the X games have always been the choice they give you in going what you want to do, you are never forced to fight or forced to trade, it's all entirely up to you how you want to proceed from any given position.Reunion is not without it's faults however and in this case, it's the bugs top the list. The game was almost completely unplayable at launch and while patches have managed to remove most if not all of the problems it is still not an issue that is so easily forgivable.Graphically is where the game is truly impressive however, never before has space looked this beautiful and the objects that inhabit it looked this crisp. Every new sector you visit has a sense of uniqueness about it that just makes you want to keep going to see what's in the next one. The ships are beautifully detailed and the background ambient images of stars, nebulae and planets tickle the imagination. This is indeed one stunning visual experience.The soundtrack is the standard space opera opus that we have heard so many times before, it doesn't detract anything from the experience but it doesn't add anything to it either. Luckily it is easy enough to disable the ingame music and put whatever you feel is appropriate on the stereo. The voice acting you encounter throughout the game, from the missions to your ships onboard computer voice, is downright atrocious however and take you out of the game with an annoying level of certainty.All in all X3 Reunion is a solid continuation of the X saga, building on the foundations that has remained mostly unchanged since the very first game. Should you desire an open ended space epic then this is the game for you. If you have the stamina to get into the learn the ropes then X3 is as good as it gets, at least until the next X game is released.			",980,332,42,138,118,11,215

												If you're looking for a hardcore gamer's game, you found it! An excellent sandbox space sim, with an interesting universe to explore, regardless of how you choose to play the game. Be prepared for a steep learning curve though, this is the most player-hostile game I've played. Newcomers might be better off with some of the newer X3 games (Terran Conflict or Albion Prelude). Graphics still looks beautiful today, 10 years after the game was released.			",36,16,0,5,2,0,7

												This is a game.  It looks like a game, it acts like a game, it even plays like a game.  You press buttons to move, you press buttons to shoot, you can even press buttons to do other stuff and there's lots of stuff to do. You can build stuff, you can build stuff that builds stuff AND you can build stuff that blows stuff up.  You can attach stuff that blows stuff up to stuff that moves, and you can make stuff that moves move around stuff that doesn't.  You can also watch the stuff you buillt up blow other stuff up, OR you can fly around in stuff you put stuff on and blow stuff up yourself.  It takes time to get some stuff done, and you do need patience to play if you want the best stuff or even a lot of stuff... even longer if you want a lot of the best stuff... but when you get a lot of the best stuff and throw it at a load of other stuff, the stuff that happens is pretty awesome stuff.  So if you like a game with lots of stuff and no singular direction to do stuff in, then this stuff is for you.			",32,1,0,7,4,0,11

												Ok, first off, I have never played any of the X series until now. X3: Reunion is amazing beyond beleif. Yes, the learning curve might be too difficult for some, but for others, this is amazing. The open world universe is amazing, AND it runs 40-70 fps on my NETBOOK. My INTEGRATED CELERON GRAPHICS NETBOOK! But, this game NEEDS a tutorial! And a quicksave feature. I would recommend this to all my friends, and I recommend it to all of you! Here is a pro/ con list:Pros: +Amazing open world+Combat is great+Story line, while predicatable, is actually decent+Good trading systemCons:-No tutorial-NO AUTOPAUSE WHEN PRESSING ESC!!!-NO WORKSHOPE SUPPORT. With this, people could create their own GALAXIES, and upload them for other people to play!!!All in all, GET IT NOW!			",232,27,3,17,17,0,12

												I still love this game. For those like me, who like super deep games with tons of complexity, this game and the other X games are the best of the best imo. The controls suck, but I can forgive that to enjoy the detail and depth that this game offers.This is not your pew pew game where you blow up entire fleets in your tin can with lasers. This game has economic, diplomatic, combat, black market, exploration, empire building, strategy, and so many more aspects its amazing. This game is like a living galaxy within your computer. Biggest problem this game suffers imo is the learning curve. You can expect that the first few sittings with this game are going to frusterate you. If you can get past that, you'll enjoy the same complexity that frusterated you to begin with.			",19,4,0,4,3,0,8

												One of my top favorite games, still play it now five years after I bought it. Great atmosphere and many things to do. It's up to you how you want to play it. Have fun.Behind a tricky to learn interface lies a beauty of a game, with great space combat and trading, well worth learning the controls, once you've got them down you'll be flying through all the different menus easily. Build up a commercial empire, or a large mlitary force of hundreds of ships, build stations, complexes (lots of stations all together), smuggle illegal drugs such as Spaceweed, slaves or alcholol, explore the universe for hidden goodies (ships and other goods), or just explore the universe. Capture ships to add to your own fleet or sell. You can even just be a pirate, and do piraty things.			",41,3,0,16,1,1,15

												This is a great sandbox space game (it has been described as a one-player version of Eve Online). A good mix between exploration, trading, and combat, with a largely optional story-line. The story is a bit confusing to people who haven't played X2, but it's a minor portion of the game.Definately one you will want to read the manual (and guide) for as it is fairly complicated. Things like sector/universe trading and complex construction are essential for mid/late game money making, but poorly explained (or not at all!) in-game.			",130,218,0,17,36,0,13

												An astonishingly beautiful, deeply complex space simulator. The X series have always ruled the economy-based space sim genre and Reunion is no exception. It provides a large universe swarming with life as tons of AI controlled ships each mind their own bussiness and freighters trading wares between stations, affecting the ware prices, which makes the economy quite dynamic and feeling real. Your actions will always have consequences- if you destroy a trader ship, it will not arrive to it's destination and the station will not receive the wares it needs to construct it's products. These were always the core features of X games, just like it's amazing and calming soundtrack, detailed and unique sector backgrounds and intricate 3D models, making it a piece of art. You will notice many tracks ported from the previous X games, aswell as many new ones- my favourite is Home of Light, Kingdom's End and Seizewell sector music.So what's unique about Reunion, when compared to the other X games? Well to be honest, I enjoyed the older X2: The Threat way more. It's atmosphere was just a bit different, it's interface control was quicker to control, you weren't forced to use a mouse occasionally and could do everything much quicker through keyboard or a flightstick/gamepad (which I really recommend for X3). It's a-life also seemed more detailed as every station had it's set of fighter and freighter ships, each with their corresponding orders. Here in Reunion, everything is replaced with universe traders, which are randomly spawned freighters with commands to endlessly seek the best deals and don't really belong to anyone. After I couldn't find a single station that owns at least one ship, I thought it's a bug. The interface of Reunion is difficult to get around at first and lacks propper organisation. Widescreens weren't so common back then so the windows aren't taking much space either, although there are no issues (except the main menu). There are also no station hangar interiors like they were in X2. Ships now usually dock from outside instead, into a limited number of ship holders. The speed of all spaceships is also reduced so the usage of the time acceleration becomes a must.Don't forget to visit the Egosoft forums, for mods and gameplay guides. X-Tended Mod (XTM) is probably the biggest one, but if you want to play the X games sequentially and take on Terran Conflict later, then it may spoil you lots of content as it ports most of the ships and stations from it. The cockpit mod is also really good because defaultly there are no cockpits in Reunion, unlike at X2. New Horizons seems like a nice alternative to XTM. Another great mod is CMOD II, which adds more immersive  sounds and Military HUD which.If you're looking for a good space sim gameplay and don't care about the X story, skip this game and go directly for X3 Albion Prelude. If you haven't played the previous X games before, then Reunion is probably the worst one to start with and I would rather try the X2 for it's in-game tutorial that the X3 games lack. X3TC/AP could also be easy to start with if you don't mind reading some user made guides instead.Speaking about the whole X series, Reunion is probably the worst one. The only good thing it brought to the series were updated graphics, which can still be called quite eye-candy today. Other than that, it's campaign is is about 20-40 hours long (depending on your X game experience) and I recommend playing it if you want to follow up with the story.			",54,2,0,2,8,0,2

												This game is what it promises - a Sandbox. you can do many things here, be a trader, a hired gun, a pirate hunter or hero of the universe. you can build stations, manufacturing complexes, wage war with the empires, and with help of the mod even take them over completely. you can own sectors and much more. If you want freedom and reactive economy - this is a game for you.It has its downsides as well however. For one, be prepared to sink in a lot of time into it. and i mean 100+ hours. the game moves slow, and if you pick a regular start youll spend your first couple real life days scrapping the bottom for cash. The unbalanced missions and bad UI does not help much here, however once you start to get bigger, have regional traders hired, start building stations you can devote yourself to more fun stuff - exterminating enemy systems.Overall the game is pretty good, but it is by far not perfect. if you want to have basically same game, but more refined, your better off playing X3: Terran Conflict			",82,5,0,10,15,1,28

												Overly complicated controls and menus give this game a high learning curve, and you spend a lot of time just waiting to get from point A to point B even with the time accelerators. It is definitely more user friendly than X or X2 and if you are willing to invest a lot of time then you can do a lot in the game. The tutorial info is very limited so be prepared to learn on your own. I can't say I would recommend it, but if you enjoy the X series already then I think you would like it and it is easier to begin with X3 than X or X2 in my opinion; however, I'd suggest you to start with X3 Terran Conflict if you are going to start anywhere.

												I play this when it was originaly released.  Picked it up again to finish the story line  and becaue I like the game.  It is a bit quirky, and I am having hangups on occasions.  Perhaps the conversion to the modern operating systems is less than 100%			",4,0,0,0,2,0,4

												This is a really tough review to write as I really wanted this game to be great.  I am still a big fan of X-Tension and after the disappointment of X2, I hoped this game had brought X back to its roots.  Things started out fine I guess but as with many things the devil was in the detail.  Perhaps it's just my playing style that's the problem but generally I found the game to be quite frustrating in many areas.Let's discuss the good parts first though.The graphics were fantastic.   It was great to have new models for the bases that provided you with both the wow factor and a subtle sense of familiarity at the same time.  I liked the fact that many of the bases were exactly where they were to be found in X.  Obviously the Khaak war had had an impact and that was to be expected but navigation was less of an issue than I thought it was going to be.  I also like the fact that the trading ships you set up for your bases don't seem to travel into sectors where you haven't been.  Makes it easy for ships not to get caught up in conflict that way, although that still happens as we'll discuss later.  Once you learn the new interface, it's remarkably similar to what has come before.  That (for me at least) meant that the learning curve was not as steep as it could have been because of the known complexity of the game.  Once the game was started, many of the basics were identical and it was the kind of game that I could seriously get into because I understood what was required and how to start making money.Sector traders was another advance I thought very useful.  Being able to assign a ship to a sector then just let it find good trading deals and execute them for money was a great idea.  Didn't always work very well but then I seemed to be competing with every AI trader in the sector also; very realistic, but not a lot of fun.The combat model seemed to be upgraded and I liked it a lot as the weapons worked more like those I'd seen on other games like Freelancer.  Not having to stop and adjust for recoil all the time was a bonus and in that sense, the game flowed a lot better than X.The single biggest improvement to the game was docking.  You didn't need the docking computer to make things easier like you did in X because docking seriously wasn't that hard.  No longer was docking a perilous affair for a budding pilot; it was quite forgiving so long as you weren't reckless.Unfortunately, there were many aspects of the game that were 'upgraded' causing unanticipated issues.  While docking was in fact my favourite upgrade, it caused other problems.  Ships were now vulnerable on the outside of their stations.  This was no doubt by design, but it meant that there was no 'safe' place to park.  In addition, every docking ring had 5 slots on it so you couldn't park all your spare ships there without disrupting trade or having some of your ships pushed off the ring from time to time.  Additionally, the AI driving the ships (particularly wingmen) didn't handle the parking very well which meant that I was regularly losing wingmen who crashed into the station I'd docked at by accident.  Docking had become great for me but hopeless for any ship I wasn't personally driving which caused me no small amount of frustration.  Additionally, in X I was used to having a small fleet of wingmen around me and I couldn't do that in this game because I would just jam up the docking ring.  Given that your player ship is exposed, wouldn't it have made more sense for the wingmen to switch to patrolling outside the station instead?Then there's the Corvettes.  You're supposed to be able to dock a M5 fighter on them.  Nope.  Doesn't seem to work.  Not sure what that's about but I couldn't EVER get that to work.  As a side point, back on the old THQ forum (under the handle Acid) I suggested a ship of this kind originally; could dock a single small ship, have a reasonably large cargo hold and still be combat effective.  You couldn't imagine my delight at actually being able to fly one; I planned to use the M5 as a resource collector as I took mine through space.  Too bad it just never worked out. Loved those ships but it was a shame they didn't perform as advertised.That of course leads to the Reputation system.  Sure you can buy our ships; so long as you're at a particular level with us.  Actually, I understand that one.  I was surprised it wasn't in X in the first place; but, it was very frustrating nonetheless to have to build up reputation with a specific race to buy their good stuff.  I'm not against the idea but it would have been great to have a system option to turn it either on or off.System fog was to me one of the poorest choices that could have been made.  I understand the benefit it gives in some systems but I'm not always playing to overcome such challenges.  I would have been happy with no fog, or an option to turn it off.Finally, there was the ship models.  While the stations had been dramatically improved, the ships all looked like modern houses; same structure and internal design, different facade on the outside to make them stand out.  Yes, I liked the original models but it's more than just a case of nostalgia; it was the diversity of ship design that stood out for me with the original X.  In this new one, with the exception of the Boron ships you would be hard placed to notice anything but superficial design differences between the races.  Even ships within the race seemed only to significantly differ in scale.Don't get me wrong; I liked the game.  I liked the atmosphere, I liked most of the game mechanics except those mentioned above.  I just found the game a bit of a struggle because of the small niggles that make it difficult to play.  In some respects, X has joined the ranks of Master of Orion (IMHO) in forming a new genre of game only to make it harder to play in every subsequent iteration through over-complication.  MOO (the original) is still a great game, and I still play it despite owning 2 and 3 (and several other 4x games).  At this stage, I suspect I'll be saying the same thing about X-Tension.  I'll still be playing that in years to come (probably with an emulator named something like WinBox on a 256-bit cloud OS) instead of X3.  That will be a shame because this game got a lot right.  It was just a little too complicated and clunky in spots.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Total play time: 43 hours before I gave up in disgust.Crashes: too many to count.The good: lovely graphics. (When you can see them beside the immovable overlay screens.)The really ugly:Worst user interface of any game I've EVER played. Confusing. Redundant. And impossible to actually FIND anything if you don't already know EXACTLY where it is.Flight mechanics: ships in space aren't air fighters. or worse cars in mud.  Why can't SPACE simulations get this right?  If I shut off the engines, I don't just bloody stop. I keep going. But not in this game. Freelancer got it right, and it made space combat FUN. Others never seem to have learned the lesson. If I want an air-based dogfight game, I'll go get that, not a game that's theoretically based in space.Mouse resolution seem to be hard-coded rather than depending on operating system settings, then they don't give you a means to reduce the sensitivity. So if you have a high resolution mouse, hope you like making micrometre movements to control things. Or go with a joystick, which isn't nearly as precise - and you have to be VERY precise when shooting because there's zero give.Stupidly high learning curve, and (almost) zero tutorial. Examples:-- In the FIRST tutorial (simulator) mission, you're told ""don't forget to activate your turret"" - and left with ZERO instructions on how to do that. You're on your own trying to figure out what you need. I did eventually figure it out, several hours into the game, and the answer is nowhere NEAR the weapon options panel they provide. -- They give you a jump drive? You have to ""just know"" that you need lots of energy crystals for it, and where and how to get them. -- Want to activate your jump drive? You better ""just know"" that it's going to make you stop in space with a big flashing ""Hi, I'm a target"" for a while. So although the enemy can jump as soon as they're in trouble, you trying to do so means certain death.-- Want to buy something? Who created that interface? Wasn't anyone with any kind of user interface knowledge. -- Want to do some trading? Well, it seems you don't have the trading interface. Except you DO have the trading interface, says so right in your ship inventory. Finally discovered that it's not the right LEVEL of trading interface, which is given a different name in the error message than it has in the inventory. Again, you just have to know. -- The list goes on, and on, and on. Sadly, most of the online advice is written by people who HAVE that encyclopaeodic knowledge and forgot that they didn't once have it. -- Regularly throughout the campaign you're told ""meet you at XXX"". Without being given ANY hints as to where it might be. Having to go to external sources just so you can actually figure out where you're supposed to next is definitely poor design.-- Attempting to build a ""factory complex"" is an exercise in frustration since the positioning controls were done by someone who had never, ever used any kind of CAD program. It's what I'd expect out of a novice doing a project for a Bachelor level graphics class, and even then they probably wouldn't get a good grade. It's not something I would ever have expected out of a commercial product such as this one.-- The list of faults goes on, and on, and on.And, finally, the kicker: the storyline breaks. Hard. With no way to figure out how the hell to fix it. Mission 7, finding the crystals, your contact doesn't show up where they're supposed to be, which means no way to continue. Since I've spent several hours between the previous mission and this one trying to earn enough credits to get a better ship, I have NO idea where it might have gone wrong.  I might as well have started one of the ""no storyline"" missions, because this one is now totally hooped.Not to mention crash after crash after crash making game (almost) unplayable. Latest one? You finish a long mission (only the 2nd or 3rd one) with zero chance of saving and... it just hangs there, staring at the piece the Talon just dropped, keyboard locked. Did I mention no chance of saving and no quick-saves so you have to repeat the whole, long, frustrating experience rather than restart from further along the mission line.  Worse, apparently there's a way to save without docking, as I was reminded by the game when it misinterpreted my ""fire at the enemy"" for ""save this game"", but I was defeated in trying to figure out where or how to purchase the necessary bits and pieces to make it possible. I'm pretty good at figuring things out usually, but this game is that obtuse.I was REALLY looking forward to playing this game. But as it stands, it's an unplayable mash of crap that requires an encyclopaedic knowledge of the game JUST TO PLAY THE FIRST BLOODY MISSIONS! I'm sure the game is fun for those who took the hours and hours to develop that encyclopaedic knowledge required to do even the most basic tasks in the game. For someone like me who doesn't mind some complexity, but would rather just get in and play before I'm hit with the whole enchilada, this game isn't for me. Or for anyone else who feels that it shouldn't be necessary to digest a 96 page manual, megabytes of online information, and go through several hours of online learning just to complete the first few missions.Annoying. Very annoying.edit: 8-Mar: yet I still intend to master this game. Yes, it's annoying in so many ways, but hopefully once I *have* acquired the required encyclopaedic knowledge (or at least a portion thereof) it gets better? Certainly has promise, I just hope it can realize that promise.edit: 11-Mar: after trying for many hours to get this game to work, all I can say is ""no, not for me"". If you want a game that takes hours of research just to START the game, and many more hours of external out-of-game research to even have a hope in hell of doing anything, then you might try this game. If you want something fun, not frustrating in the extreme, and something that doesn't resemble more of an office job than a ""game"", stay away. Far, far away. Personally, I'm giving up in disgust.

That being said, it's slow-paced, and has a very steep learning curve compared to most games out there.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bought this game when it first came out and played it till the disk broke - played TC AND AP then saw it on steam and grabbed it again, don't be fooled by the negative reviews, this ISN'T an arcade game and it ISN'T a hold your hand and give you everything after the 1st try, it's a beautiful sim. there are people saying they didn't know what to do in the game...well thats what the manual is for >.< as for it being hard work or more like work than a game, well that part i don't understand. once you get the hang of flying everything else is easy it just takes time to get everything you need. i was able to get my first station after 3 hours of play and tooo many close calls to mention and a second station a few hours later. Like alot of games out there this one gets even better with mods and there are soooo many to chose from it's insane.want your own sector ? want your own empire? want to wage war on another empire? go for it with the mods game play is extanded in amazing directions.but remember this is a sim and it takes time and planning to get these things even with mods. if you're looking for arcade try freelancer or if you want everything for free you can beg for gold in stormwind but if you want a GREAT sim that lets you build an empire from one ship this is the game for you.ps. trading isn't the only way to get money to build an empire, you can easily get it through combat (bounty hunting / pirating) although running missions and personal trans takes ALOT longer.

												EgoSoft has almost completely redone the interface, but managed to keep the same feel for the game (in my opinion). This 3rd installment is not without bugs however. In fact its probably the most buggy version, with ships crashing into asteroids, gates, stations and eachother at a regular basis (even without SETA), missions (both story and incidental) not loading as intended or not configured properly.I have come to expect the usual interuptions mid-combat by your employees and wingmen, but in this version they actually tried to do something about it. The interuptions are better planned and the player is put out of harms way when control is taken away, which means that if you die before, during or after a cut-scene or whatever it will probably be your own fault (this time).The universe has become a lot more vibrant and exciting and the dynamics are just as interesting as they were before. With new weapons, a new generation of craft for all species and new products there is again a lot to explore and learn. Not to mention the more involved pirating and policing one can do in name of one government or another.The main story, however, does not yield any reward other than an ore mine in Paranid space, but can be played in full with the ship you start with (On Normal, the Argon Buster), which throws the story-line even more to the sideline. I concider that a setback, but only that. The story itself is just as interesting and informative as one would expect from the previous installments and it extends it real nice.

Needing to be a business logistical expert to play the game....is not. Really hard to get into. I loved jumping into the game and playing, growing and expanding, but i found myself working rather than playing. And no multiplayer for ""reasons"" that the community sucks about ""blah blah blah stuff wouldn't work right blah blah blah it would become EVE Online."" 1/10 would rather make real money for the time i am working with this game.

												It looks like a really fun game.  I even watched some youtube gameplay before buying.  However, there are absolutely no instructions or tutorials.  Not even an online manual.  It makes the game almost unplayable.  There is no quest log, instead you have to dig down inside the messages to find out what you are supposed to do.  Of course, with no tutorial or manual, you have no idea what the keys are so that takes time.  Pretty much the whole game is like that.  Very disappointing.  I'm a huge fan of freelancer and all the X games feel like they could be a sequel, but right now I just can't recommend.			",66,4,0,18,0,0,4

												In essence a very good game that is the spiritual successor to Elite. A reletively steep learning curve for a new comer to the series but there are plenty orf tutorials on Youtube and  on the Egosoft forums for help.Combat especially when piloting fighters seems quite reasonable so far. The interface is only slightly differrant compared to the later expansions of Terran Conflict and Albion Prelude and is not clunky in use. For referance I'm currently playing campaigns in both Reunion and Albion Prelude.It might be said that the only reason to get Reunion these days is if you want to play the plot especially if you have the other two expansions. Which might be valid for some but I like Reunion for the lack of money early in the game compared to the later titles as it really gives you a sense of achievement further on. As well as various differculty settings starting the main plot {in regards to starting money etc} You are also given alternative starts of the Humble Merchant, Bankrupt Assasin, the explorer and a custom start. These ignore the plot and are perfect for a total sand box experience. Though these are not as many as contained in x3:TC and x3:APReunion is more than just a space trading and fighting sim as it is also a strategy game at heart that you can build your own industrial or millitary empire or even both.If you can't afford Terran Conflict and/or Albion Prelude Reunion is a good place to start.

												aahhhhh space......a very complex game, highly reccomend a trainer or go to youtube and see what to do, or walkthrough guide to help you out on this, i still somewhat thinks its ok, but em....ill let you be the judge of that.OK back to this review, i did not give it much justice it deserved, you can start up your own trade routes and get merchants doing all the trading for you after awhile of you doing your own trading, and eventually they level up to universal traders, they go to multiple sectors to do trades, upon doing so they get better and better and soon after start trading around some of the most expensive type of stuff, after all that you by now should be a rich tradesmen out there and can then make your OWN STATIONS....how awesome is that :D then you really start raking in more creds and then you start building fleets......ooooh it gets good...this game...is a 10/10 in my opinion, though its highly recommended by many to play its expansions which i think are albion prelude/ terran conflict? I havent gotten to them yet, but so far this game is great, though lacks that of a tutorial.....sooo it will be a must to read up on some how to guides.			",259,19,2,43,36,1,68

												I found myself in a system that had one large planet with a moon, looking very similar to Earth. I decided I was going to fly my Mamba spacecraft right into that damned moon, or die trying. After about 10 real-time minutes of flying full speed towards the moon I got bored and ejected from my ship, needless to say my ship wound up about 500 meters ahead of me after the jump. I went full speed in my space suit towards my ship, intending to get back on board and keep at that ol' moon who now seemed to be taunting me for my stupidity. As my ship got closer I reralized I was coming in too hot. ""No problem,"" I confidently stated, ""I'll simply slow down."" Upon pressing the key to decelerate I realized it was too late, and my suit slammed face first into the hull. That was it, I had died at the hands of my own eagerness to end my life by ramming a moon with a spaceship.  10/10 Would definitely die by crashing into my own spaceship again			",16,1,0,7,5,0,1

												Recommended for the average hardcore masochist. 10 semesters gameplay study at egosoft is NOT included4 X game (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate)In this game 4 X translates to:- extract all infos from the web (the manual can't really help you)- extreme frustrating on normal difficult level- extra slow gameplay- exceed your patience ",66,12,6,8,11,0,9

												This is the best gaem ever. I dunno where to start. You can fly ships, trade, raid solar systems, shoot, capture other ships, use frigates, freight transporters, capital ships, do missions. Keep in mind that this is certainly a quick-save game which doesn't have quick-save functionality. There is a slight chance you will crash trying to dock (using auto-pilot), there is a chance you will crash into a M2-class ship coming out of warp gate. There is a chance you will turn into flying wreckage by trying to claim other ship. Those bugs make it extremely autistic, cryptic and annoying (at times) but still fun and very addictive. Number of possibilities, ways to earn credits, recognition and ships is just beyond my comprehension. This game takes about 5 hours to get the basics and I'm not even joking.			",179,34,4,29,12,1,30

												Nice entry in the X - Series, trade aspects feel pretty realistic, exploration gives that joy of finding either unclaimed ship, or ware after many hours of searching through abyss, micro-management of owned complex lines and stations. However, combat could be more challenging, where AI shows its lack of power, or should i say, lack of control over its own ship other then access to command console. Also, be warned of steep learning curves and long play times. Despite that, i recommend that game to anyone who can overcome those obstacles, because behind that a unique experience awaits you, that can be even more enhanced by modding/scripting.

												Beautiful, vast universe in a game offering seeminly endless opportunity...the problem is no tutorial, no instructions and apparently no point/purpose. Add to this one of the most user unfriendly interfaces I have ever battled with in a game where every single key (and I mean every single key) on the keyboard is needed to do something in game, be it control the ship, communicate, trade or whatever, a little in game training would have been mildly useful. Forget a steep learning curve,  this is tendon twistingly ballistic - that's ok, but no fun. Games are at their heart suppose to be enjoyable. I only managed 5 hrs before it robbed me of my will to live.Another word of warning, as others have mentioned in forums about this game, it takes time for things to start to happen( obviously longer than 5 hrs), it's not a jump right in and its all action after 15 mins, no, not this one. And that's fair enough for a complex space adventure/trade/sim/strategy game. But the developers need to take into account the average human lives less than 80 years........this game could do with a little ummmph in its rocket booster system. Yawn :(			",23,6,0,7,14,0,14

												I should show about 7 hours played on this game. 5 of that is solid troubleshooting. Reading through the publisher's forums, it seems I'm not alont. Note, this is for X:Reunion, and not any other expansions. I understand that those work better. What I get are constant crashes. Please judge for yourself however. Take a look at the technical support forums on Egosoft and look at the Steam forums.   Some people get lucky and it works fine, but if it does not, there seems to be no easy fix.

												This game is too much like hard work.I had to resort to a walkthrough just to work out how to complete the first mission after I'd spent an hour flying around space searching in vain for a way to trigger the mission start. If you have the patience to get your head around the obtuse controls, and explore the wide open world without any guidance, then maybe this game will work for you.But for most of us with too many games and too little time, this game requires far too much investment before it starts to pay off - that is presuming it does pay off, I'm just giving it the benefit of the doubt as I didn't get that far!

												So I've been playing for 12 hours and haven't accomplished a noticeable thing. Except for 3-4 story missions.I read the manual, other players tutorials. The normal mode is just bad. Pirates doesn't bail their ships, how could I make a decent amount of credits? Flying and selling stuff(energy cells) in the little cargo bay for dozen hours?? SETA is only 10x faster, game's pace is very slow.The interface is uncomfortable, you can't move windows(monitors) with a mouse for example nor the center on the sector map.Switching to the next enemy works awkward, it marks the farest target instead the nearest one. That's why dogfighting sucks. You need money to equip your ship with good guns and shields, because pirates fly in small fleets, but there is no easy way to get money (except for abandoned ships which I consider as sort of cheating), only tedious trading and ""quests"" with low payments, you have to find an appropriate one though, which takes time.The story.. it's hard to follow if you get distracted and they assume you know most of the game mechanics.It could be easier to play on quickstart instead of normal, but there are newer games, they should be better, why play this?Also, mouse cursor is stuck when steam overlay is enabled.

												If within 12.9 hours of gameplay, I am still nowehere, then there is no point in playing it anymore. Having to read manuals, search for help online, it is just too much work for a whole lot of boring single-player action. So what if I can command a fleet, it's not like there is any point to it. With how much time it takes to even get that far from not knowing anything, would take way too much of my time. The controls are aweful, there is no story, and the gameplay is just boring.My experience:I jump in, I go for story mode. It took a lot of me trying not to give up, to get through the first part. I followed the directions (there is no map to aid you in finding places so I had to pay close attention to the names and do my best), then got into a fight, did okay, then was told to go somewhere else to fight and that's where I got lost. I did manage to find the enemy, but was destroyed in a matter of seconds. What happened? The first enemies were so easy (now I think about it, they may have just been pirates or soemthing, all I know is, they attacked me first), but these next guys? So, I reloaded, this time I tried to find better weapons.... HAHAHAHAHA!!! ??? Good luck, unless you spent hours reading on how to play the game first (something a simple tutorial would have fixed). Overall experience.... a 1 out of 10. It's the future... it's space... it should be charted out and mapped in some way, otherwise... how would you be able to navigate space? Thus, there should have been a map showing you were to go. Instead.. you have to ask for DIRECTIONS! OMG WHAT!? Really? I have to ask some random ship where something is? HAHAHAHA wow that is jut so funny!... alright 2 out of 10 for the comedy. Really people? You have to open comms with some ship to ask if they know where something is and thats only if they have that dialouge available, and sometimes, the directions are aweful and don't lead you to where you want go. So frustrating.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												it had been over 10 years since I last played a game so opaque that I actually shut it off and simply gave up on trying to learn how to play it due to tanking interrest ""if it starts off this bad I don't need to invest in the frustration"". months later I have taken another stab at learning it, watching some guides on youtube. I started by carefully ignoring the fact that the app crashes everytime it was launched in in fullscreen. I went windowed mode. I played long enough to figure out how to stop, start, turn, check my menues, etc. I was becoming interrested... and then the whole things just went and crashed again.""this application has stopped responding"" but it didnt just crash, it crashed with style locking the mouse cursor (which I find unusual in windows 7 especially an application running in windowed mode) so that I had to ctrl+alt+delete and hotkey my way through the windows menus to kill the process. Software testing anyone?the facts speak for themselves I don't feel I need to explicity state what I think of the way the developer has release this game or introduces it to the user.

												TRY IT WHILE IT'S FREE!!!!I wasted an entire day letting my computer download the X series, because I was interested in what I saw. When half of them finished downloading I had to give it a try.Blaring static met my ears on start up, and continued to scratch my eardrums with the obnoxious sound coming from my speakers. I shut down the game and tried another one. Same problem!I did a search for the problem and found mention of editing the Options.ini, to adjust for USB speakers. Yea! I love mucking about in my computer for no reason other than half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥programming. I located the My Games folder but found no folders for the X series at all. I went to steam and used the properties option to go to the game files directly...NO Options.OK, maybe I was in the wrong place. I ran a search on every one of my hard drives for the elusive Options.ini. I found some, but nothing belonging to any of the X series. It was at this point that I realized, if I had paid for this and run into this issue I would be really upset, because I'm this aggravated when I did not pay for it. In short, I do not recommend paying for any of this series, unless you can try it first. You will not be happy to debug someone else's work when you paid to do so. I can not speak to the content of the games, because I never got that far, and I realized I have better things to do with my time. (such as play another game)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Run along and try EVE Online. This takes too much time to figure out the extremely detailed and complex interface. Also, there isn't much tutorials to help you along. But if you're into intergalactic trading and pretty realistic space traavel simulation (like spending 5 whole minutes of travelling from one space gate to the next, without anything to do), then this is for you.

												Fu***ng piece of sh*t game!!eg: the tutorial.Bla bla unimportant intro... (yes I was listening to it), then it says ""Dont forget to activate your back turret"" (not explaining how to do so) so then I have to go inside a 3 layer deep menu structure to read the messages where they hopefully mention how to do it (while the enemies are closing in on your possition...), they dont mention it on the first 2 messages, then I hear a missile lock warning, so I spam ESC to get out of all menus, but ESC also opens an option menu so I get stuck in that instead, by now I have been hit by the first voley of missiles, eventually I get out of the menus, but my ship is so badly damaged so it is burning in the front so all I see is smoke, good luck hitting anything.And this is just the ""tutorial"", now you can imagine the rest of the game.

												Do your home work before you buy!Game released in Nov 2005 and the last patch/update to address general issues was in Dec 2007. Last patch/update to address player concerns was never. The last patch/update to support money grabbing by way of expanding cultural language packages and DLC's was May 7 2013; no reference to game breaking fixes that I can see on Steam. IT appears they abandon this release and went directly to X3: Terran Conflict, a much better X3 game to purchase from this series imo.			",56,3,0,8,6,0,6

												 This game seems unfinished, bugs, crashes and lack of a simple tutorial. Believe I read this was originally made for a x2 expansion, but made into its own x3. I think this game loses alot of good reviews due to this and easy to see why. Graphics are great for their time, but failure to fix crashes such as the infamous targeting crash after how many years is discouraging. Game has so much potential and in depth gaming hours. But you will have to dredge through the learning curve most would not undertake, and read a ton of tips and tutorials from other players on forums who made the journey to get satisfaction from the game.Don't know what the devs were thinking. And fixes for crashes and bugs... Just the main menu screen and 32bit movie clips will max out my gtx660 and raise temperatures to 80c for some reason, while in-game no problem at all.., and does not like multicores i've read. I've had no other problems with games like this game has. Buyer Beware, read up first on this game.			",64,4,5,4,15,0,14

												Ever wonder what it's like to get into the cockpit of a cool space vessel? I did. Then I sat there wondering how to operate the damn thing. There's a learning curve, but it's more like a wall.By the time you figure out the very basic controls, such as how the throttle operates, you'll get blown up. Game Over.So you might think ""I'll just try again"". Nope, because you'll get blown up then too. And again. And again. Game Over. Then you'll hit the 'auto-dock' key and try to do something easy. How hard can it be? Well, you'll slam into the hull because you wern't aligned right, and watch your vessel explode into millions of crappy pixels. Game Over. Frustation. Endless frustration. I don't give up easy, but this is NOT worth it. If this is the future, I'm revert to cave-man living.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												EvE Offline. Except impossible to follow. Was looking for another Freelancer experience and this came up on a lot of searches.  But the gameplay set up is so counter intuitive and less than he as escorting have to go throught the warp gate BEFORE me otherwise they get left in the old system and won't follow.Its a shame, I see how this could be great, but you spend more time ALT+TABBING to figure out controls than actually playing. If you do get it; default command ""J"" is a huge time saver, it basically speeds up time so that when you have to travel across the star system it only takes 2 min, instead of 10 min (I wish I was kidding.) But there is no overdrive or afterburner (to start at least.)			",23,2,0,12,2,0,21

												Holy crap did I really spend 41 hours in this game? The X series is for serious hardcore fans of the genre, and I guess I'm just not. It seemed really tedious and boring, and when you make space combat and exploration boring then something has gone horribly wrong. I think I ended up using some kind of quick and easy way to make money to upgrade my stuff, and even then it made very little difference. Give it a pass unless you're a fan of the previous games in the series.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is probably one of the worst games I have ever played. There is no tutorial whatsover and none of the commands or UI is explained. If, for some reason you figure out where to go in the first hour of gameplay, you better hope you dont crash or die trying to dock at the first space station. You can only save once you have docked at a station, and if you die before then you get to start the whole first hour over.			",23,3,0,8,3,0,5

												First 15min impressions: X3: Reunion.Verdict: What did I just play?I entered this game knowing nothing. and I left it knowing even less. I feel like I just experienced an artifact of another culture, without a knowledge of the language or any context to glean the slightest bit of understanding.The game had something to do with space.Let's recount my adventures:- The game opens with a news report, where the news caster gets quieter and quieter, to the point where I couldn't hear her at all and missed everything she was saying. She mumbles like that for up to 3 minutes.- I go into the settings and find that voice and music are at 80%. Try as I might, I only ever figure out how to increase volume, not decrease it. I leave the options page with voices at 100% and music at 90% and hope everything will be OK.- Some movies play referencing events I have no context for. I gather that I'm a pilot that hates his dad, who is in some sort of coma. I'm asked to show some new pilots the ropes.- I'm dropped in a ship where moving the mouse up moves the view down. I don't see any of the other ships I'm supposed to be leading. Every 30 seconds, a robotic voice tells me ""INCOMING MESSAGE"". There's no way to check messages that I can see.- I read the control config and find out how to move forward, then head to a stargate looking thing. It takes 5 min to reach the gate at top speed. INCOMING MESSAGE- I go through the gate. At a loss for what to do, I click on something, which means fire your guns? I get berated by a man with a Russian accent, who circle strafes me once and blows up my ship. The credits roll.			",258,133,1,31,22,2,26

												My god! This is a blast Scfi, time consuming, beutiful graphics, super detailed, long long , neverending game.And also it is A loong, looong., loooong long game.  And its just one part. There are albion , teran.... and ofcurse X2 universe before.This is massive universe, and you feal it in the game. When you start, you will need hours of teaching yourself how to do what, and after few hours you will forget most of it that you can use.Only after 2-3 days game kicked in. In start you feel so small, irelevant. WHen you start explore, even smaller. But what will you do its all up to you.You can just plot a course and say ok ""This way! Engage!"" and stay on course for days and not reaching the end. The game i massive, and one thing pops in mind, this is more like a simulator, story is some, but lets say that you are creator of the story. Where will you go? With whom will you side? What aproach will you take? Great game/simulator, i cant stres how tih looks on full graphics, on some at least 27"" screen, and one thing that most of them forgot to mention,...... THE SOUND!!!I plugged in my two 250W stand alone towers for most of the games, but in this game sound of ships engines, sound of disrupters, lasers firing, colisons, it freezes you for a moment.

Pirate:if working within the law is not for you the game offeres a wide variety of pitating options, get your self a ship, and kill till your hearts content, then browse the remains for loot, once you are full head to the nearest pirate station to seel your ill gotten gains, what more could a pirate wantBounty Hunter:every faction sells police licences that mean if you kill an enamy of the state in their territory they pay you for it, so once you have one start blasting to get paidto to summerise, what evert you want from your game this game likely has it			",82,4,0,39,10,0,28
