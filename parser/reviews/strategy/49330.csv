												I want to love this game, I really do but this has to be the worst game I've ever played due to a lack of support, bugs, glitches and a very lacking game in general.When I first started this game up I had no idea what to expect never having played a pirate themed game before. The first problem was the voice over's. Terrible. I got into the game and found it rather basic but did enjoy it's subtle charm. I realise that the land missions were a bit dated but honestly the sailing around I had no problem with at all. Once I had the hedgehog (best ship in the game IMO) my enjoyment went up even more. Unfortunately this is the only good thing I'll be saying about this game. When I hit the half way mark I realised some of the achievements were buggy and had not unlocked for things I had gone for. After multiple attempts some of them unlocked. I realise achievements aren't for everyone but if I can grab a couple while I'm playing and enjoying a game I see it as a ""misc quest"" of sorts. Shortly after this issue I came across another. When I opened the menu in game and tried to save my game I would CTD. I played around with it for an hour trying to fix the issue by reloading, going to new areas, etc and nothing worked. I never needed to use the in game load option but that also bugged out and caused a CTD. I discovered during my testing that at least the game auto saved when leaving land so I had an annoying way to at least progress to finish the game. The I came to worst problem I've ever come across in a game ever. The final mission is broken. So badly that even if you get past the first bug or issue there are another 4 waiting for you. I re loaded and tried multiple things multiple times and nothing worked. Oh and this issue, it's been un answered and around since 2011. Everywhere I looked all I found was more people with the same issues and a lucky few, had issues beyond where I was up to in the final mission. All in all I found 5 different common game breaking bugs with the final mission. I cannot get past the second out of the five of them.Overall I wanted to love this game, I forgave its poor design choices on the land maps, I got use to the terrible voice over's and surprisingly I even got use to having to use the auto save feature. The fact that the final mission is that much of a problem for so many people is unacceptable. Especially since nothing has been done about it for so long and the game is still available for purchase. 0/10 ",44,23,0,28,13,0,13

												I like this game! Its very colourful, its not meant to be a historical recreation of pirating & its addictively fun!Your character starts off with a ship, a crew & a pirate base to sail from. The game is mostly quest-driven, the goal being to complete quests for the different factions in the game (there are three), which rewards you with gold & reputation with that respective faction. The ultimate goal is to unite the three factions in order to take on the dreaded Black Cove Pirates & then become the Pirate King. Your character gains experience & reputation along the way, which unlock new skills. Your ship can be upgraded to become ever more powerful & you can recruit a pirate army to help you plunder colonies around the Caribbean. I found that the game mechanics were quite intuitive & its not a game you need to spend hours poring over a manual or practicing detailed tutorials just to play. Sea combat is very easy & basic, but I have found it to be less cumbersome than the mechanics in ""Sid Meier's Pirates! Gold"".  If this game were only about sailing around, fighting other ships & plundering gold from their wreckage, it would be a boring game. But it isn't. Its about questing, accomplishing missions, gaining rewards & experience, & following a storyline. That keeps it interesting & fun & not too serious, enough to hold the player's attention. There are loads of corny pirate jokes to be picked up in bottles floating in the sea so you might even get a laugh out of it. I think the developers have done a lot of work trying to make the game as least serious as possible, to make it a fun game to play rather than a simulation.At the price that its being offered on Steam, in my opinion it is worth the money. Its becoming one of my most enjoyable games to play :)			",26,3,0,6,10,0,20

												Pirates of the Black Cove is game that tries to be many things but it fails in every aspect.The high point of the game is ship fighting but that isnt that great since you can only choose a few special weapons to diversify the combat but it is mostly just firing canons with no boarding to speak of besides the special catapult that you put in your ship to throw men in order to capture ships which isnt very fun to be honest. The ships also sail very slowly which can make traveling in the game world quite painfull only later in the game you get faster ships that becames a little more bearable. The game also forces you to play ground combat to progress the story but there isnt exp or anything like that and the only viable tactic if you can call it that is jut select all units and focus on an single enemy. So most of the times you get ground combat you just wish that ends quickly because it is torture. There is unit variety but you can only have 3 diferent sets of unit per captain and the game doesnt give controls to select diferent groups of units so really your only choice is selecting everyone and defeat a enemy one by one.The story is just bland and the voice acting is quite bad. The game tries to be funny but it is just dry jokes that are delivered by bad voice acting or by pieces of test you find in the game world. There is 3 diferent starting captains that you can choose from but the lines are all the same just perfomed by diferent actors, the characters have diferent background stories in text but in game the story is all the same.Overall the game is just painfull to play, I finished the game but it just felt like torture after awhile, the ship fighting was bearable but the ground combat is just awfull.

												Enjoyable but a pale comparison to Sid Mier's Pirates in my opinion.  I was entertained enough to play it and complete it though.  It has a wiry sense of humor.  The sea battles are enjoyable particularly with the different ordance you earn at different pirate ports but the land battles are a little tedious.  Not overly so but they could have used some refinement.If you enjoy Pirate games, this one is for you.  If not, I would likely skip this one.			",132,20,0,34,17,0,46

												So long as you know what your getting, this game is decent. The story line is simplistic, the dialgue cheesey, and the voice acting comically bad. Gameplay can be a touch repetitive and isn't particularly complicated, but its a fair way to spend a few hours playing pirate without having to commit to an exceptionally in depth game.Fun, simple, and pretty easy. Not sure I would pay full price for it, but if you pick it up on sale I doubt you will regret it.			",29,3,0,17,7,0,14

												I'd really like to love this game, i almost do, but it's got so many flaws it's hard not to condemn it to hell and back.First impressions are awesome! It looks great, sounds great except for the worst Voice Over in the history of videogames.But.... It is so so so slooooow. Sailing is slow but it's pretty and things to do, and upgrades and new ships help. But sailing from west to east every damn mission sucks. Land missions, thats the worst part. No AI at all it seems, if it's there it's very random but with a slight tendancy to be forgetful and dumb. The walking on land is even slower, and the Health regen is rediculous. Combat is way to flawed and should be what combat straight out of an Alpha build might look like.No minimap sucks. Quest rewards would be nice to see. So many important things are not explained in any way. Give me some numbers or hints on what stuff does!But the game has so many good features, like base upgrades and stats and NPCs that can join, ship upgrades and special items. But nothing feels finished.I'm sorry to let this one go, i can not recommend it i'm afraid.			",752,262,30,159,98,4,190

												As you start a campaign the first thing to smack you in the face is the horrific voice acting. If you choose Walker de Planc (side note, expect several puns of dad-quality throughout), you will get an immediate front-row seat to just how little the developers cared about who they hired to voice act. To his credit, I could tell he was trying to pull off an Irish accent. He's immediately joined by a forgettable side character that also made me want to pull my hair out. I barely made it out of the first ten minutes of gameplay.With that out of the way, the rest of the game is actually pretty well done for what it is. PoBC is a silly little arcade game that never attempts to take itself seriously, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. Sea navigation/battles are compelling, though weather and day/night cycles are sorely missed. Land navigation/battles are unremarkable, but passable. A.I. leaves something to be desired, especially when one or two of your men somehow manage to get stuck behind a pillar, resulting in their death in the event of a retreat. The story is only as good as the voice actors sell it, so as things go, it's not great.It's a below average game, but it's definitely a fun way to pass a few nights playing. Well worth the $2.49 I paid for it on a Steam sale.			",55,15,1,3,2,0,9

												Eh. Not bad. Just played through the tutorial missions (an hour or two). Feels a lot like Sid Meier's Pirates, but a bit less... I dunno. Just a bit less. Almost feels like this was what somebody on Sid's team wanted to do with that game, but split off and did their own thing instead.The big differences aa that there's no ""battle map,"" (when you meet another ship, you just start shooting, you don't run into it and then get whisked away to the enconter grid) and you actually have to walk around town to do things, as opposed to just clicking around town to access the buildings. When you meet a ship on the ocean, you just start shooting.If you've never played Sid Meier's Pirates, I recommend this game. If you HAVE played Sid's game, and wish it was just a little bit different, give this a try. Overall I'm disappointed that it's so much like SMP, but it's not a bad game; it's juts not worth playing this AND Pirates.			",168,33,0,50,30,4,67

												This is a fairly decent game which is pretty cheap (though the DLC seems rather over-priced) but it's provided several hours of reasonably entertaining gameplay.Good points:Decent graphics, simple gameplay - not much thinking or brainpower/strategy needed, some humourBad points:The pirate jokes - they're f***ing awful, a bit of laziness by the game designers by duplicating some of the town maps for different locations, pathfinding of units is sometimes a bit off, could've had a bit more depth of gameplay.Unlike some of the reviews, I had no problems with the stability of the game, though I did encounter a few minor glitches in the game.I bought the game in a sale, and while I'm not sure if the game would be great value at full price, I enjoyed playing it.  Give it a go, but don't expect a top-notch title. ",340,98,6,49,30,2,64

												Ever since Sid Meyers Pirates I have been waiting for the next great pirate game.  This is not it.  No fleets, no crews, no trading.  What you get is a very simplified but fun game.  You get to blow ships up, run missions, and raid towns.  The game is straight forward and short enough that the limited game play is ok.  You are probably looking at 10+ hours to complete the game depending on how much ""extra"" fighting you do.  During the game I only ever bought 1 extra ship.  I bought soldiers for the land missions. Never really lost either.  Upgraded both my boats with extras.  I don't see much replayability in the game, and you cannot continue after completing the last mission.Get it at a sale price with the knowlegde that you will play it for a couple of days.

I like that the game is pretty easy - it's one of those games that just SHOULD be a bit o' laid back fun.It's colourful, light entertainment - if you like pirates, I'd recommend this game.YARR!

												I've played 3 hours of this game. I loved the original Pirates! game from the 1990's and its remakes, so I thought I'd give this game a try. It sucks. One big drawback is the land based motion. Characters seemingly take forever to get from A to B. After a few hours of this, I'd had enough waiting for my character to move around. There's also no wind effects, so ""sailing"" your ship is really driving your ship using either fast speed or slow speed. The dialog is clunky, I eventually worked out you could left click the inane banter bubble to speed things along. You can only take over enemy ships by selecting one particular talent where you catapult sailors at the enemy ship, who then try to take it over. Otherwise, any prize ship you may defeat will simply be sunk in battle. All in all, this games bears little semblance to anything nautical. Save your money, wait for another Pirates! remake.

												A decent piratey adventure game. On paper it's good: you get to upgrade your ship to pillage other ships, and you get to land on islands and pillage them with a bunch of your crew. It's arcadey enough to be fun to play and not like those other pirate simulators where you have to resource manage everything down to acquiring enough shoelaces for your crew before you set off to trade some more goats for cumen.Unfortunately the ship to ship combat becomes tedious after a few hours, and the controls in the land battles are so bad that the later battles become almost impossible.

												I really enjoy this game.  It's a casual sail around, blow up enemy ships, collect some coin, visit faction leaders, do fairly linear missions for them, gain party members, visit settlements and kill enemy pirates on land, blow up the banks, walk around (A LOT) and then head back to the ship and repeat...  A bit of a grinder but it's very good looking and the music is nice.  Not a ton of ships or EQ but it's worth a few bucks.  I wish it had controller support so I could lay on the couch and play in big picture mode but it's fine with mouse and keyboard.  Not sure why people may say ""garbage"" and ""avoid"" and the like - they must have had some strange expectations for a $10 game that you can generally get for less than $5.			",88,7,0,12,8,1,8

												Purchased this game hoping for a modern and improved experience similar to that of 'Sid Meier's - Pirates'.  Like other negative review comments for 'Pirates of Black Cove' I wanted to like this game. However the overall game, especially the gameplay (e.g. ship-to-ship battles) itself, feels 'sluggish'.Whilst I did not experience any performance problems (note: make sure you switch the game to use your dedicated GFX card if you have an Optimus laptop!), it seems to me a lot of effort went into graphical improvements, without any of these improvements contributing anything beneficial the overall gameplay experience = waste of computer resources.I believe any further develpoment of this game will NOT have any benefit, as it's 'core' gameplay has been taken in a complete 'dull' direction.If like me you enjoyed 'Sid Meier's - Pirates', stick with that classic and avoid 'Pirate of Black Cove'.

												This game is cool, nice set up in pirate times, but it needs a lot of work and improvementes when you actually get on land in order to complete the missions. Unit control is pretty bad. There is no formation choice whatsoever.			",218,64,11,25,35,4,57

												This looks and behaves like a game made a decade ago, on the cheap, with writing and dialogue attempting cheesy humour, but missing totally on the humour bit. Expect crashes, a horrible interface, and no redeeming qualities whatsoever.			",157,21,1,28,39,1,41

												I liked this game for a while despite the lag in parts of the game and the somewhat awkward steering of the ship. In the end I stopped playing the game because it became repetitive.			",5,4,0,1,0,0,1

												Only about 30-45 minutes into the game so far - but I'm a huge fan of it from the beginning. My only issue is with the voice work - it leaves little to be desired, and trivial (unimportant) words between the subtitles and the actual voices are different. This isn't anything new - but it's something that throws me off sometimes.I'd recommend the game to anyone that enjoys pirates or the Sid Meier's Pirates! games.			",210,29,3,32,29,1,26

												I liked the game(all 12 hours in my gameplay) until the kraken fight. It is so badly scripted and the AI cheats so much that i couldn't convince myself to continue and uninstalled the game immediately.Sorry Paradox..you could have made a gem out of it but that kraken really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off.

												From a player who loved the warcraft 3 map Battleships, Neverwinter Nights, and strategy games, I thought it would be love in first sight.Sadly instead it turned out to be on of the wrost aquisitions of my life, one that I'm constantly comparing to other poor aquisitions over the last few years, and Pirates is still on the top of the list.
