												you know how youre playing steel ocean and World of warships thinking wow, this is some really cool stuff. How did they think to do all of this? This is the game that came up with those concepts. Except you had to actually know what you were doing. Want to be a submarine and blow stuff up undetected? Go for it. oh and when I say, undetected, I mean, undetected, no crappy little green blob of where you are under the water (I mean why the hell would you do that?) Want to play as an aircraft carrier launch your plane then take direct control and fly it around shooting down other planes or perhaps launch a torpedo at an enemy ship with the plane? Go for it.Or do you prefer going as a destroyer and being the only one able to detect submerged subs at a safe enough distance?Maybe you prefer the RTS view and just to tell them where to go from a top down perspective?This game absolutely killed a year of my life when I was 19 when I had it on the 360. Greatest game in its genre, hell, havent seen a real clone of it since.Dont care if this never gets read, this had to be written.I guarantee if you like those little world of warship games, this game is going to break them for you.Why cant I click the recommend button more than once?

												People often complain about Windows Live, and the game not launching. In order to get around this, just download the client for windows live. You don't even have to use it. It's not obstructive at all. When you launch the game, create a LOCAL PROFILE. There is no account making required and it saves your game. My game works 100% fine on Windows 8. I have had no issues.The game itself is perfect. The campaigns can be slightly repetitive... but I spend 90% of my time on the Island Capture. It's a stregetic Civilization V type domination mode. I reccomend for anyone who likes WW2 ship combat with the perfect mix of strategy in there too. The aircraft combat/ movements are simplified, but it is not that much of a problem. I've found I can still enjoy it perfectly. It fits just fine; the ship combat is the main focus. Love this game, would reccomend to anyone!In your settings, turn off the voice and music volume for a flawless experience- the battle announcer in skirmish mode can get annoying.			",57,3,0,7,15,0,1

												There's really not much to say, I've owned this game before but not in Steam. Let's start with a few things people usually ask me about this game, assuming people already know the mechanics of this game.Is it a good WWII naval warfare game? Not extremely good, it's enjoyable. There is a distinct difference between the two campaign and each campaign can take a pretty lengthy time to finish. Nothing feels that much repetitive except maybe shooting down a seemingly infinite amount of incoming planes in certain missions.Is it realistic? No, back then when it was first released it was marketed as an 'authentic' experience, doesn't mean it's realistic but you do get the feeling that you are in control of a giant battleship, an intimidating bomber, a sleek fighter, and all the other units in the game. It's personally just a pet peeve of mine but real naval battles of world war 2 would take hours to days to finish, with ships exchanging shells from tens of kilometers away. In this game, 3 kilometers is apparently too far for a 460 mm cannonDoes it age well? No and yes, the lack of support for this game makes it impossible to do online multiplayer, however you can expand your singleplayer experience with various mods. It's a shame because the multiplayer component was a damn great fun. And yes, the game can still look pretty beautiful at certain lighting angles, not much to say because at least 90% of the landscape is water, nothing particularly special.Is it 'fun'? Depends, some missions can be pretty harsh at times and require fast reflexes to effectively give commands and switch between your available units in higher difficulties. They are not incredibly frustating and you never feel cheated by the AI. But those lucky AI shots that crippled my engine, blew up my ammo storage, and set my deck on fire? They are pretty annoying, yeah, but all is fair, because my torpedo bomber blew up a hole in their hull big enough for water to flood in and make the ship list so bad that she can't use her cannons.Should you buy it? Yes and no, if you are desperate for some naval warfare action where you are in control of the units instead of just a strategy game where you watch ships blow each other up, sure. Otherwise no, unless it's on sale ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Extremely fun naval warfare, fairly well done campaigns that lets you play as both Allied forces and IJN, as well as a good variety of Skirmish maps and modes.Island capture mode can keep you busy and having fun for hours, with a huge variety of units and tactics available-  you can build up a sizeabe fleet and wrest control of Islands by way of LST's and Cargo ships, or parachuting units in by air. The naval battles themselves are intense with visual damage and listing to ships that have suffered heavy barrages, and some of that damage remains even after repairing which adds a nice touch of immersion.Whereas Duel, Escort and Siege modes are more to the point fixed objective modes that have a nice degree of variety to them, including outright 4v4 Battleship duels, destroying an anchored fleet in a Ohka suicide rocket, various naval and air escort missions, The overall amount of freedom you get in Island Capture mode allows you to sort of make your own scenarios as well, such as spawning a ton of Cargo and LST ships and a small destroyer escort and try to make it all the way across to the other side of the map against a Veteran AI - guaranteed fun.If you like the naval warfare in Battlefield 1942 - especially on Midway Island, then its a sure bet you will like this game, only the naval battles and air battles are much larger in scope and scale. There really is no other game in the world like Pacific or Midway, just like there is no other game in the world like Battlefield 1942 with its true actual naval air and land warfare, so its a unique game in that respect.Furthermore there is a dedicated and passionate modding community, that despite zero officially released mod tools or support, has managed to create a few dozen mods of all types, extra command points, retextures, realism mods, overhauls, etc. And they are still working on newer versions, it has one of the most dedicated yet small modding communities you will ever encounter. Now onto the really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ part - the developers are no more and all of the three DLC's they made were only available on Games for Windows Live, which is also dead now. On one hand we can rejoice that GFWL is dead, yet on the other, the geniuses at Eidos/Squeenix decided to only give GFWL PC Marketplace the DLC's (two map packs and one unit pack with 3 units- including the Montana Class Battleship). So now that GFWL is dead and the developers have also been axed, there is no way to purchase or otherwise obtain these additional maps and units, which is a serious error on Squeenix's part.I don't know why the DLC's aren't available on Steam yet even though the game is, I would at this point happily pay to buy all three of them even though the developers and the IP are now gone because the Battlestations franchise does not deserve the fate its been given, its incredibly frustrating to want and purchase content for a game that should have been there anyways and yet to find now that its no longer available. It would be really nice if Steam somehow acquired those DLC's and brought them back for sale.			",103,7,1,5,14,0,30

												Following up on Battlestations: Midway, Battlestations: Pacific keeps the same mix of RTS and action together. This time the game has 2 campaigns, one for the Japanese and one for the US putting you right in the middle of large naval battles in the Pacific. Gameplay is the same giving you a large tactical view of all of your units and allows you once again to take command of any unit at anytime to let you control the action first hand.

												A huge improvement from Midway. Midway was a great game but it didn't have a high replayability. You could go through the campaign a few times and collect achievements or spend some time on the multiplayer but it felt pretty sparse in options. It may have been because I played Midway on the Xbox, but after about 70 or so total hours of playing it got fairly boring. Along comes Pacific and ups the ante. You now have the option to play through the Japanese perspectives of the Pacific campaign, alongside the Americans, a skirmish mode with quite a few game types, and more multiplayer options (unfortunately multiplayer is dead for Midway due to the Gamespy servers closing however people are still able to play Pacific online). The addition of new units, a special unit unlock system, and new nose art are also worthy mentions. I will also note that you may encounter issues with Games for Windows Live. In order to play Pacific you need to have a Microsoft account. You may have problems activating your code, signing in or even starting the game.  Overall in the time I've played, its a great game. I'd highly recommend it to any history buff or anyone who wants to try something new that has a little dab of strategy alongside action. For the current price, I don't see why you wouldn't buy it. I would consider playing Midway first, it will help you get acquainted with the story if you aren't familiar with the Pacific campaign during World War 2, you'll enter Pacific hopefully looking for more, and its like 7 bucks so why not?

												This naval warfare game has an interest mix between real-time strategy and action, allowing you to command a fleet of ships from the tactical map and be able to take direct control of individual ships and planes. I usually play RTS games and action games and I am also interested in naval combat as well so this game fits me pretty well. The game looks great and sounds great as well. Every ship and plane model is very detailed and every ship that is capable of firing artillery sounds powerful, especially the Iowa-class battleship. The music lively and bombastic, it reminds me a bit of the music from Silent Hunter 4. Some people say the voice acting is horrible but I'm not bothered by it. It's not the worst voice acting I've heard but it's not the best I've heard either. There are some missions that are slower than others, only allowing you control specific units until certain objectives are completed during a mission but there are other missions that allow you to control any unit given to you. Some campaign missions can be 30 minutes or up to an hour long, depending on the player's playstyle. Plus, unlockable ships and planes can be obtained from completing hidden objectives in campaign missions. These unlocks can be used in any mission that will allow it and they can be used in missions you've already played, which makes for great replay value. Powerful ships like the Iowa-class battleship and planes like the TBM Avenger which can launch powerful anti-ship rockets can make missions you've played before a bit easier and more fun.Overall, it's a fun game to play. I got it for a much lower price than it was first released. It's about $10 so I think it's quite a bargain.			",15,0,0,1,2,0,2

												For what it's worth, it's a decent game.But beyond decent I cannot say more about it. The storyline of course following American and Japanese confrontations in WW2 does the old black and white cinematic whenever explaining stories. The campaigns are decent but can be found repetitive after a while. The ability to switch between boat and plane though is greatly appreciated, as it was one of the main reasons why I bought this game. I like to support games that give more options and more control (especially first/third person control) over any unit that belongs to you on the map. There exists abilities to change what types of weapons you use, from machine guns to bombs. During spawn, players are able to choose what type of bomb they wish to carry (on certain air crafts of course). Boats also have the abilities to launch torpedos, artillery, and of course their choice of machine guns.  The handling of both boats and planes are quite decent. At first they feel slightly awkward due to the camera possibilities (and the ability to hold RB on an xbox controller to check where you've dropped your bomb - or hold RT after dropping the bomb to see where it goes). What is good though is you are able to do your bombing run and the game gives you feedback (on your target sights) whether you hit the target or not. If the player presses select, they are able to bring up a big map and are able to issue orders to local squadrons and instruct them where to go or attack. Certain maps you are able to choose to be an airplane or a boat. The auto firing is okay at times but it is sort of annoying not being able to fire things all at once on your own. The need for auto firing seems reasonable, however I would of liked ot see a better key or controller layout to fire what you want to fire. Visually the game is decent (xbox 360 quality - or toys soldiers sort of graphics). Graphics do not pose a problem.I've had a few crash issues where the game just shuts down, not exactly sure why I'll try to follow-up with an edit in the future. I would recommend this game if it appeals to you, but there isn't much else than what you see on the videos. The game types from siege to assault are good, but again they all sort of feel the same. I wish you could land on carriers or were given a bit more planes and boats to start with instead of playing a long campaign (with some difficult challenges may I add). Even though recommended, I feel the true score here is RATING : 6.85/10.Gameplay C+ Story / Campaign B- Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music B- Replay-ability C+ Overall  C+ ",195,9,17,10,23,2,18

												I love the graphics and feel of Battlestations: Pacific. It cuts out all the realistic difficulties of controlling airplanes and ships and gets straight to the thrill of torpedoing hulking battleships and bombing beach heads.The flow of carrier combat, however, is ruined by adhering to regenerating ammo. Instead of attacking, returning, refueling, attacking the flow is attacking, flying in a circle until shot down, respawn, attacking. This was a high point of Battlestations: Midway so it really bugged me that it changed.I played this in 2012 and completed the main storyline modes. I was not able to play multiplayer.

												I have never reviewed a game on here, but I must for this classic. Both this game and ""Midway"" are fantastic. They give you a sense of reality, and when you finished the Japanese campaign you'll get an almost scary sense of what truly almost happened if maybe one of these real-life battles had gone the other way!The game can be frustrating at times on the hardest level of difficulty, but I guess that's what ""hardest"" means. I loved every aspect, from dog fighting in the early, slower planes to torpedoing carriers to blasting things apart in a battleship to even using land-based guns to blow planes out of the sky! Every aspect of combat was enjoyable in this game.Even the mission briefings were well done. Showing actual footage was a great touch. Some things might be slightly unrealistic, but there are always sacrifices that need to be made for playability so I don't mind them at all.People complain about Windows Live, but the work-around is so easy I think all the negative reviews here because of it are not warranted, which is why I am writing my OVERWHELEMINGLY POSITIVE review here!

												The game DOES work in windows ten if you bother to take the effort to find out how to make it work. Download this http://www.xbox.com/en-GB/Live/PC/DownloadClient and log in. Lan will work fine. However if you need to use hamachi for lan or tungle, Then head to this next link. http://segmentnext.com/2010/08/26/battlestations-pacific-hamachi-tunngle-guide/ Worked fine for me and 3 friends bought and played it today on windows 10. DONT GIVE UP HOPE! IT DOES WORK!!!!Great game i must add :) I imagine if the Battlestations Midway has the same problem then there will be a similar fix.			",78,5,2,1,16,2,8

												I won't refund the game because I bought it for $2. It just simply doesn't work without GFWL anymore, and it's such a fun game, but unplayable since GFWL got shuttered. I'll let them keep that $2 in hopes someone somewhere comes out with a solution of Steam goes and fixes it. Hopefully.			",33,1,0,2,8,0,4

I tried the whole GFWL and updates, those are a bust. The game loads up to the ""Menu"" with NOTHING ON IT, then after a while it goes to a great cut scene, then right back to the BLANK MENU screen, i cant even exit it without killing the process........WTF ",151,13,4,41,24,0,34

												Be sure to read the Guide to getting Battlestation Pacific to run on your computer before you purchase.  Apparently some have fixed the Widnows LIVE problem without too much headache, but some unfortunate souls will never get the game to run.  I did the first three ""fixes"" to no avail, and I'm not willing to make the lengthy involved changes to open my computer up so this one game will run.  If you're fortunate this will run for you; if not be prepared to go the full route with your computer changes, and even then it may not work.  This game will stay on my bench forever.  Too bad.

												I brought these Battlestations Pacific and Midway, because it was interesting Game. But after purchasing them, I was disgusted that they do not work with Windows 10. And also having to download a non-exist Windows Live BS....and still nothing worked. This is damn disgusting, that Steam sells Games, which does not work on Windows 10 or also selling Games with a Windows Live which does not exist anymore. I asked for Refund, and got refused. This game is only for those who cannot afford a up-to-date PC or Laptop. Steam should start organizing the Game selling, and stop selling games which will not work, and etc.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a fantastic strategy/semi rp ship game. The use of submarines, along with the actual battles and detail of actual aircraft and ships make this game great. The Japanese campaign is far better in my opinion, since it allows you to attack Pearl Harbor on the opening mission as well as use mini subs, kaiten subs (which were suicide torpedoes), and kamikaze attack aircraft. Here's the downside, the dialogue and voice acting is terrible (basically they state the obvious constantly, ""sir, the ship's sinking"", ""sir, we got em"", ""they're headed to the bottom"", just play with the voice off, otherwise you're going to listen to 1950s characters talking...gee wiz, golly gee etc)7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of my fave Xbox games, so was keen to play it again on PC.  I was worried reading all the problems other people have had getting it to run - but on sale at less at £2 it was worth a punt.  No trouble running under Windows 7, and the Windows Live wasn't a problem, created a local profile and bang, back in full WWII Pacific Combat.  Nothing quite like opening up with all the big guns on your battleship and mincing the opposition.  Happy nerd!			",39,8,0,4,21,0,11

												This works with windows ten, Only you need to have downloaded Windows live and set it to be compatible with windows 7, then have windows live account update, and restart the game and launch again, register the key and you can play! Its lengthy process but totally worth it! Game is awsome and facinating Mulitplayer works aswell with friends inviting each other through the windows live ingame, so make sure you add your friends names, so they can invite you or vise versa, Other then that, this game is brilliant for as old as it may seem, this has it all! Command and Control a fleet of ships and armada of bombers, this game doesnt disappoint, it was what was out before warthunder and world of warships, keep in mind this game is old when you play it and still very much fun so are the cut scenes and music and clips, voice overs, game is one of its kind, Perfect ww2 game USA vs Japan			",59,4,1,9,11,0,24

												Battlestations Pacific is a WW2 RTS/Third person shooter type game. You take control of a ship or plane and take the fight right to the enemy. You can take control of a PT Boat and fight off air planes, or take control of the legendary USS Enterprise and launch planes to attack your enemy. With the map, you can take control of planes or ships and tell them to move or attack. At that point, you can forget about them and continue with other things. You have two campaigns with the Japanese or USA. There are tutorials, but they don't tell you really how to play. You get four different tutorials, two for each nation. Two for planes for both sides, two for their ships. After that AND the campaign, there are skirmishs and such. There is also Multiplayer, so you can play with your friends.+Great gameplay+You can play it as a RTS as well.+Use some of history's most legendary ships, such as the USS Enterprise and even the Yamato for a section.+Multiplayer function, with a variety of different modes.+Decendly long campaign that kept me in it for over 12 hours.+Is decendly cheap, and its prequal, Battlesations Midway, is also great in its own right.-Requires Games for Windows Live.All in all, I give this game a 9/10. A great game that if you don't have it in your library, you either hate WW2 games, or your ignorant of great games. ",76,11,0,20,37,0,38

SCG -  Windows 10 fix for GFWL (2016) 
A Guide for Lost Planet 2
By: SplitCoreGaming

			So to begin. I tried all old fixes and they simply do not apply to Windows 10. Windows 10 actualy has its own fixes for GFWL, except one, The Bloody Firewall permissions!		


or i have copied the steps here in case it gets cut out:**So here are my steps:•Install Lost Planet 2 - It will crash on launch. Good! Let it have it's moment...•Go to http://www.xbox.com/en-gb/Live/PC/DownloadClient and install as Admin. DO NOT TOUCH COMPATIBILITY SETTINGS•Once installed go to C:\Windows\SysWOW64and type 'xlive' into search box at top right.•Select all files shown and Copy them to C:\Windows\System32•Restart PC•This is the step I beleive messing most people up Go to your firewall settings and manualy add 'GFWLive.exe' and 'GFWLClient.exe' from the C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Games for Windows - LIVE\Client•Now bootup Lost Planet 2. Should load fine, signin in, follow instructions to update and restart, recover profile and enjoy.Hope this helps others.**p.s:  If u wanna play some online i'm game			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Graphics look good with everything maxed out at 1080p. Sounds good too in surround. Used KBM with no issues and also tried it with my Xbox 360 controller. Works great.

Also this game can modded I really like it.But this game had some problems such as Can't plays in Windows 8 or 10 but can play well in Windows XP, Vista and 7.

Sure World of Warships' got nicer graphics and such (I play that game as well and I'm having lots of fun too) but comparing it to Battlestation Pacific? Battlestation Pacific has more modes to play from campaign to standard game (skirmish). Well at least it can keep you busy for longer period of time.----------------------------------------------------There are two sides to play, Japanese and US, that's it unlike World of Warhips (Japan, US, German, Soviet, etc.). But they offer campaign for both of them so you know you'll be busy for a long time. Lots of ships and planes, and you can control both of them so you can control your fleet better (plus more fun).

I have an Ultrawide monitor and despite trying to change video settings, the game would save the settings and made the UI unusable. There's also zero audio, despite headache inducing troubleshooting.

												I may not have much time logged on the steam version, but when this first came out on the Xbox 360, I played the HELL out of it. I loved how it played. The ships looked awesome and felt powerful. The planes looked awesome and performed like they should. But above all, you could be anything. A submarine? A plane? A flotilla of ships? All yours to command. It even had a light RTS element for those who like to sit an watch. This game had everything for a history buff like me, at least until the disc gathered an ungodly amount of scratches. All these years later, I decided to get the version on steam and relive a bit of my childhood, only to dicover you have to jump through a few hoops to get it running (seriously, WHY is the now defunct Games for Windows Live necessary to run this game?!?). Once I did get it running, I discovered time had not been kind to it. The graphics (especially on the ships) were very muddy and lacked detail. Battles became tedious with how long they took and how slowly the ships moved. The naval cannons (especially on the Yamato) lacked punch and was brought down with poor sound design. There is also a lack of ships in general, featuring mainly the Americans and the Japanese, with only a handfull of ship types within them as well. The voice acting is BAD and the missions, the Japanese ones (intentionally) being the most outstanding, aren't very historically accurate. The planes have a wonky control scheme with no way to invert the controls, that I've found. In short, it wasn't what I remember it being. I will grant you that this game and it's predecessor are very unique and have yet to be emulated, but when compared to other similar games, like Wargaming's World of Warships, it just doesn't hold up (tech-wise, at least. Wargaming's increasingly expensive free-to-play model and some of the players themselves are a different story entirely). Unless you're a very nostagic person like myself, I personally cannot recommend this game to anyone else. If you want a fix of naval combat, I cautiously recommend World of Warships if you enjoy MMOs, but as already mentioned, it isn't without it's share of problems. Good luck and fair seas, Captains!

												Really fun game and has a lot of replay value. The graphics are great, the game makes you feel like you're actually in battle and it does take some careful planning. In CTI mode, I wish you could assign more AI to each team to make things more interesting, but there's only 1 enemy AI.However, I cannot recomment this game. I could not get it working, due to Microsoft shutting down Games for Windows Live, which prevents this game from even starting properly. I have searched and experimented for hours to get it to work, but no luck. If they would've fixed the issue, I'd give it 100% yes, but the state the game is in right now, it's a no.Don't buy it.

												Played this game back on the 360, there is a bug where the game crashes, all you have to do is download windows live and install it separately, I must say the voice acting is not good, but it is nice they give a contect of what is happening, you they give you the ability to fly planes, sail ships or subs. Its nice that they allow you to modify the AI's priority a bit. Setting up ships in an effective screen for your carrier does make a difference. It also has a decent multiplayer. And kamikaze planes, too few games have them. While the voice acting is horrible, the sound track is damned good, and if you are really in the game, it immerses you in the game more.

												All welcome.Before starting my review,I want to say that the game Battlestations pacific was a great game until recently.From this moment I will say more.And so begin.This review I will divide into two parts 1-how the game was before I left her in the summer of 2016, and 2-how the game has become when I return in February 2017. I want to say that this game was purchased by me one of the first to steam,well, it is not surprising that one of my favorite.Perhaps I'll just cut to the pluses of this game before I left. You ask why I left?Answer:It I'm just tired,although I spent a pretty big amount of time.1.This game was the first in th plan,the opportunity to manage both the ship and submarine and aircraft. I pay more attention to control of the ship,for me it was just fine,class battleships I was surprised that I could play it for hours.2.Decent graphics for games 2009.3.Good gameplay.4.Good models of ships submarines and aircraft.5.Beautiful portrayal of water and terrain,even the weather,which gives the atmosphere,there is also destructible ships,which is very great.Of the minuses I note that the game is heavily arcade,and modes that are designed for multiplayer much dull,and in multiplayer no one plays.Now, on to the saddest part of the review.Here I will present just one huge drawback,the game just doesn't work,just won't start,black screen and all.Of course there are those who will say that I'm stupid,and everything works fine,but it's not.The game won't start even without mods,on PC I haven't changed,so one conclusion,the game just died,but I hope that everything will return as it was before.My review is mixed.For working games I would be a 8/10 rating.For inoperative 0/10.Battlestations pacific 2009-2017.Remember,love,mourn.(((			",52,2,4,6,7,0,7

												The game is a blend of RTS, flight and naval action games. Like most games that try to blend well defined genres, Battlestations: Pacific does not exactly shine in any of these.The RTS component is slow and is presented in such a way as to make combat situations difficult. Watch as your ships inch their way toward the enemy fleet, having nothing but the cannon fire of the selected ship letting you know that the ships are, in fact, shooting back at the enemy. Bite your nails in anticipation as torpedoes casually plough through the water like they're on Sunday stroll in Torpedo Paradise. Whoop in joy as the torpedo connects with the front of the enemy ship, then catch your face as it falls as the torpedo continues on its merry way, and you realize that the ships are apparently smaller than what the RTS models show. Pull your hair out in frustration as you try to find or quickly swap to a specific unit in your vast army. Panic as the folorn cry of one of the many similar sounding airman alerts you that he is under attack. Seriously. Except for a red arrow and that alert, there's no way to know if one of your units has started combat, if that unit is not currently selected. Apparently, war is silent except for the unit whose model the commander is looking at back in the war room.Planes slam into each other with annoying frequency, even when on their way to their destinations as squadron pilots fail to think in 3D. Five PT boats could lay out a massive volley of torpedoes that is fully capable of blowing a battleship up. Seriously, if shooting a minigun is like God taking a fistful of bullets and throwing them at your enemy, then a few PT boats is like the minigun that shoots torpedoes.So why the thunbs up? Well, if you bear in mind that it is neither a simulator nor an RTS game, Battlestations: Pacific bears up rather well. The campaign feels great, with tense moments and moments that makes you wish you had friends so they could see that one awesome moment that is now gone forever. Both sides of the campaign are just that - both sides - not 'that other campaign all over again but with different colors'.But people play these games not for the campaign, so let's talk about the skirmishes (multiplayer, for those of you freaks who actually have friends). Points are shared between players on the same team, so not only is a match less hectic, it allows for the army to operate as one, rather than relying on the AI to control every other unit for you. Battles go back and forth as the ball passes from one team to the other, yet do not lead to stalemates and hours-long matches. The AI itself is at least competent at carrying out most tasks.At the end of the day, there are better RTS games; there are better air combat games. There might be better naval combat games - those are so hard to come by. But if it's a mix of those genres that you are after, Battlestations: Pacific is worth getting on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Although this game is not for everyone, it is my favorite strategy game. Being able to independently control a individual unit and have a major battle is epic. The variety of units in the game is also a great bonus and the different abilities to destroy a single unit makes the game fun. Some of the major problems in the are the occasional glitches with the ships, and the inability to shot paratroopers out of the air			",904,197,17,59,57,3,87

												Heyyo, The way the combat works on air/sea/submarines is perfect I say. It's got challenge, it's got great graphics, good AI and the gameplay will put a smile on your face as you totally demolish enemies and watch their ships slowly crumple. It also has many of the super battleships that were famous during World War 2 so that always makes a fun challenge. This is what I hope Wargaming's World of Warplanes and World of Warships gameplay will be like.			",466,98,12,57,64,6,85

												As the sequel to Battlestations Midway, Eidos did a very good job in creating a strategy/action game that follows up on its predecessor and spans the major battles of WWII in the Pacific theater. Not a simulator or serious RTS game by any means but just complex enough to give it a quasi-simulator feel. The campaigns for the US and Imperial Japanese are well detailed and fun and would be awesome if it wasn't for the cringe worthy voice acting. For a historical war game this is one of the better ones I've seen in a while.			",16,3,2,6,21,0,21

												Combining elements of ship/sub warfare, arcade flight simulator and real time tactics.  The single player missions range from a mini-sub attack on Sydney Harbour, through to full fleet invasions involving multiple aircraft carriers and associated battlegroups.  There is slightly more emphasis on flight compared to the previous title.  There are some artefacts that creep in to illustrate that this is a console port, the ship guns now autocompute range and lead, but this is offset by the ships now having subtargets (fuel, engine, magazne, etc) that you can aim for.  The control scheme isn't as good as the previous native title, but it is passable.  The only really annoying oversight is that there is no way to assign aircraft rudder to the twist action of a joystick.  There are some interesting new units, the kaiten torpedo (plays like a manually guided torp), the LSM(R), Ohka (kamikazi rocket bomb).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Battlestations Pacific is an amazingly fun game for it's age, ripe with awesome ship battles, air to air combat, and a fun campaign that is challenging and will keep you on your toes.I can't comment on multiplayer, but the singleplayer portion is both fun and exciting, and will keep you coming back to see what you can take before cracking. Whether you're fighting in air to air combat, air to sea, sea to sea, sea to air, or commanding your fleet. This game will almost always keep you coming back for more.However, on the multiplayer note, it uses Microsoft Live, which is in it's own a huge mess. But if it's anything like single-player but with other people, I'm sure it would be amazing too.I highly recommend it if you enjoy WW2 games, strategy games, or dogfighting games.There's also submarines.That's fun, too.

I cant recommend this game for anyone due to being unable to play due to the developers not taking that requirement out... I cant say I will ever buy another game from this developer... BTW the developer was aquired by the publisher and is no longer in business... Publisher needs to update the game...			",10,0,0,4,36,1,51

												Sequel to Battlestations: Midway, this game improved on almost everything from its predecessor.Like in Midway, Battlestations Pacific is an action game that puts you in command of either a fighter/bomber plane, a destroyer ship, submarine, pt boat and control an aircraft carrier in Real-Time Strategy style. Contrary to Midway, I had lots of fun with this game! Graphics, controls, sounds and especially, the gameplay were all worked upon and for once, I played a great sequel! Pacific offers you two campaigns (US and Japan) sides of the Pacific war. While the US war was predictable and taken from history books, I've really enjoyed the ""WHAT-IF"" scenario of Japan's side if they'd actually won their battles in WW2.PROS:+Good gameplay! Played with the Xbox 360 Gamepad mostly, as the controls were tight with it. The keyboard and mouse are serviceable but I'd recommend playing with a gamepad instead.+""WHAT-IF"" scenario if Japan had won their battles on WW2.+Switching from controlling planes to ships to submarines never gets old!+Actual combat is pretty fun.+Impressive visuals (Graphics, models).+Lenghty campaigns. Can provide you with at least a good 20 hours of playtime.CONS: -Game For Windows Live DRM-Voice acting (both US and Japan) are quite weak. Many clichés from B-series movies!-Low quality cutscene footage with annoyingly voiceover.-Some mission can be tedious and very long to complete. (Difficulty spike on many Japanese missions.)RECOMMENDATION: Yes, I do recommend this game especially to anyone loving WWII setting! While it may not be perfect, it is a decent blend of action and strategy and to this day, I don't find many games that can offer you the chance to be playing with a huge Battleship! Just sad the developer got shutdown so another sequel doesn't seem very likely, unfortunately.RATING:7.5 / 10			",800,167,27,82,79,2,130

												i absolutely love this game to death. i keep coming back for more everytime i log on. everything about this game is a masterpiece from the graphics to the ships to the planes battlestations pacific is a truely wonderful game. although i was hoping that the battleships could open fire on each other from miles out i guess this isnt meant to be a full on simulator of ship vs ship battles. i was also hoping for a way to get the pearl harbor battleships and to play as them after they've been raised and rebuilt from there watery grave at pearl harbor but i guess that isnt going to happen either. but anyway i would say to get this game you will not be dissapointed.my only problems with the game is how the battleships cant fire off all there guns at once and how the ai loves to spam the most powerful units, that is frustrating. also how in multiplayer the planes dont actually launch from there carriers they spawn above it. other then that the game is perfect. this game is really fun either way and i cant recommend it enough.you can fly planes, steer ships, capture island bases, launch recon planes, use submarines, drop destroyer depth charges to kill subs underwater, launch planes from carriers, change the planes payload when selecting your aircraft and there is so much more to do in this game. there are two campaigns in this the american campaign which takes place after the battle of midway and starts off with the battle of the eastern solomons, and a fictional japanese campaign which starts off at the attack on pearl harbor. both campaigns require a lot of skill and effort to finally complete especially the last mission, and there are also 3 difficulty levels to choose from rookie, regular and veteran. both campaigns have a set number of main objectives you have to complete as well as the hidden objectives in order to get a gold medal on them. if you get a gold medal on certain missions you will unlock new units something that is definitely missing from todays games.

												I played this game a long time ago, and I got this on a steam sale, but it is unplayable because of one sole reason WINDOWS LIVE.It wants you to make an account so you make an account, then it asks you to sign into that account when you sign in it tells you to sign in AGAIN AND AGAIN!If you manage to get this game running you are a hero and there should be a day named after you for your persistence.

												Melhor jogo de batalha naval que ja vi, vc pode controlar mais de 100 unidades de uma vez no mapa, entre avioes, navios, submarinos e bases terrestres, sendo americano ou japonês. Vc pode controlar grande navios como o Yamato, grandes porta aviões e submarinos como o Gato americano e o I-400 japonês. Pode controlar grande aviões como o Bombardeiro B 29 superfortress. Recomendo a todos este super jogo da segunda guerra mundial. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												To whom it may concern. So did read system require thing an took a chance as a couple of guys in discussion reckon they got it working on 64 x windows 8.1 . I tried the stuff suggested an since i aint an ace on the laptop needless to say cant get it workin , shame as i remember it fondly from xbox 360 . Be good if steam had a system checker or summin if thats poss before the download but my bad for takin a chance really (maybe ?) .. Should really just work though as the only thing that let them dodge my wrath is the fact midway works no probs ? Got the two on a deal for a couple of pound an its good id say as there is alack of decent naval warfare games .

The game looks beautiful however The manufacture does not care about the consumer and the fact that they are selling a product that has no fix. The main problem with this game is it crashes back to desk top just right after the intro vidio....How do you fix this problem? I have sent many letters to both steam and the manufacture for help and I recived ZERO help that I can understand. I am not a tecky I want to come home after work and relax....play a game.....and chill out......NOT TRY TO REPROGRAM A GAME THAT SHOULD WORK !!! iTS SIMPLE MATH MAKE A PATCH THAT FIXES THE PROBLEM AND MAKE YOUR CONSUMERS HAPPY....Does any one from steam or the manufacture read how many people are having issues with this game,,,,,,If you guys want to sell it make sure it works first!!!! for every one....not just for your developers who know how to program and digg into the inner workings of a game.....I dont.....HELP!!!

												Graphically nice for its age and fun as hell, Battlestations Pacific sends the player into a battle against the mighty Japanease navy. You can pilot both air and sea and have a massive array of ships and planes. The story line is ok as well and it allows the player to use some kind of Tactical Map to control units like a RTS. Pros:Graphics are ok for the age.Nice ships and fun to drive.Historical and well done campaignCons:Windows live games. (I personally find this quite annoying)Mods but no mods (The modding community is small and with little content)So-so plane mechanics (I personally dislike the plane mechanics on this game. The planes dont have a nice feal to them)Rating:8/10. Yes I recommend this game to any one who wants a World War 2 Battleship game. Is it better than War Thunder. Hell no, but it is good for the age of it and will tie anyone over intill War Thunder gets ships. Also dont play for mods. Seriously they add nothing. That either means the game has enough or that no one mods this game.			",97,5,6,7,20,0,13

												This is literally one of the best naval strategy game i have ever play. You get to command your own fleet in RTS mode and also 3rd person mode. The game provide all kind of planes, ships, submarine from WWII including the experimental one. The campaign is slightly a letdown due to the lack of story and horrible Japanese voice acting but you can change the history by winning Battle of Midway and occupy Hawaii as the Imperial Japanese Navy even reaching San Francisco. Graphics is fantastic for its time but the ships lack damagae model (slightly a bit of let down). Even though you can play this game in 3rd person view but strategy is still the main factor in order to win naval battle which is make this game awesome. You can be the best plane pilot in the entire world but you won't last long in one plane when try to dive bomb a carrier group under heavy flak. Every single type of ship have its niche in the sea. Destroyer small but carry deadly torpedo that can sunk any kind of ship including carriers. Battleship heavy gun punch through anykind of armor. And submarine is the deadly underwater assassin that always waiting for you. OVerall this game deserve much more praise than average score on Metacritics. My final Verdict for this game is a 9/10 (Must own)If you have problem launching the game just install Games for Windows Live and then disable it later with disabler from Nexusmod ",84,14,0,19,5,0,16

												this is, in my opinion one of the best naval strategy games out there. the command aspect can take some getting used to and if you prefer more fast paced action, then this game my turn you away, here patience is key, with forward planning and strategic control over your units. there is the hitch that it requires the newest version of games for windows to work, but that is easily solved. some of the units can be a pain to unlock too, as the Iowa and the Yamato require 100% mission compeltion on the mission they are unlocked on and to unlock a unit on the final mission you need a gold, which is a complete NIGHTMARE, but at least there's checkpoints in this one, unlike the first game. Lastly the aiming is very wonky, so always aim at the bottom of ships			",26,2,0,1,7,0,6

												Definitely an improvement on Battlestations Midway in several aspects, yet the two are different experiences. Pacific is more arcade than serious, as planes re-arm in the air rather than return to base, some self healing units, and battles requiring barely any management. That Midway magic is gone, where you knew if you missed your aerial torpedo then you had wasted a plane trip, and the battle might turn against you as a result. If you want an easy to enjoy game, Pacific has the quality. If you want intense moments and punishing situations then stick with Midway. I find enjoyment in both.			",328,38,37,15,49,2,50

												A very good action/strategy came covering naval and air warfare. Runs very well, but it's major let down - to collosal proportions - is it's use of GFWL. If this annoying feature was revoked, I think I'd be able to play this game 24/7.			",103,14,0,29,45,1,48

												This game does not work on some systems that run windows 7. The game looks beautiful however The manufacture does not care about the consumer and the fact that they are selling a product that has no fix. The main problem with this game is it crashes back to desk top just right after the intro vidio....How do you fix this problem? I have sent many letters to both steam and the manufacture for help and I recived ZERO help that I can understand. I am not a tecky I want to come home after work and relax....play a game.....and chill out......NOT TRY TO REPROGRAM A GAME THAT SHOULD WORK !!! iTS SIMPLE MATH MAKE A PATCH THAT FIXES THE PROBLEM AND MAKE YOUR CONSUMERS HAPPY....Does any one from steam or the manufacture read how many people are having issues with this game,,,,,,If you guys want to sell it make sure it works first!!!! for every one....not just for your developers who know how to program and digg into the inner workings of a game.....I dont.....HELP!!!

												Cant even play this game!!! :(And this is not because my computer is too old. This game cant run due to the fact that the developers bonded this game with some Windows Games Market thingy that works with the XboxThe thing is that the games for windows live thing or application was shutdown and was stopped making this game unplayable. The developers and Steam still keep this game up for sale to get easy money/ or they just dont give a ****  I recommend you people to just ignore this game unless you really badly want to waste money or if you think you are a total nerd and think you can somehow make this game work without GFWL.That is why i do not recommend this game on steam. This game might be a very good and fun game just like BSM (Battle starions midway)  but the fact that you cant play it at the momment is what made me decide to not recommend it.			",68,7,1,5,17,1,12

												Dear Valve,please either take control over this game or remove it from the store. Firstly, it should say on the page that the game requires windows live to play, even though that this feature has been abandoned for years. I feel it is very misleading to the consumer, also some rich ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is making money somewhere not caring that the game is unplayable. It doesnt matter how much money I spent, it was money wasted. I warn anyone wanting to buy this game - Dont fall into the trap so many others did. Wait until Valve hopefully do something. I am asking Valve directly, please fix this problem. Its ripping people off and its giving you a bad reputation.			",41,5,0,5,6,1,8

												Arcade-yet-notOkay, so you get super quick repair times, except when you are more damaged it repairs less per second, as in, not only is there more to repair but it takes longer with 2 factors.Aiming is pretty easy, but armor is very effective so dont think ""Hey, all my shots hit the big ship! its dead""Nope. Maybe 1/16th of its health gone.If you like sinking stuff, training mode is probably the best for you....nothing fires back except 3 ships in naval mode...Bombing is relatively easy, just hold shift or whatever it was, and when the targets about to hit the ship, FIRE!Overall:PROS-Good graphics-Easy to learn-Soft on beginners-Great cutscenes, I feel like I'm in an interactive movie!-Controls are not over-the-top reactiveCONS-LONG Cutscenes, mainly in practice this is a problem-Ship damage listing wise is not good-Windows live seems to not let me make an account (you need it for cloud saving)-Windows live in generalPlay if you like somewhat arcadey games with a good story.The trailer does not lie.

												A great game, nobody seems to know about it for some reason.Good graphics, arcadish playing, but you get to play ships, subs, planes, in about 30 fun missions. Feel the might of a broadside from the Yamato ! Sink carriers with torpedo planes !  Make a surprise attack with your sub on an advancing fleet and try to escape chasing destroyers ! dogfight planes ! fly bombers and carpet bomb stuff ! You know you want to.There is a multiplayer as well.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An excellent prequil from the Battlestation series, Battlestation: Pacific brings the same classic action the first battlestation brough except it has been spit polished and been booted onto the battlefield. The action this game deliverse is pretty intense with a completely new ""HUD"" system and extremely powerful graphics to make you feel that your the pilot driving a plane full of explosive into an american war vessle in the name of the emperor. I would suggest buying this rather then purchasing battlestations: Midway purely because it includes the same gameplay except it is alot more indepth, richer and the graphics are 10x better. So unless you have an underaverage pc then i suggest that you pull your credit card out of your pocket and purchase this game right now!			",159,20,1,26,32,3,34

Unlike the prequel (Battlestations: Midway), Battlestations: Pacific doesn't use GameSpy. Instead they use Games for Windows - Live; another program that recently shut down.Although if you have an existing account, you can still log in and play Multiplayer with GFWL which is pretty awesome.You get the option of playing the regular US Campaign, which starts directly after the first game. Or the new Japanese Campaign, which starts from the first games Attack on Pearl Harbor and continuing on.Much more features were added into this game; you can unlock different boats and aircraft throughout missions. The graphics, cutscenes and cinematics are even more defined. The controls are much easier, you can switch between third and person view, and much more!The only downside, there are so many controls to learn it confuses you more then being helpful. Especially if you play other games and come back you'll have no clue how to play again.Besides excessive controls, this game is definately worth looking at!9/10 ",774,159,33,63,61,3,97

												This game has it's limitaions being it was made for console. It is still a nice game! Campaign for both Japenese and U.S. has a good story to it and is enjoyable to sit back and play. However the multiplayer is a different story. Island capture is a great game mode and is very fun to play with friends. There is a point systen in it that determins how many units you can spawn which is certainly a bottleneck for game play but still a console game. If you can find some firends who would be willing to play and learn this game it can be very fun going through a match online. But other than the story there isn't much more of a reason for you to buy it for just yourself unless it's on sale.Using a controler makes it easier to play unless you are determined to use keyboard. Also you can use the product key from this game to use GFWL on Fallout 3! I also play on Windows 10 so yes, it is playable and for everyone who has Windows 10 and it doesn't work. That opereating system isn't the problem. (Also played it on 7, 8, 8.1)			",41,1,0,5,7,0,12

												Battlestations Pacific is one of my favorite games out there. It is better the Battlestations Midway by a very long shot and Midway is the second best I really enjoyed and played all the time.Battlestations Pacific has a nice strategic map overview and you can handle aircraft, ships and other units by that map. Take over islands by huge ship battles or lose islands by paratroopers catching you off guard. Purchase major battleships and take them into action yourself. The campaign is difficult and it is suppose to be. Depending on the difficulty, you might have more than one objective for maybe one unit they supplied you with. It is really a great strategic game.I always played the skirmish more than anything with friends. Multiplayer is great and won't disappoint. Battles last a very long time, especially when doing island capture objective mode. I think the largest game I had was almost 8 hours long. They did not disappoint when Battlestations Pacific released and I was urging to get it once I found out they released another.I'd recommend this game to anyone (like always) who loves war games like these. Doesn't come close to the same old WWII fps shooters that have been made a million times!			",235,40,4,26,34,3,32

												A step up from the previous game in the series.  Plenty of battles to go through whether it be the campaigns of the USA or Japanese, or online, skirmishes you name it.  While it may take you awhile to get the hang of the sloppy controls, it still plays relatively well.  Pros:-  Best naval warfare game I've seen to date-  Follows the history pretty well for the most part-  Battles are tense, need to be tactical and think about what you do!-  Lots of content to keep you playing apart from the previous game.Cons:-  Clunky controls at times-  Too easy at times-  Some overpowered units-  Very bland AI			",50,0,0,3,2,0,6

												One of my all time favourite games, although it took some work getting it to work on Windows 10. Don't forget to download and install the live for windows client. See discussions.Unfortunately, if you don't already have a live profile (an xbox 360 profile will work) then this will not work for you.Flying the planes are okay, but the real fun is in controlling and using the ships. It's a bit like an 3d arcade version of battleships with planes thrown in the mix.Needs a new up to date HD version!Very recommended if you can run.  ",766,172,34,84,91,7,121

												I'd love to reccomend this game, because the gameplay seems spot-on. Unfortunately, getting GFWL to work on Windows 10 is a hassle enough as is, but pairing that with audio issues once in-game no matter what settings I put the game on killed it for me. I'd love to see this game re-done or a sequel made though. If you're still on Windows 7, you might want to give it a try (I heard Windows 7 users don't have nearly as much of a problem with this game), since you can refund it anyways if things awry.

												Despite it's clunky flight controls (something that is easely compensated if you use a xbox controller), this is still one of the most interesting WW2 strategy games I had the pleasure to play even though I was never a big fan of naval combat (I was more excited about the flight combat, although in this game, the flight combat is not as good as naval combat due to the game mechanics).Although the game came out several years ago, only in 2015 I had the chance of finally being able to get and play this game... and I'm glad I waited so long, since this game is better played with an xbox controller.The fact that the game allows you to play a different turn of events by playing as Japan is good to make some people wonder how would the Japanese victory change history.Fun and challenging gameplay, different mechanics from the usual RTS and a simple yet still good campaign mode.てんのへいかばんざい！			",238,71,5,33,20,4,41

I was really looking forward to playing this with a friend of mine, but I might as well uninstall it at this point. I'm not going to shell out $15 a month to play a game I payed $2 for.

												Game crashes at stage loading screen. No patches or solutions to be found online. Plenty of other people with the same problem.Edit: I deleted and redownloaded the game, and now can't even get past the splash screen as the Games for Windows Live prompt doesn't even pop up.Buying this game is basically spending money on not a game but on a CHANCE to be able to play the game. Judging from all the stuff I've seen on google while troubleshooting, and how there's a COMMUNITY GUIDE on how to try to get the game to work (I followed the instructions. It still didn't work.) I think I can conclude that your odds aren't very good.Don't buy this game.Edit: After messing around with a load of things it finally started working. That being said, whether or not it works still seems to be a total crapshoot so be warned.			",142,32,0,29,26,0,45

												Battlestations Pacific is an ok game at best. It features fairly fun gameplay that switches between controlling the battlefield and accually being a part of it. However, I get bored fairly quickly and move on to a different game.			",118,8,6,4,18,0,4

												THIS IS NOT A REVIEW OF THE GAME, THIS IS A WARNING ABOUT A FAULTY PRODUCT! Although unable to play the demo for reasons unknown, after watching a few videos about Battlestations: Pacific I was immediately sold. However, after purchasing it I discovered that I was unable to play the game just as I was the demo. Apparently there is quite a large portion the community who are also unable run it. While there are numerous methods on how to remedy this, no one solution is guaranteed to fix the “problem”. It pains me to admit that, for once, rather than the game's developers, the fault lies upon Steam. This product is being sold with no warning whatsoever that the software required to run it is no longer functioning and has very little hope of being repaired. Even EA's Origin has posted notices on a game's product description about major problems (such as the shutdown of GameSpy affecting the multiplayer services of the game Crysis 3). If you are still considering buying Battlestations: Pacific; you have been warned.			",120,8,1,8,24,2,38

												Ah I've had this game for several months and was not able to play it. I tried many different methods on how to get this game to run on windows 10. Months later I come back and I was able to finally get this game to run. I've seen other people post that you need that games for windows live thing and it's true well, at least for me. The way I got it to run is to make an account and then set that account to offline. The part where you make an offline account is when you're at the start menu and it brings in the games for windows menu.Launch the game up normally and it will take you to the screen with the planes. You press start and then it will load but not get past that screen, exit out. This time go into your files->OS:C ->steam->steamapps->common->Battlestations Pacific. Once you're inside the Battlestations Pacific folder right click on the first file that says battlestationspacific and click run as administrator. It will ask you for permission, click yes. This should work on Windows 10, it's just that you have to launch the game from within your files not on the desktop icon.Hope this helps anyone wanting to play this game. I literally bought a used xbox 360 just to play this because I needed a break from the grind in world of warships, but now I finally got it to run on my PC and I am very happy.ps. I finally got to sail out Yamato! Best shipgirl! ;) 10/10 very happy weeb			",31,1,0,2,2,0,0

												There are three parts to this game: air, water and tactical. Both the air and water aspects put you into the reigns of the machine allowing you to move and  fire as you wish. The planes feel fun and arcadey as you whizz around upside down and looping around trying to shoot things down or blow up ground targets and quickly change to the next plane when you get shot down. This is good fun as long as you're not looking for a simulation.The boats (which include submarines) have an equally arcadey feel as the main artillery guns are automatically adjusted for range. However, the problems with this game tend to start with the boats as shooting artillery is automatically a ranged for you (don't have to lead the target), the torpedoes aren't which make playing as a submarine particularly soul destroying. There's nothing to help adjust for range and even if you do manage to get it on target, the AI tends to have a fairly easy time in avoiding them simply by stopping, turning or speeding on. The marine warfare is often marred by overly long battles as there is no fast foward button that you might get in something like Silent Hunter. Having said that though, the artillery is fun and the guns are limited to side and maximum range to get you to think a little more about positioning. My main problem with this game comes in the form of the tactical map. It's awkward, clumsy, slow and you'll be putting in a lot of effort to do the simplist of things. The controls for it are fairly basic, you can order your troops to move, attack and follow. You also have the option (if you have a carrier, airfield or shipyard) to send out planes and ships. If you move them to a position they will automatically attack anything within range (even if you don't want them to, retreating is a difficult thing to get them to do). Unfortuntely, there is no way to automatically rebuild vehicles that get destroyed meaning that you'll often by coming back to your carrier menu to rebuild. While you get the option to change the secondary weapon for the planes, you won't know which ones got shot down that had which secondary weapons (such as torpedoes or bombs) without flicking through each of the living squadrons. There is also no way to set a rally point as far as I could tell which means that once you build your new planes, they will start flying around the carrier uselessly until you tell them otherwise, again, something that will bring you out of the action. I didn't like the fact that I spent half my time in the tactical map trying to hand hold my minions when I wanted to be playing the hero. Even if I did want to be in the tactical map, there are much more interesting tactical games out there with more options. I looked forward to the missions that took away the control of the tactical map.I did like the explanations of each battle, the historical information behind each vehicle and the hidden objects (which you get clues for). I enjoyed the idea of being able to jump into something I'm tactically controlling and I liked that the missions were varied and interesting. The game wasn't difficult on the middle difficulty setting. I did have to fiddle around with the game to get it to work on Windows 8.1 but that didn't take more than a quick google search.All in all, I wanted to like this game. I gave it 22 hours of my life but in the end the tactical map and the lack of precision with the ships wore away my patience.			",165,23,3,15,17,2,37

												This game is incredible, it has sea combat, under sea combat, and air combat, the game has a plenty of ships and two factions to use as well as plenty of planes to use. I recomend this game to anyone who likes being in control of ships, planes, and submarines being able to destroy other ships, planes, and submarines			",39,3,0,8,2,0,5

												Great game fun to play! The Multiplayer is dead though. If you need help getting it to start here are a few things to think about.Download games for windows liveIt is possible to create a offline G4WL- accountDon't ever change the voice over setting to ""English Authentic Voiceover"", it will crash the game and it won't give you any reason as to why it crashed the game.This is an old game and it has its problems on newer platforms and i don't think it was bug free when it came out either. It is however, despite its problems a really fun game to play and if you ever manage to get a full multiplayer session you WILL have one heck of a naval battle.The game lets you play under the water, on the water and in the air. There are several multiplayer modes they all resemble the classics, deathmatch, team deathmatch and the battlefield conquest game mode. There are a few other types as well such as escort and seige.

												I played Battlestations Midway when I was a young kid and I was hoping to relive some childhood memories by playing Battlestations Pacific. But, as soon as the game starts up, you have to sign into Microsoft Windows LIVE. Which isn't that big of a problem aside from the fact that Microsoft doesn't support Windows LIVE anymore! It's complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and almost unbelieveable that Steam would even continue to market this game anymore. Honestly, I'm just going to try to get a refund for this game. This isn't fair at all. And nowhere on the store page does it say that Microsoft Windows LIVE is required. HOWEVERFrom the time I have played on this game, all features work perfectly fine. But, the singleplayer campaign is unplayable considering it won't save progress because of Windows LIVE. And multiplayer is also unavailable. 1/10♥♥♥♥ you Microsoft Windows LIVE			",61,2,15,4,12,1,18

												Buy it on sale then play through the campaign but DONT exit out, otherwise your progress will be lost due to Games for Windows Live.Even in death, it still haunts you.The naval warfare / air combat mix is very enjoyable gameplay but I couldn't play the final US mission because I lost all my saved game progress.Still a solid game tough.

												Game REQUIRES Windows Live to play multiplayer.Lan doesnt work at all apparently.Quite disappointed in those facts. I was really looking forward to playing this with a friend of mine, but I might as well uninstall it at this point. I'm not going to shell out $15 a month to play a game I payed $2 for.

												Game crashes at stage loading screen. No patches or solutions to be found online. Plenty of other people with the same problem.Edit: I deleted and redownloaded the game, and now can't even get past the splash screen as the Games for Windows Live prompt doesn't even pop up.Buying this game is basically spending money on not a game but on a CHANCE to be able to play the game. Judging from all the stuff I've seen on google while troubleshooting, and how there's a COMMUNITY GUIDE on how to try to get the game to work (I followed the instructions. It still didn't work.) I think I can conclude that your odds aren't very good.Don't buy this game.Edit: After messing around with a load of things it finally started working. That being said, whether or not it works still seems to be a total crapshoot so be warned.			",142,32,0,29,26,0,45

												To be honest I expect something better... Naval and Air combat is ok, but far away from what I was expecting to see. The campaign is alright. The skirmish part of the game is disappointing. You can only selected predefined scenarios, with predefined units. If you expect large scale confilict, look somewhere else...			",113,52,1,11,3,1,21

												Pilot Airplanes, Battleships and Submarines in WWII. Two factions, USA and Japan. Plays best with Friends, since the Multiplayer is dead. Uses games for Windows Live so beware. It's not a sim but quite atmospheric and slow-paced. The UI Controls are a bit wonky, once you get used to them it's good fun.The studio closed so it looks like there won't be a third Battlestations game in the near future.			",414,126,49,53,55,4,90
