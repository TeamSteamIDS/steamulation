												I LOVE THIS GAME.1739 hours played so far, loved every minute of it- and I only have 2 saved games- that is how much of a marathon this game is. Brilliant and simple in its design, you are tasked with allocating resources to make people happy. I love the visuals (the townsfolk particularly) and the ship battles, to name only a few aspects of this gem of a game. If you like civilization/city building games, this one is probably for you. There are always tons of side missions to do that you can pick up at the taverns and there is a ton of useful automation in the game (auto trading ftw). One of my favorite games of all time, so glad I picked it up for a few bucks. Watching the effect your efforts have on the landscape (cities, populations, developments) is very rewarding. LOVE THIS GAME!			",20,1,0,9,3,0,10

												Before buying this game you need to ask yourself what kind of gamer are you. If you're the kind who likes hours of tedious building and trading than this is a good game for you. If you like heart pumping action and need your games to excite and amaze you then this game is not for you. The beauty of Patrician 3 is in it's long term gameplay which has you slowly work your way from a humble trading shopkeeper to a master merchant. It does this through good AI, an excellent economic model, brilliant pacing, and diverse challenges. It's a game that know what it wants to do and does it better than most other economic simulation.			",113,17,0,49,47,0,86

												If you like business management types of games of the likes of the old Koei games such as Uncharted Waters/New Horizons, this game might be right up your alley.  Action game fans... probably should look elsewhere. Unlike Uncharted Waters, you control a whole company, safely ensconced in your corporate headquarters, while directing whole fleets of ships to run trade routes.  Once you build up a set routine route, you can even just automate the route, so that the ship sails between up to around a dozen ports buying and selling the same things over and over for a profit.The best aspect of the game, however, is how much of a subtle, but ever-growing impact you have on the world with your actions.  The more you trade with a city, the more it prospers economically, the more its population rises, the more it has to trade, but the more it needs to trade to get products it doesn't manufacture, itself.  Then, you can outright build a branch office in a city, build up your own personal industries, and outright control the whole city.  It's dirt cheap at sale prices, and if you have any interest in the genre at all, it's worth looking into before going into more pricey, more modern versions of the same game.

												No eye candy, this game is about playability. Simply brilliant. Calls for lots of tweaking and micro management, but not in a way a becomes tedious to do so. Just enough to give you the feeling you are doing exactly what is needed. Various levels of play make the game challenging for all levels. I think I will still be playing this in 30 years from now (when no decent successor surfaces). The best of the series, better than earlier AND later versions of Patrician. The best trading game out there to date.			",13,1,0,4,3,0,13

												I really like this game. BUT I cannot recommend it. Since I upgraded to Windows 10, I have found it impossible to run in any graphics mode except 800x600. That I can put up with. The biggest problem is the frequence of the crashes. It crashes also everytime I run it, and running the Compatibility Troubleshooter seems to make it worse.I have complained to Kalypso Media about, their response was:-""thank you for your ongoing interest in Patrician 3 but the developers moved on to more recent projects. There are currently no patches / updates planned to establish compatibility with windows 8 or 10.""I find it very disturbing that Kalypso and Steam are continuing to sell the game, when there are so many problems with it and there are no plans to make it compatibile with modern hardware.

												I remember spending a lot of time on this game back in 2005, didn't even knew it was available on steam and as soon as I saw it I bought it.After 10 years this is still the better episode of the saga, ambientation and music are fantastic, gameplay is entertaining as usual, and mods are awesome, now i can run this in 16:9 and HD thanks to the guys who shared the modded files on steam.I still wouldn't reccomend this saga to people who don't like the genre, it's a very specific-targeted game (trading sims aren't the most popular games) and if you don't like the basics the advanced gameplay won't entertain you no more.For strategic/trading sim fans this is a must have game, if you'd like to get into this saga you should definitely start from this one!

												So you are thinking of buying Patrician III, here are the questions you have to ask yourself.1. Did you play Uncharted Waters on NES or SNES as a child? Did you also play Sim City? Are you German? Do you like business sims? If you answered no to at least 2 of these, Maybe not.2. Do you like time sinks? Slightly hard learning curves? Micro managment?  If you answered no this game probably isn't for you.3. Do you love building an empire? Fighting pirates? Trading sims? Well it might just be.If you are even reading this review then you somehow stumbled over this game and it might actually be for you, Patrician III has a steep learning curve but is a great empire building game but it is a time sink the like of which diehard WOW players can be jealous of. Pros: You are responsible for everything that happens to you. Your empire (or failure to build one) is enirely on your shoulders. It is addictive and engrossing and gives ""one more turn"" a run for it's money. Cons: It's a complicated game and actually requires you to learn things (not a con for me but maybe for you). Getting the screen ratio to work on anything past windows 98 requires googling (it works but ♥♥♥♥ if it isn't a pin in the♥♥♥♥♥Epilogue: Buy it. With steams new refund policy if you cant find enjoyment within a couple hours it probably isn't the game for you. For the rest of us? We will own the Hanse.			",22,9,0,16,31,0,9

												In my third year of university and finding myself taking several accounting classes. Due to this excessive exposure to balance sheets and ratios I find a perverse need to accrue profits: by any means necessary. So, whip out a notebook. Get a highlighter, a quill and some ink. Perhaps make some candles. Then light them, because you are about to embark on a deep dive into medieval trade federations and in this darkness you will need all the light you can get. This game needs calculations, more guides would be nice. If you are not smart with expansion and diversification you will find yourself doing a lot of needless port grinding. However, if you can record the proper sales prices/buying prices, recruit a captian, and send convoys out abroad.. you may be on to something.I love everything about this game. The AoEII graphics, the polish (Whaaat? polish? you must be crazy) No, for reals. The attention to detail is very nice: in game oddities like marriage, hiring pirates, and borrowing/loaning money for negotiable interest can make or break your game in the best way. These types of additions allow you to pursue the main campaign quest (becoming Patrician) in unorthodox ways. Loaned money? ""The guy can't make ends meet."" Seize his assets. ""Whats he got?"" Loads of Wood. ""♥♥♥♥"" Build fleet of Snaikka and sell it to pirates. Get all the booty. Continuely refine trading routes and expand until you have too much money, build fleets and bribe princes. Pillage ports. Make more money, build more fleets. Invade mediterranean sea. 11/10 would watch for police while hiring pirates again. (they can catch you bro.) ",29,11,0,14,8,0,16

												Excellent economic-based trading game.Pros:-Not only do you run around working the trade system, but you also manufacture, therefore supply your manufacturing facilities with the needed materials.-Not only do you build extra ships and upgrade them to enlarge your fleet, but you build throughout the towns you trade in; homes manufacturers, warehouses, and more.-Lead an active roll in the economy; get married, join the guilds, aid or hinder the different classes, compete with the areas other master merchants, defend against pirates, buy or sell in auctions, run for mayor, and much more.-Take specific jobs; escorting, transporting, and smuggling.-Turn to the dark side; hire scores of pirates to do your bidding for a fair cut of the treasure, attack other merchants and towns directly.Cons:-Has 5 bloody tutorials..... FIVE.  And they still leave a lot to be answered.... Needless to say, the game is COMPLICATED.  Plan on looking a LOT of things up on youtube and asking the community questions.-Attacking pirates are ALWAYS more powerfull.  You're either out-numbered, out-gunned, outmanned, or all three.  VERY frustrating, as the ""Flee"" option almost never works.The trade system is top notch, They do a REALLY good job of balancing the economic system.  They do a really BAD job of ballancing the combat system.  As long as you can avoid fighting, the game is great fun.6/10			",21,1,0,12,6,0,11

												Good old german business simulators! What'd we do without them?This is rather an old game, but it still holds up well nowadays. It's a calm, quiet little game that I greatly enjoy for when I need to relax. The worst table punching moments are having ships attacked by pirates, and you can avoid doing battles manually as you desire.Highly recommended, especially at the price nowadays.

Its quiet an old one but it still has its fun.I liked the ""realistic"" view, the unknown town-popularity, The unknown ""what you need to do"" to get a higher rank, the bathhouse, the possibility to train townguards and so much more. I hoped to get a more complex, detailed Patrician IV but they realy destroyed it. So I always come back to this old game and love playing it.

												Tutorial is one of the drawbacks. It could have been done better. Firstly, you need to stare in the small letters at the bottom of the screen and reading this is quite tiring. Secondly, not all the instructions are clear. Also, there's no control system that would check if a player did the requested action correctly. The  tutorial is rather some kind of a guide book rather than a tutorial. Reading it all can take you up to 2  hours. Also, the tutorial doesn't explain everything, so it's wise to try a free game after the tutorial before getting to the campaigns. This will help you to learn the game by trial and error.Graphics is not so great but it is decent and it reminds me of those games in the nineties. This can be a virtue as well as fault. Depends on what you like. The idea is simple: try to be the best merchant in the world. It turns out not to be so easy as you could have thought at first.The game is challenging and even you know which city needs what kind of goods, it's still not easy to get rich. The clock is ticking and you need to act fast and with conviction. Learning the game will last a few hours as the tutorial is more about controls than substance of the game. But this can be a good point. One is sure: you need to acquire balance between selling and expanding your real estates.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												“Who doesn't want to become the richest man of the city and then the Governor of the Hanseatic League? “In this old success strategy game (over one million copies sold in a short time when he has been released) you impersonate an humble merchant in one of the twelve historical cities of the Hanseatic League, in the 1300.

												Have been playing this game for a while now. And i can tell, the game is not perfect, but almost. If you're into some supply and demand kind of stuff, this is the best game you could buy. For real, it's an awesome, slow paced, strategic, economical game and you MUST try it, if you like those old school games. I bought it for 0.44€ and it worth al least 3€. You won't regret.BTW:I'm playing on WIN8.1 and it runs just fine! I don't know what is the problem with these other guys that say this won't run, GO AHEAD! 9.7/10 for what it is.AAAAAND it's real-time so you can play it while you're on Facebook or whatever. Go ahead! Set a route, go to your email, see if the ship is already on it's destiny! If not, keep on browsing! You can even change the speed if the game!You want too be a pirate?! Plunder them all! It has a lot of freedom in what you can do, just give it a time!Cons: The graphics (its a game from 2003, following its ansestors).Not for everyone (if you're a casual gamer, please, go ♥♥♥♥ youself).

												Works well on Windows 10 with compatibility mode (Win XP SP 2). Apply this on the executable (steamapps folder) and it should work, for me it did.I played the game in my childhood and unlike some other games it was instantly fun to play again. The trading aspect is a bit monotonous but this also makes this game easy to play and to get into. Changing prices and finding out where to sell high and buy low makes this game fun. Of course you can adjust the difficulty settings to make things a bit more challanging if you wish to.Here is basically what you do: Take a ship and sail from harbor to harbot and sell and buy goods by different prices. You can have more ships over time and have to deal with pirates at some point. Prices vary but there are towns with high and low production of each good. Furhtermore you can build warehouse in towns and even production facilities to produce your own goods and make profit with those.I like that the game offers new challanges and opportunities over time. I think there is even times of war in towns and such special times offer new opportunities for you as a merchant. Basically I wrote this to show that it is playable on Windows 10.

												If you've read my Port Royale 2 review, this one is going to look very familiar. The Patrician series is quite a bit older, actually, with this installment originally appearing in 2000 whereas the original Port Royale appeared in 2003. While both allow you to tool around the high seas and peddle your wares at exotic ports of call, Patrician goes quite a bit deeper into the social aspect, allowing you to grow far beyond your starting station as a simple merchant.Your mercantile adventures will take you all over the 14th century Hanseatic League (which was around northern Europe and the Baltic Sea, for the historically impaired), to ports from London to Oslo. Travel takes place on a static map, from which you can move to detailed towns presented in a charming, isometric 2D view. At the harbors you can buy and sell goods to make your bones, but there are also tons of buildings in towns with various options. You can hire crew and meet informants in the taverns, check local politics and take contracts at the town hall, pray and donate money at the church, and even treat yourself to a nice bath at the bathhouse.The meat of the game, at least early on, is the trading and it isn't as simple as it looks. Each town produces certain goods and consumes all of them at a rate determined by the population and industries present, so it's important to know the makeup of each one you want to do business in. Prices are also based on supply and demand so you can't just run beer from the beer town to the drunk town because they won't have drunk it all by the time you make your second trip. It'll take some time to learn who needs what where, but if you're invested in the game you'll be making the big money in no time.Once you've got a grip on trading and started to expand your operations, that's where the game opens up in a way Port Royale does not. You have a reputation in each town that's dependent on your trading and actions, but also on how you choose to support the town. It goes deeper than just building your own workshops and houses, because you can invest in the local economy, make donations and throw festivals, and eventually become part of the town leadership. Being elected mayor of a town opens up a whole new set of options regarding military forces and infrastructure, which is a compelling long-term goal to add onto such an open-ended game.It may be a deeper game than most trading sims, but that also adds to the complexity and Patrician does not handle that aspect very well. A lot of key factors like your reputation with a town are hidden from you, conveyed only in vague qualitative terms. It can also be hard to understand some of the unique tasks you can take on. I agreed to marry and was instructed to stock my warehouse for the wedding festivities, but nowhere did it explain what goods I needed for the celebration. Some events can also cause you major setbacks if they affect your standing in important towns.All of these elements combine to give Patrician a steeper learning curve than most sims, though it's an understandable price to pay for the additional complexity. It's a game that you have to commit to learning and making mistakes in a way that Port Royale is not, but the potential payoff is a lot greater. The presentation only helps draw you in, with lovingly rendered towns and citizens and a pleasant, understated audio setup. In the end I might be more of a Caribbean man, but I can't deny that Patrician III is the deeper game, taking its trading game to impressive lengths.			",488,212,8,71,62,7,65

												I have given this game a fair shake and I can both recommend it and recomend against it depending on what you want out of this game and whether you've played it's successors (Rise of Venice, Port Royale 2&3, and Patrician 4). Buy it if you: Want a complex and engaging trading and business managing game with a fair addition of politics and hands-off town management. Can overlook a dated interface, unintuitive mechanics and little explanation. (Both a tutorial, manual and Wiki exist tho!)Avoid (in favor of its successors) if you: Prefer a more streamlined experience, with quality of life improvements at the cost of less complexity. Require better graphics (although this is really not the selling point of this series) In general I was well amused by the game and will surely continue playing, thus I recommend it, albeit only for the more dedicated fans of the genre (niche) and series.

												One of the best historical strategy games about being a merchant. Although it might not offer the same possibilities in some areas as Guild 2, I still consider it much better.Pros:1. I really love the style of the game - its graphic, the way you feel when playing it, the whole immersiveness of it. It's not dated one bit.2. Many different ports to explore and many different goods to trade.3. Ability to influence politics of your city or the whole Hanse, depending on how succesful you are, and generally politics are quite immersive.4. Countless side-missions, shady characters, and the ability to be a pirate. Or hunt them.5. It might not be easy to master, but it is really worth it.Cons:1. Nothing really, apart from not being able to play as someone else than merchant/politician, but well, it was unthinkable for a respected merchant to be a patron or a farmer, so I guess it's historically accurate.2. Well, perhaps I'd like to have some more interaction with your family to really feel like you're shaping a dynasty.			",70,60,7,45,108,1,58

												Usually, old games on Steam only appeal to people who played them in their heyday. Not this one. I never owned this game back then, or any other Patrician, but I think it is amazing. I can't put it down.The graphics are nothing special... they're OK, but the game has just the right balance of ease and complexity, the difficuly curve will give you setbacks, but not frustrate you, and the rules are easy enough to pick up, but hard to master.I bought that bundle they're selling... the one that has the art game too? I haven't played the other games yet but Patrician III alone is worth that price.By the way, if you're considering this or one of the 'The Guild' games, I'd get this. The Guild games have a lot of bugs but Patrician III is very smooth.			",33,14,1,22,26,3,7

												This is still one of my favourites of all time! The micromanagement necessary to tweak your trading routes to getting every last gold coin out of them is simply fascinating. There is nothing more satisfying than seeing your fleet grow and setting up more and more elaborate traderoutes, exploring even the mediterranian sea to get valuable spices back to northern europe all while growing your home city and expanding its borders as the mayor they all love.Truely a classic and hasnt lost any of its appeal even though the graphics are very outdated by now.

												Patrician III is a very well balanced trading game, I followed it from the beginning when it was still Patrizier II in German, with an add-on later. The forum was overwhelming and explained the game in the smallest details. Everything works together, you just can't build workshops for instance without having the materials but also because you do not have enough workers, because they do not have a home. so I play this game for over 20 years now and when I stop, after a few years I restart it for the x-th time. Ten out of ten!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An all around classic that is as good now as it was on release. Doesn't hold your hand very much so getting it can take work, but the general gist of simple. Early game is trading. This moves onto logistics as you open your own production buildings. Then politicing as you try to become mayor of your own town, then Alderman. Not to mention building your own trading posts, which is always my favourite.			",71,5,6,17,68,1,83

												This game extends your mind to the world of commerce and trade. One false move or random event can send you spiraling into demise. Such as a pirate plundering your ship, and all your cash...At the same time though, this initial difficulty curve can be easily overcome by just playing through the tutorials thoroughly and then going for a few trial runs, and learning the feel for the game. You then learn what's what and get a few more ships, and even a town, eliminating the random events completely knocking you off your socks.For $5, it's a veritable steal. (Although I got it for peanuts with the Patricians and Merchants pack back when it was $2.50!)			",287,25,2,31,28,5,47

												This game is utterly amazing. IMPORTANT: The main thing you need to do after buying it, is to make it run under Windows 10. There are ways. I personally recommend this: https://steamcommunity.com/app/33570/discussions/0/35221584425332491/There are not many games so enjoyable even 16 years after release. I am still coming back to this game every few years and spend 30 to 100 hours.What is so special about Patrician 3? It was made by a German developer with GREAT care and a lot of love paid to details. It has nice 2D graphics, good sound effects and amazing gameplay.There is a well-simulated economy and a huge variety of activities to immerse oneself into. A feast for the mind. If you know how good it feels to excercise your mind, you will fall in love with this game.This game teaches you that if you care about people and make them happy, you can rise in society. You can also rise if you care about your town and improve it. You can also rise if you outsmart your competition and expand your company. You can also rise if you are a crap of a person but know which strings to pull and how to manipulate the public opinion. Just like in real life.None of your actions here remain unnoticed. Reputation is the key. The ""dark side"" is also possible. Get ready for pirating, bribes and brutal politics.You will like this game if you like developing things and making something better. Patrician 3 is so rewarding and so well-made that I would recommend it to anyone, who likes economic simulators, ships, business development and products made with a lot of love and care.P.S.: Every time you return to game (i.e. load), make sure you take a bath and pray at the church. You are welcome.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You will not like this game if:If you understand nothing about basic market mechanisms and you have no intention to get into it.If you don't like detailed and complex gameplay.If you like winning after 20 minutes.If you hate 2D games or oldies and you prefer AAA mind blowing games.If you do not have time to think or plan ahead and instead you prefer straight forward gameplay.If you are not afraid to play an old game that does not offer entertaining sea battles.Patrician 3 is an interesting game that is surprisingly well balanced. In that sense it is not too hard to understand how the game works but if you want to explore all the aspects of the game then yes you will find challenges. E.g - not running your business to bankruptcy isn't hard. You buy for 1 you must sell for 2. However attaining the rank of Patrician and becoming a local politician requires you to maximise profit, minimise cost, optimise trade routes, or utilise ""auto-trade"" tool etc. Indeed You need to reach a certain level of wealth in order to explore the entire gameplay.Review 8/10			",57,6,0,8,10,0,8

												OVERALL--------------The game is very subtle.  Economies can be chaotic (where someone just floods a market and you have to wait for it to dry up before it's profitable again).  I'm always feeling like I'm on the verge of losing, and by some miracle it continues.Some strategies do turn out to be a complete disaster and I have to revert to a previous save to continue.The game mechanic feels ""like German engineering"" - meticulously detailed and almost overwhelming.The game sort of reminds me of my first all-nighter game-plays of Civ II - where there is a grandiousity that can be achieved with many parallel elements in play.  I'm just beginning to get glimpses of that ""big"" feeling the game has to offer.PROGRAMMING-----------------------You don't have to, but the game includes all the mechanisms needed to program ship routing (similar to programming resource shipping in Sid Meier's Colonization).  It's very satisfying to set up a stable system that allows going into fast forward and just rakes in the money.YES/NO?-------------I highly recommend it - but only if you are in no hurry.  I get the feeling this game could take hundreds of hours just for one or two games after having mastered it.  It's mind-bogglingly slow, with a million things to keep track of.			",40,9,2,27,29,1,32

												You start out with a ship and some money. Buy some goods, transport them to another town, avoiding pirates, and sell the goods for a profit. Rinse and repeat until you have a trading fleet, then some them on auto-trade to do the work for you. When you have enough cash, you can start building businesses and houses for additional income. You have to really pay attention to trade routes once you have businesses, because they can sink you fast if goods sit in warehouses for too long.Supply a town with enough goods for long enough, and you can become the Lord Mayor of the town. Do missions for the Hanse, and you can become Alderman, the top position in the game.Overall Patrician 3 is a great game, especially for the price. Late game is pretty much devoid, once you become Lord Mayor and then Alderman there is nothing to do with those positions. You just call meetings as an Alderman or defend your town from sieges as a Lord Mayor. Cash is only useful for buying ships/goods/buildings, so stockpilling cash at late game is rather pointless. Still, the fun lies in building your trade empire from nothing.NOTE: This game is currently in a bundle with two other games. I haven't played the other two games, but the bundle is only $3 more and the other game goes for $10, so I would buy that bundle instead of just this game.			",25,2,0,14,10,0,16

												This is a good game. Apparently, I just don't have what it takes to be good at it and advance to make it enjoyable past the point I have reached. I became frustrated after 26 hours of trying and gave up for now. I only plan attempting it again when I am bored, between other games, or when the longing for it surfaces again. It is not a matter of a negatively constructed learning curve. In fact, learning how to play is not an issue at all. There are five tutorials, and they do an okay job at introducing the player to the game. The first campaign focusing on player advancement also instructs and gives hints appropriately, even though not with very much detail as to how to accomplish certain more convoluted aspects of the game. Even after consulting one extensive Wiki and three FAQ pages online, the game is still too difficult for me to succeed in. I've tried, once again, for 26 hours, every strategy and approach known to the experts, and I still would not succeed. The other AI controlled merchants in the game were light years ahead of me. All of the more in-depth reviews seen here are true and accurate. I just simply became frustrated at being mediocre or worse in the game, after 26 hours of trying. The game is difficult to be successful in. It's as simple as that. Perhaps this is a game that requires much more patience, and many more hours to be fully enjoyable.Patrician III is okay.

												Windows 10 updated and the game works perfectly.Sometimes in the main menu the game proves itself not to be very tab-friendly but in-game doesn't seem to give any issue.Now about the game, i've been loving this for years since a cousin of mine showed it to me and we started to play multiplayer...The game is simple graphically speaking but it's depth and market control is ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE.You need to play and play until you actually start getting an idea about how pricing works. What buys are worth or even if you SHOULD take a risk with a high cost buy because you are short of money but you know that product has a high demand somewhere else...Why is it a risk? Because you are not the only trader around...There've been so many times i reached a city with no meat or wine...just to see how an AI trader sold like 20 or 30 units IN MY ♥♥♥♥ING FACE to the city cockblocking my otherwise great benefit from trade...Trade your way to glory, fight the law becoming a pirate or be a pirate hunter yourself....This game is AMAZING!

												Hi gamers. Sadly I bought this game on the reviews. Unfortunately it does not work with win 8.1 x64. So I can confirm what DJ Ricky D posted. It really is a pity that this is not mentioned in the System Requirements since there are in some cases specific mention in this regard. The intro movies plays just fine but at the options screen everything is an ugly pink and cyan. It also does not support 1920x1080 16:9. So if you run windows 8 stay away.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

At least GoG tried to put out a patch for the game even though that didn't work for me either though the GoG patch did work for others.

												I'm sure its a lovely strategy game but just try and get it running on modern machines.  Graphical glitches made the game unplayable.  Imagine every 100x100 grouping of pixels flickering in random directiosn for a hint of the headache enducing assault on my eyes.  A mouse pointer leaving trails of ghost images of itself until it has clogged the screen.  Menues that are invisible until you run the cursor over them.  Producing a kind of rubing image that you may be able to interact with if the afformentioned mouse cursor ghost images do not obscure what your are looking at too much.  The readme file links unoffical patches for Voodoo graphics cards, so if you're still rocking one of those you may be in luck.  Do not waste your money unless you are into the challenge of getting older games to function with modern displays and GPU's.  And if you do, let me know how you did it because this does look like a fun strategy game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I like city building and business management style games, but I found the pace of Patrician III to be too slow, and I couldn't figure out how to get enough influence in any city beyond my home city to be able to construct buildings.  I'm sure the game becomes better once you get the hang of it, but after several attempts, I decided I didn't want to spend any more time sending my ship around in circles trying to find profitable trade routes (but never seeming to make any large amounts of cash).  Luckily I'd purchased it on sale for practically nothing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
