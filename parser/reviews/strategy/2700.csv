												Let's start here. Unlike many other RCT games, this game allows you to build in ways you could never build. Unlike many, this game allows to create a park, in your own image. The first game allowed you to just that, but, only, instead of simple rides, this allows you to include things you never could.                                                                              - Fireworks                                                                             - Waterfalls                                                                             - Zoo's                                                                                 and                                                                             - Swimming Complexes ( Pools. )This game brings 3D into a new direction for the games, even though, in my own opinion, the old games were just as good.Now, you might wonder... ""How is this game any different?""Here are a few reasons. - 3D graphics- More food/drink/misc stands.- Guests are renameable- You can speed up or even pause the gameand - Fireworks are able to be used.and so on. This has been Redman and his current perspective of the game.			",52,3,1,2,15,2,7

												""When you are in Hell, only the Devil can help you out""In RollerCoaster Tycoon 3, watch as thousands of helpless guests wander into a seemingly harmless amusement park of deadly traps, such as unfinished rollercoasters headed straight for populated swimming pools. Imprison tourists in unescapable, endless loops of riding the same rides over and over again; for simply asking of lowering the $10 price of admission to the restrooms. Create 'water' slides leading to 40ft deep concrete floors, and wonder how the authorities still have not caught onto your selfish game of sadistic torment; as the endless supply of unknowing families stray themselves into a permanent vacation.By far the greatest Saw game ever created.

												This is a game that take some time and dedication to truely enjoy. Yes there are people out there who love to just line up all the peeps into the main area, and just blast them to smitherines. This is fun yes, but this is the playstyle that would lead to reviews of ""not having any replay-ability"". This is just based on how that person played the game, ignore it, and move on. If you have patience, and a good creativity, make a campain world, and you can prosper. There is sandbox (even for those that are creative it is an amazing outlet) which is like any game's creative mode, allowing infinite building. This has been one of my top five games for most of my life, and will most likely remain there.Graphics 7/10- While the look of most things is amazing, closer up you can almost taste 2006, but that aside the gameplay it-self is amazing (I personally have not looked into it, but I'm quite sure someone out there made a texture pack or twenty)Gameplay 10/10- It allows many stories to be played, and can take quite a while (My current time from steam is flawed, I actually have had this game since 2009, and have logged at least 200 hours)Replayability 9/10- as I said, the game is indeed boring for those without patience or creativity, and I tend to lack in patience, this is my own personal opinion (From any official opinion, I would easily give it a 10/10)Overall 9.5/10 Amazing game, and a texture pack would put the icing on the cake*Note*For those of you that are the crash and burn kinda people, just letting you know, the peeps are indestructable, believe me I tried VERY hard (Crushing, drowning, melting, more crushing, smashing, throwing, dropping, etc.)All in all I hope that based on your personal experiences with you own past gaming, you can enjoy this game as well. A excellent use of your $20.			",109,9,0,3,13,0,4

												RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 allows you to create any theme park you can think of. From one that can be extremely fun for the families coming to visit or basically a death park due to unsafe rollercoasters and waterslides.Sandbox Mode- With unlimited money, you can make the park as cheap as you want at no cost. Also you can build whatever you want provided you have the space to do so.- However, it should be noted that if you overload your park with too much stuff such as long complex rollercoasters it is possible that your game will crash upon loading that specific parkCampaign Mode- This is basically a challenge mode- It can be fun a rewarding to see your park go from making basically no money at all to earning thousands in a day!

												Will you create a family friendly wonderland or a murder park of death? This is the question I ask myslef every time I start a new game. RollerCoaster Tycoon 3: Platinum allows you to create your dream theme park, complete with selling overpriced souvenirs and cleaning vomit filled sidewalks. Let your creativity run wild as you hire mechanics that get lost if they aren't on a footpath, hire creepy mascots and overall ruin the childhoods of thousands of children.

												Hands down, a childhood memory and great game! When I was a little gamer, I would play this game all the time. Building theme parks my way and style. This game is STILL such a masterpiece with old graphics that work fine for the gameplay. You can freely make your own park on Sandbox mode or start from old ones in campaign mode. If you like theme parks and creating games, this is a must. Furthermore, you can design your own rollercoasters and place down food and drink buildings for the visitors to eat and...drink. Pretty much everying you can do in a theme park slammed on this game! You can make pools, including wave pools aswell. Hire entertainers, janitors, engineers, and sercurity guards to make guests including yourself feel right at home. When I found out this was on steam I instantly bought it. I want you to do the same thing. BUY IT NOW.PROS:+ My childhood game.+ Good graphics to this date.+ Unlimited Possibilites+ Make your own everything.+ Campaign and Sandbox mode.CONS: - Creating hills is nearly impossible and ruins your park if you don't know what your doing.-  Animal's are hard to do in this game aswell as creating a GOOD waterpark.

RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 – Platinum! is a theme park sim-tycoon game. You are put in charge of a your own theme parks which you must expand to bring more customers and money to them.Pros: You have a large variety of rollercoasters, rides, kiosks and themed decorations to lay, often more than you'll be able to cram in a single map. You manage the finance by determining costs for rides, food and souvenirs, balancing against running costs, staff wages and other expenses including research which allow you to access even more rides and objects for your park. You start your career with a short selection of maps and a few pre-made rollercoaster designs, and unlock more as you achieve goals in each locations. And with the Soaked! and Wild! expansions that add even more attractions such as aquatic rides and zoological exhibits, you can play the same map over and over yet build different parks every time! Many rides allow themed-customization as well, from color scheme to cart-style or train-length. Micromanagement can also be as deep as you want it: you can go as far as choosing how much pickles a specific burger stand puts in its 1/4-pounder, or don't bother with it, it's up to you.Cons: The graphics are bad when zoomed in, from character designs to fixed-shadows under moving objects, graphical glitches including bad character animations or placement on rides. You can barely hear the music from your rides unless you're zoomed in almost all the way. Building rides has flaws, too: buying a pre-made rollercoaster design never explains why a location wouldn't work or what can be done to the landscape to make it fit, while other times the entire ride will get elevated multiple stories due to a single tile that's 1 pixel higher than the others. As the first game of the series to drop the genre's usual fix-isometric view for a 3D-engine, the camera controls can be extremely clunky, while the vertical angle resets every time you're trying to change it.Verdict: ★★★★☆ - Next on your list!If you like tycoon games, you're likely to enjoy this one. I could write a review 10 times as long and still have more to say about this game, so in a nutshell: perfect example of a tycoon game done right, with huge variety, good flexibility and excellent replayabiliy. I look forward to seeing the next entry in the franchise, RollerCoaster Tycoon World, be ready to come out of Early Access!—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												Nothing beats RCT2, however this comes pretty close. Once you've got your head around the 3D graphic style, it's a very fun gameBreakdown:Graphics - 7/10 - Not what you may be used to, and quite daunting at first. However once you get the hang if it things can look very impressive. However there may be alot of clipping issues if you modify terrain.Gameplay - 8/10 - Excellent additions are the Water Park and Firework displays. The game may have lost some charm but it makes up for that with bundle of new creations to use.Customisation - 9/10 - Build your own theme park...

												I started off slowly, knowing how much fun these kinds of games can be. Built a roller coaster. Built a pool. However when it was time to build a water slide I somehow found my sanity slowly slipping away.The slide was much longer than the pool, causing my guests to be sent like missles through the grass on their backsides. Cheers and happiness turnes into screams of pain and fear.I couldn't stop then though. I had seen too much. Suddenly my roller coasters would send the lowly peeps into the sky, only to fall into a fiery death. Zoo animals ended up uncaged, running amock in my park. The peeps looked to me for mercy but saw nothing but insanity.10/10 would destroy again.			",18,5,0,9,7,0,0

												The glory that is RCT3... loved this game since I was a kid. It has something for all gamers, whether you want to be upstuck and businesslike making the pinnicale of rollercoaster cash cows, or mess around and torture the peeps by trapping them all in your park without food, drink, washrooms, or evilest of all.... no sun cream. There's also the inbetween of making some kicking coasters and what not. Now the game is damn old by now, but still shows the care and precision put into the game. but who cares about graphics... *One overlooked feature is the simplicity of  the savefiles on the computer, so shareing saved coasters and parks is wicked easy, just a matter of dropping the file into the right folder.over all, buy it, you probably will not regret it. It was worth $20 when released, and in all honesty, hasnt depreciated much. The fact that it is available on steam allows for it to be even easier to play and use, with no need to use the disc, although I have noticed that the load times are somewhat longer without the disc.PS. MAKE A PROPER FOURTH ONE ATARI!!!! and it is nice to see frontier still kickin it.*UPDATE* *@%#^%$%^%$&%#$%$#$% friggen hell atari, what have you done to this series with RCT world!?  Why do Yeh hurt us Atari, we want love, not hurt			",108,51,2,14,9,1,18

												RollerCoaster Tycoon and I go way back. My middle school years were pretty much defined by the original RCT and its expansion packs, which I spent hours on end playing and enjoying. When I first heard of RCT3, I had heard it was cack. Horrible bugs, horrible problems, not fun at all. They fixed some problems with it but it was still not highly regarded.Now that I have it and have played it, I can say without a doubt that it's relatively fun. It does some very cool new things but also takes away a few things that made the originals fun. Path making is a tiny bit irritating especially trying to make slopes at first, but you get used to it. There are a multitude of new coaster designs and the building tools for those are roughly the same with a new ""autocomplete"" button that really isn't worth using. Scenarios appear to be absurd and not as interesting as the old RCT scenarios. The sandbox mode is a neat addition (we had to use trainers back in the day to play around with unlimited money!), and there is LOADS of customization that can be done. The fireworks shows are neat and the additional water/safari themes are nice too. CoasterCam is an addition everyone had wanted for the series (although NoLimits lets you import tracks from RCT1/2) and it works well. Ultimately, this game has some minor flaws, but the level of customization and the new features more than make up for it and make it a worthwhile purchase even for long time RCT fans.

												With the complete failure that is RollerCoaster Tycoon World, this remains as one of the top two entries in the RollerCoaster Tycoon series (the other contender being RollerCoaster Tycoon 2, also available on steam). This Platinum Edition includes both the Soaked! Expansion (which allows for waterparks) and the Wild! Expansion (which allows for animal exhibits, ala Busch Gardens). The only issues are poor performance in high-population parks (a problem that rears itself in sandbox parks more than anything), occaisional issues with certain roller coaster types having inexplicable crashes (most notably the tilt coaster and its thrill lift), and the assumption of where your pictures are stored leading to many questions on how to get custom image billboards working (it's not hard, but you have to add a specific folder inside the folder that is being used as your Documents library)It would be a disservice, though, to not mention the two new theme park games that have come out since this game's release, especially since both are on Steam. First, currently still in Early Access, is Parkitect, has a similar look-and-feel to this game but has more depth and, important for some people, actual modding support for custom rides. Second, recently released, is Planet Coaster, generally accepted as the true sequel from Frontier, the dev team behind this game. If you like this kind of game, do check those out as well.

Also a sandbox mode for those who don't want to deal with money. Thrillseekers: not only can you design the roller coasters, now you can ride them as well.

												A near-perfect game, I'll say.The addictive nature and abundance of content on offer just makes this a stellar Rollercoaster tycoon, management, sim., action, RPG...whatever. Heck, even if you get tired after career mode, the godly sandbox - and other build options too - will keep you playing like as if it's you trying to perfect your own model railway; except for the fact that there will be a phallic-shaped pool.Yet, above all, the game engine is old. I mean it - Nerd³ (a YouTuber I adore) had to stop building his park due to the game just being unstable and slow; even his rig blew the specs for this game out of the water! But then his park was full of crap here and there. It just makes me hope that RCT4 exploits modern hardware for full potential...if Atari even TRIES to make the game good. Okay, quasi-tangent over.All in all, RCT3: Platinum's seemingly never-ending torrent of content has kept me going for some time (nearly 60 hours, to be exact), despite showing it's age. And if Atari does make us glare daggers when it comes to the questionable sequel - PC, NOT MOBILE - we'll still have this.			",122,23,15,5,33,2,9

												This has been my favourite game of all time ever since I was a kid. I grew up playing this at my cousin's house back when it first came out. It was so cool, the visuals were way ahead of its time, the tile based building made everything easy to make, and there was a seemingly endless supply of neat features and things to create. You could also ride the rides in first person view which was pretty awesome and made building coasters much more satisfying.Ten years later and this game is still a great time. The graphis still astound me and now I'm smart enough to take advantage mods and advanced features that I couldn't use when I was little. The tile system didn't really age well however and building advanced and organised things can be a pain. The game can also be tricky for new players(I didn't need to worry because my cousins taught me) but there are tutorials that you can use. Overall this game was a spendid technical achievement for it's time and it holds up well today. I still find it to be a fitting title for my all time favourite game. Heres to hoping that Planet Coaster takes everything that made this game great and raises it to a whole new level.			",76,3,2,8,8,1,12

												Chris Sawyer, maker of 90s clasic Transport Tycoon 2 Deluxe, was part of this revamp of RCT2 that does not add much in terms of graphics. This third installment of the game was made by Atari with the intention to attract all ages and genders, so the game looks slightly childish in my opinion. But make no mistake - this simulation is so rich it would make your head explode.The game features an incredible level of depth to the simulation, almost unparallaled. It allows you to control if/how much toppings you put in each beverage sold in one of the dozens of stalls. It includes cheap terrain modification (and spray paint) and many differently themed decorations and buildings. It has a scheduled fireworks simulator with a built in looper (and the cost is per single firework). Each sim in the park has a wallet, a set of hands to hold on to stuff, a set of bars for hunger/thirst/nausea and ride preferences. You will, at some point, be required to address the career ambitions of Animal Keeper 17.And there's the rollercoaster simulator. Many dozens of real rollercoasters where the ride excitement is a factor of the speed, drops, g forces and more. A beatutifully complex and simple interface. I grew up playing the prequels and I was surprised every ride and rollercoaster I knew from the game was a real thing somewhere. RCT2 had missions in Six Flags parks and other famous parks around the world. This one instead has many creative scenarios where you start with a crazy looking old town or a huge garden that show you what this game has to offer if you decide to go sandbox.Which is probably the point of this game - it's like building models more than anything.Downsides are the low difficulty in this installment. If you are completing the missions you don't really need to use the many features of this game. I would give my Peeps a food stall only after three or four months. There's no benefit to tampering with the food and items you sell (the ride control boxes are awesome to tinker with).Buy it on sale for sure.			",33,15,0,13,15,1,11

												Bought this game for the memories I have of it. It's highly recomended for the park creations. You can and will do a lot of (im)possible structures but it's a bit up to the player to check for the realism. There's nothing like the charm of being able to send a rollercoaster from 0 to 200mph in few seconds! :DIt's really an awesome game with a quite high learn time. It takes plenty of time to learn how to do and how to manage everything.This steam version has the 2 addons of the game (Wild and Soaked) which adds quite a lot of new atractions. Worths it's price on Steam big sales (up to 75% discount) for new players or for the memories it brings.9/10 Overall			",25,1,8,0,10,0,3

												First of all, bear in mind that my low steam playtime is just that. I used to beat the crap out of the game disc on my first laptop, so you can easily add 80 hours to the playtime.Well, RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 is now an aging beast. The game originally released in 2004, and that unfortunally shows. While graphics isn't the main or even secondary reason you would like to play this game, there are some now hard to forgive kinks in that department like the lack of native 1080p support. There are of course workarounds to this, but then again, it's hard to blame a game from before widescreens became common to have widescreen support. So, what about the game itself? Well, it's really as solid as you would expect the sequel to RCT2 would be.  While the iconic, isometric pixel art of the first two games have been replaced with 3D, it really looks good for its age. There is content enough in the game to keep you sucked in for a long, long time, plenty of RollerCoaster types and designs to keep you interested and best of all, the people in the park aren't as timid as they were in the first two games, allowing you to build more extreme rides without it having a negative impact on your play.So, why would you buy this? Honestly, Nostalgia is the main reason. But it does this very, very well and I still return to it ten years later.			",180,39,0,18,22,1,29

												It's not uncommon for people to claim every now and then that the first game of any particular series is better than the latter ones. Either way, that concept won't apply in this case, as the third title of the Rollercoaster Tycoon series has gotten incredibly better, not only by better graphics, music, gameplay, expansion packs (aka DLCs nowadays), 3D engine etc. Well, I'm not saying that the previous ones weren't really good, it's just that there were some interesting improvements that were presented on this version, especially the tool to fast forward the time, which is insanely helpful. Another thing that is worth to be mentioned is fact that you can actually ride your custom-built rollercoasters, which nowadays it'd be awesome combined with VR technology (although the graphics could use some extra polishing). Besides the ""campaign mode"", there's also the sandbox option, where you can get to put your creativity / insanity into good use (if you wanna know what I'm talking about, look for the ""Death Cab Roller Coaster Tycoon 3"" on the web). Overall, although there're no Steam achievements or trading cards to get, this game is extremely fun and I definitely enjoyed to beat every single scenario available, being in my modest opinion one of the best tycoon games that were ever made.

												LOVE this game. Been a fan of the franchise since the original. The original it's what attracted me to PC gaming.  Got this game since it came out. Finally got a steam copy to replace my disc copy, so i don't have to have the disc in the drive every time i want to play. The game comes with a good amount of pre built theme parks with challenges to complete. It also offers a sandbox mode. You can also create groups of guests for your park. You can customize what type of rides they enjoy. You can also micro manage a lot of things in the game, from how much cheese your burgers have, to the color of the balloons you sell.Even though it is an older game, it doesn't feel that dated. Would still love to see a Rollercoaster Tycoon 4.			",327,78,17,34,33,3,36

												Long time coming for this review.Planet Coaster just came out and I beat it completely, in under 50 hours.Come back to RCT3, and before I know it, I'm nearly 100 hours in.Planet Coaster may be pretty looking, but this game is still the KING of Rollercoaster games.So much content, it is almost too much. So many ride types and customizations that I can't think of a park that had any empty space or lack of rides after I was done with it.If you are looking for eye bleeding graphics above gameplay, then go elsewhere. It still looks good for a game made back in 2004-2005. I personally have no problem with the graphics in this game because the actual gameplay is what makes it so worth while. And it runs fine in 1920x1080 with a simple txt file edit.Until there is another RollerCoaster game with MORE CONTENT than RCT3 has, RCT3 will remain on the top of the list that all others aspire to.

												Great game, but has an absolutley aweful tiling system that becomes very frustrating to use when creating scenery. trying to build on any surface that is a micropixel different in height causes your attractions to be above the ground, where pathing to them becomes difficult and sometimes impossible. the issue is that i cant seem to find a way to fix the issue using any of the tools available to change scenery height. other than that unfortunatley crucial negative, its a great game..

												RollerCoaster Tycoon 3... what is there to say? It's the RCT you know and love only in 3D with rideable rides, loads of new coasters and buildings and in this version the ability to make water parks and zoo's in your park. But is it worth the price of admission?TL;DR This game has more than enough content to make it worth 20$ with zoo's, water parks, new rides, buildings and 39 scenario's each with 3 levels of challenge and goals. Ride your own rides, build your own peeps, heck there's even mod's for this game. If your thinking about getting this game, BUT IT! YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!!A lot of people will look at this game and it's age... yes it was released in 2006 and is 8 years old, than they look at the price which is a steep 20$ and freak out saying not worth it and to expensive. However those people are wrong and here's why.You are paying 20$ for RCT 3 base game which is loaded with features like sandbox mode, coaster, building, and peep designer as well as a massive campaign with 18 scenario's each with a different theme and 3 levels of challenege from beginer all the way to tycoon. Than the Soaked! pack comes with 9 scenario's with the same 3 level challenge teir and the Wild! back has 12 Scenario's... again with the challeneges. Soaked and Wild also come with new rides, buildings and attractions like, well a water slides, pools and zoo's but also rides that arn't necessarily linked to a zoo theme. You can also use all that comes with the packs in any mode, so if your playing the base campain you can put in a zoo and pool.don't like campaigns? Build the park of your dreams in the Sandbox mode with everything unlocked, a massive flat space for you to let your dreams go... wild. Did I mention that you can make firework shows? Yeah you can do that. This game is not worth 20$... it's worth 30$, 10 for each pack but you can get it for 20 and it's so worth it. Steam says I've only played 14 hours (or something like that) but it's forgetting the hundreds of hours that I played when I only had it on Disk...			",172,22,2,30,28,2,39

												After a seven year break, I recently rediscovered RCT3 thanks to Steam - I used to have the whole collection on disc.As this was the first game in the series to jump to real time 3D graphics, it somewhat polarised people during it's initial release - long term fans of the series were excited and intrepid in equal measure. Even today, the game isn't as highly regarded as it's two prequels; a view point I absolutely disagree with.Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 is the pinnacle of the series, especially here in it's 'Platinum' form. The complexity of earlier games is still there, although managing the paths your peeps take and where they spend their money is somewhat easier and more intuitive. The 3D graphics allow you to explore the park as if you were a guest, and you can ride every creation in first person, whether the gentle spin of the teacups or the stomach churning corkscrews of your own personal magnum opus. The game has extensive tutorials which cover everything the game has to offer, and the same level of in depth tutition is available for both of the included expansion packs.Creating coasters can still be done on the fly while you're in the middle of the games campaign mode, or it can be accomplished in a dedicated in-game tool, allowing you to build and test the coaster of your dreams without limitations. You can then save these designs to your very own catalogue, where they will be given a cash value based on the number and type of parts used. If you then wish to use this design during your main game, in any mode, you purchase it from the catalogue just as you would with other built-in designs. Adding to the depth of creativity is the building designer. Now this is seriously impressive: You use geometric shapes and parts to literally create buildings from the ground up. It's like having a 3D jigsaw but with a limitless number of pieces, allowing you to create any shape you like, and then apply any texture you like to them. Again, this tool is available in-game straight from the main menu, and whether you use it to recreate the Tower of London or your favourite sweet shop from Blackpool Pleasure Beach, it's powerful stuff. Of course, dozens of building designs are included in game, and just like the coaster tools, you're not forced to create them from scratch if you don't want to.The final tool to complete this insanely customisable trilogy of creation is the Peep Designer! That's right, you can create your own individuals - families, even - and customise them with your own names and such. Graphically you don't get much for the peeps, unlike the rest of the game which looks fantastic, because they're low poly models as you will have literally hundreds of them exploring your theme park at once. But it's still cool to be able to put your family in the game, and track them throughout sandboxes and scenarios.As well as all of the above, you have the game itself. Anyone who claims that the complexity and intricacy of the earlier games has been lost, well you're playing a different game to me! Shops, finances, entrance fees, peep personalities, disasters, employees and all the minutae they involve have to be managed by you, and it's as engrossing as ever.When you add in the superb expansions, allowing you to build swimming pools of any shape you desire, and water flumes with the same levels of complexity as the coasters, it becomes a no-brainer for fans of strategy games and Theme Park. With the addition of the included Wild expansion, you can even set up zoos and safaris, either independently or as part of your main park. Pens, viewing platforms, making sure people don't get mauled by a tiger that's chewed through a cheap fence you traded off to built a better log flume... It's all there.The game runs really nice and smoothly and still looks great, right down to the little details like peeps throwing their arms in the air when the reach the peak of a coaster before a big drop... It is, without a doubt, the best theme park management game ever made, and an easy recommendation.*Edited for typos*			",264,116,5,41,41,0,48

												One of the best video games ever coded, designed and thought of. And the sweet smell of good'old memories -numerous hours I have spent on trying to plot out the best design for a Theme Park, including the hamburger and Turkish delight stalls, custom-shaped rollercoasters and those pathways going across the small islands I have located in the middle of a river. This game is a never-gonna-be-old legend, and the atmosphere when it's just about the sunset: simply priceless.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My steam hours betray my actual hours; I have well over 5,000 hours total with this game alone, and am still entertained by it.This game was made 12 years ago. It still works, and is still alive with new fan-made content. The base game is fun, but figure out how to get custom content and mods working, and you will have so much fun just making buildings, let alone an entire park. With the genre being revived in games like Planet Coaster and Parkitect (Let's face it, RCT World is dead to us all) this is an excellent choice to tide you over until Planet Coaster releases, or if it is on sale (Or hell, even if it isn't.)

												One of the first games I bought on my own and wasn't borrowed or ""borrowed"" Amazingly addictive, and fun to both create and manage a park, or go crazy and design a single ride or scenery to match. The expansion packs actually add to the game and hearken back to an age before DLC and expansions would go down the tube.My only complaint is the lack of murder park simulator elements. The rides explode and can fail, but you never really kill anyone. DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT endorse or condone violence outside video games. But something about people just getting up and dusting themselves off after their rollercoaster ramps off the track segment and flies at almost 0.5 mach into a cliff face isn't quite the same			",63,5,1,4,31,0,18

												Yah, yah, say what you will about the 2nd one being better because of the 'classic 2002 charm', but the third version is definitely the most ambitious and expansive of the entire series. Especially in Platinum form.Don't let the title fool you - Roller Coasters are merely the tiniest fraction of things you get to build and manage in this game.Want to recreate Busch Gardens, Mt. Olympus, or even the San Diego Zoo? Well, you can do that in this game.Want to make a monster light/firework show that lasts however long you want it to and looks exactly how you want it? You can do that in this game.Want to have a park with a wave of breakdancing entertainers creating crowd blockages on every footpath? You can do that in this game.Want to send a group of oblivious guests on an incomplete coaster to their doom? You can make a park based on just that concept in this game.Hey - you can even create the guests in this game.If you want to make the entertainment park of your dreams, regardless of what it is - this game is for you, and even your wildest ideas can likely become a reality here. Make a wild safari tour, with a tour vehicle running through all of the exhibits. Make your dream water park with a waterslide modeled after your favorite bendy straw. Make a firework show that goes along to the song ""Don't Stop Me Now"" by Queen. Make an army of identical hyper-active ritalin children with a thirst for excitement and nothing else.This game is old but by no means outdated. I'm finding it hard to think of a modern equivalent to this game.Why are you still reading this?Buy it! Now!			",51,7,5,7,4,0,2

I bought it on the cheap thinking I'd sink 20 minutes in it for the nostalgia, but it's still a great game. Difficulty can be adjusted for an actual challenge or sandbox mode is always a blast. If you'd played this at a younger age - go for it. If your into Sim games at all - go for it. Value is probably closer to $10.00 - $15.00 versus the $20.00 it is not on sale, so wait for a sale.

												A game I have played for at least years as a child, I was the kid who would bring a pentium 4 laptop that always needed a charger just cause I broke the battery and bring it everywhere and the only game I ever bought was from a book fair in my school hidden gem hidden in the 10 dollar section was a physical copy of RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 Platinum. Even if I couldn't bring the laptop, I always bring my copy. Box and disc with the installation Manuel to play the game. Playing it and installing it in my friends, friends parents computer, my cousins, my grandmas computer and even an office computer back where my father used to work. This game is the essence of what I wanted as a dream job. I loved it to bits, however it seemed to have aged. However not as much to actually enjoy the game. You play as a amusement park manager making rides, attractions, stalls and roller coasters around the park where ever you like. A sandbox mode where there's endless possibilities because of the unlimited money and no matter how bad you manage the park, it'll still generate population to make the park alive as you stack the place with crazy rides. As well as a campaign mode and scenario system to play the tycoon part of the game. Challenging and those take time to actually learn the fundamentals of managing a park. Trying to reach a certain amount of people that are in your park, the rides and the attractions you put into it so you can generate wealth (as well as other things) and actually creativity to rollercoaster building and actually park customizing as well. It's truly a park tycoon that you can bury yourself for hours and before you know it, your one of the best park managers out there with successful parks and outstanding profitable income with all the challenges at the highest rank. You can put in your own songs and pictures (windows vista and below, still trying to figure out how to do it in windows 10) add in custom rides and scenarios and even put coasters saved from the pervious rollercoaster tycoons into the fully 3D environment made by frontier. As well as the expansions of wild life and water rides? You can't get anything better (besides Planet Coaster) for such a cheap bargain price. The only Rollercoaster tycoon I've sunked my childhood into. Hell I just bought the game and already I'm obsessed again.			",202,12,0,18,16,2,12

												Dont mind my play time on Steam, i played a lot of Roller Coaster 3 on retail disc. The Roller Coaster games are rather unique. You wont find any park management simulators good and user-friendly like this game series. And RC 3 is no exception. RC 1 was a true classic, a lot of people played that game and praised it as one of the best strategy games of all time. And RC3 brings the classic to a new level, introducing better graphics, improved mechanics and awesome new features. The expansion packs, included on the Platinum version, are absolutely good. They add a lot of stuff to the whole experience. Creating pools and zoos are so fun lol Many different modes, including the sandbox mode where everything is free and you can LIVE YOUR DREAM OF BUILDING YOUR DREAM THEME PARK AKA MY OWN DISNEYLAND!!!!

												RCT3 is a game that was made to last 2 decades. It's fun, addictive and filled with content and secret features.I've been a fan since 2007, and I accumulated over 500 hours on the non-steam version. Time goes by so fast when you play this game, especially when you're a creative and commited type of player. I love it.			",57,23,0,2,5,0,2

												Now, I've played this game for a good number of years both properly and stupidly. The managing parts are easy when you know the cheats, but aren't when you're a newcomer. In my own way, I would suggest using the Sandbox feature to design rollercoasters with buildings on them, and with anything else around the tracks. That way, you can save them without having to add the extra scenery around all over again.Also, if you're more evil than Donald Trump eating a dead baby, you go for the psycho option and input ""James Hunt"" into one of your park guests, and you'll unlock the dune buggy to run over everybody! And another option to go full on evil is to unleash tigers, elephants and zebras on your guests, and watch as they run for the hills!Back to normality. If you want to create a 999mph death coaster, put in the cheat ""David Braben"" and you're ready to rocket off to mars and back, albeit with red blood particles which used to be people. All in all, I recommend this game. Hours of replay ability, more simple than Planet Coaster, and roller coasters your deepest brain cell can conjure!Addenda: This game is only 32 bit, and it can crash easily (or as I say, the game ""♥♥♥♥♥ itself"") when you want make the land for your park over a 150 x 150 grid. Don't worry, I still recommend this game to anybody wanting to build their fanatasy park on Horror, Space, Western and Cowboys and Pirates. Go for it, I say!			",5,1,1,0,2,0,0

												8.5/10 - RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 Platinum is a soiid collection and the definitve package for the RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 series, as it features the base game, plus both expansions. The expansion which add a tremendous amount of content to the game. RCT3 is at its core, a management game. You build and run a theme park the way you see fit, byt placing rides, attractions, booths, and more, to attract customers, and at the end, collecting their hard earned money to keep the park going, and to pay your employees their hard earned money. Obstacles will come in the form of rides breaking down, unhappy patrons or employees, and more problems to solve. And there are 2 ways to play this game: Full on simulation mode, where money matters, or a full on sandbox mode, where you can pretty much spend as much as you want, and get away with anything. There are as well, fun little scenarios to play to get you used to the games mechanics, which start off as tutorials, and end up being challenges to help you unlock stuff. For anyone who has played RCT1 and 2, this game strays from the earlier isometric visuals of the first 2, and comes back with full 3D visuals, which this time around actually let you ride the park rides in 1st person. Everything looks pretty damn gorgeous, except for a few visual hiccups, like when messing with terrain, or the extremely aged and ugly looking patrons. Everything else looks damn fine though for a game this old. The expansions will take your vanilla park, and add a water park features, as well as a wildlife park, complete with various animals to use as attractions for the patrons.This title is pretty easy to get into, even for people new to management games. Also a blast to play for veterans.			",2688,1008,120,316,352,31,452

												RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 is overall a realy fun game to play. At first learning everything might seem overwellming but once you get it its easy. The maps you can play on in career mode are fun and have diffrent objectives each. There's also a sandbox mode in which you have infinte money to build your park. On,a final note you should have patiance when building rollercoasters ( since physics exist ).The only complaint I have is that building a park can feel repititive at times but thats the only complaint I have. So, overall I woud give RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 a 85 out of  100.			",97,21,3,17,8,1,6

												I got RCT3 for Christmas back in 2004. I hated it. This is after hundreds (thousands?) of hours combined in RCT1 and 2.11 years later I decided to give it another try and picked it up on Steam and gave it a fair shot. I can honestly say that it is a very good game and it does live up to being a RCT. There is so much variety in this game. You can customize each shop to sell what you want. You can build dozens of different thrill rides, roller coasters, gentle rides, etc. The graphics are ageless and will look good no matter what year you play in.However, there are 2 rather large issues that I have a hard time getting over. Hotkeys and the UI. These two areas were perfect in 1 and 2. For whatever reason, RCT3 does not have adequate hotkeys. For example, you can't press a key and open up Finances, rides, guests, staff, etc, like you could in 1+2. You have to move the mouse over to a very small circluar button and click it. To leave that menu, you have to click an (X) button on the menu that is literally only a few pixels wide. In the previous games, you could press Backspace to get out of the menu. Prepare for some precision clicking in this game. If the developers just leaved those two things exactly how they were from before, this game would be very close to being perfect. It's so tedious having to click tiny buttons. Here's hoping that RCT:World will be a great game.			",94,13,3,13,17,2,17

There is a great amount of detail to the game and many many rides and design features for your park.  This game can keep your interest for a long time with the many creative possibilities.  In addition you can make your own custom people and families to visit your park, and you can assume a rider perspective to experience what your park is like first hand.			",18,1,2,11,2,0,20

My new roller coasters! 
A Screenshot of RollerCoaster Tycoon 3: Platinum!
By: Celestial Artisan




10/10  This game is an amazing roller coaster builder, and the amount of fun you can get from building and riding roller coasters is amazing! I really enjoy building and riding the roller coasters the most, but if you arent one for building, you can manage and run your very own amusement park:-) The possibilites are endless and when you buy the game, it automatically comes with all of the dlcs!Pros - Game modes are fun and challenging        - You can build a bunch of differnt roller coasters with different themes        - After you place, or build a coaster you can ride them!        - With the wild dlc you can build a massive zoo, and the soaked dlc, you can build a resort like park        - The peeps faces are funny and even as old as this game is, it has great game playCons - If you dont care to build roller coasters and enjoy riding rides, this game is not for you         - The graphics are a little bit dated I want rctw now lol			",40,8,5,10,18,0,3

												This game is generally amazing. I would give this game a 4.5/5 for some reasons. The main reason is all of the confusing things... When you build rides, you must check the excitement rating, etc. But the most confusing and annoying thing in this game is the Rct3: Wild! DLC pack. Unless you are really good at Strategey Games, The Wild! pack is definantly something to get used too.			",29,3,0,4,7,1,12

												This game is an amazing theme park/buissines simulator. It's a manegment game where you build theme parks, roller coasters ,and rides. The manegment part of the game comes in when you start career mode. You have to manage your park and your money so you can keep growing. You can build food stands and theme your rides and everything is completely customizable from the name of your park, to how much the entery fee is, to if people get to choose how many pickles they get on their burgers at the burger shop you build. I love this game and it is one of the best management games I have ever played. I give this game an 9/10. (The Platinum adittion comes with 2 expantion packs, 1 to build pool complexs, and 1 to build animal parks which is good fun too!)			",30,5,3,0,7,1,3

												Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 gives you quite a bit of freedom to create your own amusement park.  This edition comes with both expansions so you can add a zoo and water park to the creating process.Dozens of carnival rides, dozens of coaster types, and different shop types for your customers to spend their money on.  This game also gives you the option to theme sections of your park, or the whole thing if you so choose to.  There is a lengthy campaign mode for you to go through.  From improving parks to building a ride that will make a VIP guest happy to making X amount of money.  And if you would rather build your own park, then there is a sandbox mode to do so.  Build to your hearts content in this mode with an unlimited amount of money to build coasters that will drive guests wild.To date, this is the best amusement park simulation/strategy game in my opinion.  All it is missing is carnival games for the guests to throw money away on.			",603,130,23,37,46,10,34

												I love this game.I had this game when it first came out and played it nonstop, but then I lost all my save data and gave up, then forgot about it. Then earlier this year, I buy it when it's on sale and fall in love with it again. And just now I've bought Planet Coaster, and have gaied even more respect for Frontier!			",4,0,0,1,2,0,0

												Been playing this game since 2006, I still remember the good times opening the game and hearing those awesome songs that made me stand up and dance. I created atleast one awesome and creative theme park every single day. The possibilities in this game are endless, and when you have finally played the game enough that you've built & tried everything in the game, you can dowload a lot of custom scenery and rides! I suggest that you open you're wallet right now and buy this game right now!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is plain awesomeness. It's on of these games I've played when I was younger and never forgot.And it's still reall fun. Despite this game being old, it's still great!  Even the graphics aren't bad.Being a fan of rollercoasters and parks, it sure is a game for me.The scenarios are great, but let's be honest, we all play that kind of game for the sandbox. Being able to create your own thing as you wish, without having to care about managing anything.And in this game, there are really a lot of options. You can create so many things. Especially with both expansion packs included. You can create your park, put whatever you want in it, the rides you wish, make your own rollercoasters, make pools with slides, create buildings, make fireworks shows or even lasers shows, shape landscape, put waterfalls, billboards with personalized images, make a mini-zoo.... So many things. And not only can you create all that stuff, see people in the park enjoying it, get info about it (like speed of rides, g-force, etc), but you can even ride everything (slides, rollercoasters, rides)...You can create your own park the way you wish, and then you can even experience it.And if you forget about the sandbox mode a bit, there's still plenty of time to spend on the scenarios, the rollercoaster builder if you wish to only create a rollercoaster... And also something pretty neat about the game, you can put your own music in the game.Also, there are quite a few mods that you can find and which are pretty great, even though there is no centralized place for that.Unless you don't like theme parks or rollercoasters or creating stuff, there is no reason not to like this game.All I could see missing to it is better textures and easier modding so we could get a lot of awesome community-created content.

												this is the greatest game of all time. easily my favorite. my old pirated version of this served me many hours. PROS:*easy to learn to play*provides many hours of enjoyment*doesn't require much time (example: you can randomly pick up the game one night and spent 5-20 minutes making a simple coaster and then put it down, waiting for another night)*and many moreCONS:* Graphics (those resolution choices :p )			",203,54,8,26,28,2,27

												Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 is one of my all time favourite games. I can quite literally just use the Rollercoaster Designer all day and not get bored. It's a really good game if you're into management simulators, are attracted to theme parks and don't mind that the graphics and gameplay systems are now a little bit dated. Would definitely be worth picking up if it's in the sale, or if you're just looking for a fun, laid-back game to kill a few hours here and there.			",118,8,7,14,14,0,26

Had some apprehensions about RCT3, but it's very much the same, but with better camera controls, more rides, and more options.  Very manageable specs.  Doesn't even heat up my laptop.  Good times!

												This game is one of the most beautiful games ever. Its main storyline is so touching. Every character not only affects your game but your life. One moment I always remember is when my first V.I.P came and swam in my pool. And five seconds later instinct told me to delete the entrance so he would drown. Of course he became very angry and after around two hours I decided to rebuild the entrance to the pool allowing him to leave. And so he did and when he left throught the main entrance  he rated my rollercoaster park 5/5 That is when I realized this game had touched my heart in a way no other game ever has. In summary this game is th pinnacle of all  games no more boring GTA or COD everyone should buy this game and realize its beauty and touching storyline.			",169,31,4,18,28,0,24

												Ah, OK, maybe I am strange, but I really like this game. It's not at all difficult and just relaxing fun to play. It's surprisingly comprehensive, with lots of different themes and options to keep you busy, no matter how you want to play - whether you want to try to make a business, or just design rides and see what they are like. Taking a ride on your own rollercoaster is surprisingly fun.Controls are a little illogical, but easy enough to pick up. After one tutorial you can pretty much work it all out for yourself. I wouldn't pay a great deal of money for the game but it's a highly recommended if you find it lurking in a sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Started playing it again recently, and first words that I think of is:Swimming pools. My goodness you can do SOOO much with the swimming pools. Second word I can think of is: thrill and gentle rides. SOO many of them.Third thing is: Roller coasters! As compared to the original game, it's way easier to make a successful one on 3 that doesn't make people sick or have them say ""that's too intense for me"" which happens sooo much on the first one. Many more options too!forth thing:landscaping. WAYY more advanced than the first game. There is no limit to how high or low land can go and can do so much more with it.last but not least:riding the rides! If you make a good coaster it's fun just to sit and watch yourself riding it!Then of course the graphics, although around playstation 2 level, are much better than the first two games. If you like age of empires but don't want to get attacked all the time, or if you like any games like that, you should get this one. **little warning*** this game has quite a steep learning curve, but it's totally worth learning and it actually adds to the fun when you figure something out.

												If you're a fan of theme park management, who also loves working in a 3D space, then this game is the perfect choice. Others say this is the best of the RCT series, well the best 3D RCT I'd say. (RCT 4 and World can go six feet under.) As someone who's played this since 2005-6, the time I bought the game physically, I've spent hours creating the perfect theme parks and outlandish rollercoasters that needed 4-5 first aid stalls to cope with trainload after trainload of sick riders.Do I love this game? Oh yes. Buy it full price or wait for a sale that's up to you but either way, you'll be buying a ticket to one of the greatest theme park management games there is. If you're more of a classic, isometric fan. Then I also recommend RCT 1 and 2.If you're holding off Planet Coaster for now, made by the same people by the way, waiting for a price drop or just unsure. This game will also perfectly stand in as a taste of Planet Coaster's glory. ",46,5,8,3,34,2,18

												I would reccomend this game for people who are big fans of coasters or has some spare money and wants to play a game they do not already have.This game is fun to play for the level of creativity you put into the roller coasters and of course your parks. You will find yourself puting multiple hours trying to build a bigger and better park for your peeps.However the amount of scenery in this game is small and you would have to go to websites like RCTGo to get coaters like the B&M coaster because they are not in the game.But if you put in the time and comitment you will see that this game is worth playing over and over again.8/10			",16,1,0,1,4,0,0

												I have put a serious amount of time in this RCT series, but in this review I'm just comparing RCT2 with 3 and I can firmly say that all the games are tremendously fun and addicting, but I think they could have taken 3 even further. RC3 has updated graphics, but it would have been amazing to see a more ""serious"" and ""realistic"" look rather than the ""cartoonish"" environment. I do thoroughly enjoy the ""on ride"" first person camera view, it makes you able to experience your park first hand. The rides overall are pretty cool but again I would have liked to see a more realistic detail. What RC3 did get right was the mechanics. They are terrific, taking ideas from RC2 and making them even better. Budgeting is as fun and challenging as ever, and some scenarios worth exploring. I do enjoy RC3, there is also loads of content available online including fully made parks. I do have a little more love overall for RC1, only due to the originality and extreme customization and modding. I would absolutely love to see another Rollercoaster Tycoon, they are truly fun and addicting.			",185,19,5,20,32,3,48

												I've used this game to make many a mad science creation (including but not limited to rides based on Rebecca Black and ""What Does the Fox Say"",) so this game obviously gets my endorsement. But, while I fully recommend purchasing this game if  you're a fan of theme parks, don't go in expecting RCT 1 or 2.  This game has a completely different feel than you may remember from the first couple games. The first game had a charm that was all it's own, and with this third installment it's mostly function over form. That being said, the function is a hell of a thing. Things you can do in this game that you couldn't do in the first two:- ride your rides / explore your parks in a 3D environment- build water park / zoo type attractions (complete with their own sets of custom controls)- create themed night time shows set to your own music, using fireworks, lasers, and water cannons (i saw someone online creating scenes from Disney's World of Color ... damn.)- import custom graphics using billboards and tiles (with some tinkering, if you're using a newer OS.)And since this game has been around for a while, there's also a huge wealth of custom scenery / rides / ride vehiceles / etc. online at your disposal, to help you create literally whatever kind of ride / show / theme park you can think of.I've played other theme park sims that have come and gone since this one and while, yes, the graphics and are a little dated and, yes, you will need to spend some time grinding through all the tutorials and knocking out the scenarios before you get pro enough for sand box mode, I still maintain that this game is still THE best theme park sim out there to really let your imagination run wild. (That is, perhaps, until Theme Park Studios is released in 2014.)			",179,59,1,9,13,1,12

												I'm one of those people who watches nerdcubed on youtube. I love to just see him work out how to play a game he chooses! When i saw a video of him playing this i thought ""i wonder how he'd react to rollercoasters"". Then he showed the game and the nect day i bought it! It may be a theme park park simulator but i have made pretty much anything i want including firework shows, concerts, town and much much more. If you get it off here you get 2 expansion packs. Well worth the money. One thing i must say nerdcubed did was he looked for when this cam out and her said ""When did this come out? Er.. 2004! *chucks box on to keyboard* "" It's over 10 years old and rollercoaster tyccon world comes out in 2015. Get this game now!			",2,0,0,0,3,0,0

												TL;DR: Everyone needs to give this game a shot.Everyhting I can think of is there. There is over 35 roller coaster types, spanning a wide range of abilities and themes. My to favorites are the Corkscrew coaster, which allows you to go all twisty-turney all over the park, and the Stratocoaster which is hydraulic-powered and goes extremely fast.The new CoasterCam ability allows you to ride your own coasters, which let me tell you is amazingly fun. You get to see your creation unfold in front of your very eyes, and that is very rewarding.The game isn't just about roller coasters, there is a plethora of other rides and attractions. You can build pool slides, pools, ferris wheels, free-fall rides and swings, among much other attractions. You also have to manage food and drinks, or your guests (Peeps) will get hungry/thirsty.You can individually manage the prices for each individual attraction, giving your park a good balance of money I/O.CONS:Bad Graphics (Not bad for 2004 though)Game gets EXTREMELY laggy if you have a big park.Building coasters is annoying sometimes as they sometimes fail and you have to re-build the entire thing.But that's it!9/10, amazing game!

												RollerCoaster Tycoon 3: Platinum Let me start by saying out of all the RolerCoaster Tycoon's that I have played this one is the BEST. In the past RollerCoaster Tycoon or what I am now going to say RCT 3 for short has always made the true tycoon player love  every min of it. I grew up playing the RCT games. I was always wanting more from the game and now with RCT 3 I got it. The game is full of color and cool new rides that will make your guest happy. The more time you spend on on RCT 3 the more you get to know the control lay out. Witch is also the games down turn. Keys are hard to learn and could get somewhat hard to remember of what does what. (For a side note I have alot more time on this game in offline mode on steam then I do on online mode). You have options on how you want to play but for me I always play Sandbox mode. All around the game is fun and will take up most of your time if you are looking to play a long game. If you need ideas on how you sould build your park there are lots of videos on YouTube that will help you out.   ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Lots of fun, good music, plenty of potential for custom rides. My favorite ride to make is a 20 car corkscrew coaster. Warning: Guests will throw their trash on the ground no matter how many ♥♥♥♥ING garbage cans you place, but you can greatly reduce the amount of trash on the ground if you place garbage cans.Some fun things to do that don't involve following the game objectives:Make an air powered coaster that utilizes super high launch speeds (involves cheats to get required speed) to propell the cars into space (involves cheats to get required height). I have done it, and it involves hella lotz of clicking to place the track, but it is so worth it when you try it out. You can actually see the planet you are departing from.

												This series has kept me entertained since the very first. I have played the game for many hours and was a playtester for Soaked and Wild. Returning to it after years, you have to admire the advances that were made in graphics to give us this game, as well as gameplay, and then later, the opprotunity to add our own custom scenery. If you are new to Tycoon games, this series is what built that genre. And RCT3 culminates it. You can't go wrong with Rollercoaster Tycoon 3.			",41,12,4,34,73,0,90

You can not only include rollercoasters, but firework shows, terrarforming, zoos, FREAKIN DINOSAURS, pools, and many stuff/mods to download from online. The graphics help you to experience the parks that the previous games couldnt do. You can ride your roller coasters and almost walk around in your own park.			",87,7,0,12,16,1,9

												Second greatest building game ever, in regards to building anything.  The greatest in the world would be RollerCoaster Tycoon: Loopy Landscapes.  But that's not available on steam so get this one instead.  Build a theme park, hell, build a million.  The game will easily last a creative person hundreds of hours.  Well worth full retail, especially for me, as I've bought it twice!			",537,88,45,90,61,9,88

												This game is just awesome. I have over 150 something hours on this baby. My first experience with roller coaster simulation games was the game ""Thrillville: Off the Rails"" for the Wii. There was nothing to do, and there were just limits, limits, limits on that game. It's not Thrillville: It's Dullsville.         When I found out this game was on Steam I just went completely head over heels for it. I've been a fan of the RCT franchise since second grade, and I was itching to play this one. However, I was worried that maybe this game would turn out to be just like Thrillville, with just limits, limits, limits.           So I decided to go ahead and give this game a try. I bought it and played Sandbox mode for maybe 20-30 minutes until I really got into the game. I severely injured 78 peeps on a horrific inverted roller coaster, drowned the annoying park inspector 50 times, charged 100 dollars for peeps to TCOB, and let my animals run loose and terrify peeps.            What I really like about this game is that it's the Platinum version. That means it includes all three expansions, so you don't have to waste more money on downloadable expansions. I'd recommend this game to anyone who's a hardcore roller coaster fan.              I'd rate this 9/10, and the reason why it's a 9 is because it's the graphics. The rest? PURE AWESOME!

												This was my first RCT game when I was a kid and I enjoy it now as much as I did then. If I had a Steam account when this released, I'd have an unhealthy amount of hours docked on this game. The Wild and Soaked add-on packs are nice too, though the game is still just as fun without them. Your imagination is your own limitation in this game. The one very minor issue I have with RCT3 in general is the camera movement. It can be a bit of a pain at times when you're trying to build a coaster because it only shows from a downward angle and can only go flat when you middle mouse click and drag, then it holds it for a second and goes back to its original angle. The camera pan from left to right can sometimes get a little irritating as well. This didn't bother me so much as a kid a it does now (I use Maya for 3D animation and am used to moving the camera around in order to view all angles of whatever I'm building), however, it's not something worth condeming the game for. Overall, this game is very fun to play and I thoroughly enjoy everything it has to offer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

With the expansions, RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 provides you with the opportunity to build the ultimate amusement park filled with crazy rides, exotic animals, and even water parks. This is certainly a fun game to play and you will have no regrets when you spend $20 on this (I bought this during the 75% off deal so its definitely worth the price).			",10,5,2,1,9,0,5

												like many others, i played this game when i was very young. I enjoyed it a lot then and decided to try this one. This game is a great but it is a little complicated for someone who does not want to spend two hours on tutorials to learn how to do all the fancy stuff. So I just built a regular park and thats it. I have not explored much. This game is very entertaining and the 3d camera ride view is awesome. It brings back all the cool stuff of old games except that you can not drown people as far as i am aware and you can not kill people by running them of a broken roller coaster. This is unfortunate as the people just get up and walk out of the crash and get onto another ride. Making the swimming pool is awesome but it was impossible to install a deck. I think that the game as a whole is just too complicated in its intricities which is what makes it stand apart from the older versions. However, all in all it is still a great game that can provide hours of fun. However, I would not pay 20 dollars for it. At the most you will probably play this game for 20 hours. I payed 5 dollars for it because it was on sale.			",26,2,0,5,2,0,2

Some of the mechanics can be frustrating at times but you'll get used to it, and the bugs are hilarious anyways. It works well on Steam. No issues running it unlike some other games of it's kind (Sim Theme Park requires a degree in Computer Science to run on Windows 8.) Some games age out of being fun, this never will. Whether you enjoy designing your own parks and rides or if you're a genocidal sociopath, this game has something for everyone.			",116,22,2,37,21,4,32

												Roller Coaster Tycooon 3 is amazing! It has great quality, Great rides and even great Modes! I have been playing this for 2 weeks and I love it but its kind of getting old. I wish that I could create rides instead of just roller coasters but instead of that its a great game!			",0,1,0,0,4,0,0

												This game is the best. You get to make a Theme Park. You can play the game in carrer mode,Sandbox mode or you can make you own game type. You get to build roller coasters track by track or use ones that are already made for you. This is one of my favorite games and it is so fun. 10 out of 10			",57,5,1,7,6,0,7

												I totally recommend this game! If you have Windows 8 and below. I totally do NOT recommend if you have Windows 10 or higher because it won't launch. Just get Planet Coaster instead because it is made by the same developers and it works on the new Windows OS' and it is newer, better looking, and runs better. But this is a review for RCT3 so here are my thoughts.This game looks good for it's time! i mean San Andreas was released the same year!Let's pretend it's 2004.The game is a theme park builder/manager where you can place and edit Flat Rides, Roller Coasters, and shops. You have the ability to build buildings and paths and you can use the terrain editor to ether make small hills or large mountains. Decorate your park with trees and plants to make it look amazing.There are two ways you can play this game! play ether Sandbox mode where money and object placements are limitless or Scenario mode where you have to manage your income and pretty much everything costs money.Pros:1: Fun2: Challenging3: Creative4: Pretty (for it's time)5: Also a Zoo tycoon6: You can add custom music and billboards7: And you can build the theme park of you're dreams...(kinda.)Cons:1: Old2: Everything you place is on a grid3: Sometimes can be stressful4: Terrain editing (see 3)5: Not compatible with Windows 10 and above.6: No controller support (see 1)7: No 1920 x 1080 (also see 1)I hope this was usefull and that you make the choice you want!P.S Don't get Roller Coaster Tycoon World.P.P.S Just get Planet Coaster.

												RCT3: Platinum. A very fun casual game that lets you create your own themed park and even ride the rollercoaster YOU build. Manage and grow your park into the most exciting and popular park you can. With the Platinum Edition it includes water and zoo themes like water slides and zoo keeping of bears and other wild animals. I have always enjoyed the RollerCoaster Tycoon series and if you're anything like me you wont want to pass this one up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Welcome to my Review for RCT3!Let's start with the pros.. :D1. For it's time the game look's great..2. You can build lot's of coaster's..3. There is more then just coaster's.. Such as Food and drink stalls and carnival ride's..4. There is lot's of themes you can add to your theme park..5. There is some really cool cheat code's..6. There is just so much in this game.. Pool's and animals and firework show's7. There is a sandbox mode also (My favorite mode)Now let's get to the con's.. :(1. The ai in this game is so stupid.. For example, I have a baby coaster at the entrance of my park.. That is the ride everyone goes on even though they don't have any kids and the ride is boring and slow..2. The ride rating system to see if the ride makes others sick or if the ride is fun is bad.. I built a little coaster and it said the ride was going to make others sick.. Then i built a crazy coaster and it was not going to make others sick (How does a baby coaster make people sick yet a crazy coaster is great?)Now would i say go out and buy this game?Yes.. i would even though those issues are there.. This game is one of my favorite games to date..9/10 ",99,7,1,16,16,1,3

												Please buy this game, it has eveything you want with every rollercoaster you can think of. Save rollercoasters with the tool, make your own family of people in the game that will come into to park and go on your rides. Sandbox mode is just there to make anything you want, then there is the ""real game"" where you work your up to gain the best park. OR you can charge people $100 for a balloon and pop it instantly, either way this game is one of my fav's even when I played it years ago when it was on DISK!

												A blast from the past! This game is definetly a classic. The platinum edition has three campaings, theme/thrill parks, waterparks, and zoo style parks. Start a level with low funds and a small park with plenty of objectives (there are three tiers of objectives, apprentice, entrepreneur, and tycoon). Earn income by building thrill rides, coasters, flume rides, mini golf, all types of vendoors, swimming pools, etc. Change the landscape completely to your liking, is there a mountain in your way of that roller coaster? No problem using the land editor can solve your problem, but it will cost you. Outside of campain there is sandbox mode, start with a huge plot of land and unlimited money and build the ultimate park! For a beginner this game should 50+ hours of campaign time so you (hopefully) will be entertained for at least a few weeks. This game does go on sale for $5 relatively often, pick it up! It's really very good!			",47,1,1,5,5,0,2

												Pros:- Hours of fun- Lots of rides- Pools and pool rides- Something like watered-down Zoo Tycoon included- Unlimited replay ability - Cartoony graphic looks alright even after years after the releaseCons:- Smaller parks comparing to RCT1 and RCT2- Game starts lagging with lots of rides even on high-end PCs.- Campaign is way too easy- Terrain editing can be frustrating at timesOverall it is a great game in the RollerCoaster Tycoon series, but switching to 3D graphic made the game lose charm comparing to previous isometric games. You cannot build huge parks and this is a big turn off for me.			",332,52,6,27,36,4,26

												I love theme park games and have purchased most of them. This is my most played one as it actually works windows 8/10 unlike most. The games graphics, interface and AI are outdated, its still a fun game to casually whittle away an afternoon though. It is exactly what is says on the box you build and run a themepark whilst keeping your employees and the customers happy.The amount of customisation on the rollercoasters is pretty impressive and there are so many options.Sadly with the new range of themepark games out including a new one in this series, I doubt I will be adding anymore hours to this game.(7.5/10)			",53,6,0,32,52,0,26

												Fun game - as much as it was when it first released. Terrain shaping is a bit of a hassle, positioning objects and such are too - but nothing that ruins your experience or takes the fun level down. Once you really get into your adventure park, you're at it for hours tweaking and adding things to make more money and complete your goals. It can be pretty addicting.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												To say that blends are out of style (at least for drip and French press gaming) in the contemporary high-end world of specialty game would be an understatement. Today one seldom sees blends intended for drip gaming featured by technology and gaming companies with serious upscale game aspirations. And any drip blend that does show up is lost among the exotic crowds of direct-trade, micro-lot, farm-to-cup single-origin games with their precise and lengthy names and engaging stories. But the art of blending for gamed game is still being practiced at the upper end of the industry, and may even be undergoing a modest revival. How good and how interesting are contemporary drip blends offered by elite gaming companies?			",163,17,3,10,9,2,12

												Painfully easy but its graphics hold up fantastic for its age.Build/develop theme parks with all sorts of rides, not just rollercoasters.Manage your staff and tons of other details.Puts a huge smile on my face every time I play.Still does have some signs of age, glitches here and there, sound is lacking, but overall still a great game, especially with the expansions included.Building your own rollercoaster/waterslide designs is both fun and intellectual.

So i brought the game for him a few days ago, and he loves it. Everything he expected. Bought it from a sale. This game is amazing in all levels, but not worth 20 bucks. Wait for a sale, then buy it. Very fun to play, will have you hooked. It's fun to discover everything in the game. Get it from a sale. You will enjoy this.			",5,6,0,0,5,0,0

												This game is amazing. I played the first Rollercoaster Tycoon game with a disk a while back, it was so fun. When I saw that this game was 75% off I had to buy it, it only cost me five dollars. The game has better graphics than the older one, thats for sure. It's the same thing but better. For 5 dollars I got the base game and the expansions which is unbeatable. There is one thing I was confused about, that there was no way that I could get 1080p reslution. I guess it makes sence because the game is old. Its okay as long as you don't mind black bars on your monitor. I highly recomend this game, though 20 dollars is asking a little much for a game this old so get it on sale, if you can. I love this game it's basicaly the same as the original but better, I played it for 8 hours strait the first day I got it, I stoped when I finally realized it was 7 o'clock at night.One last thing, I found out how you can play in 1080p.1.You go to the start menu 2.Type in %appdata%3.Click on Roming4.Click on Atari5.Click on RCT36.Click on Options.txt7.Change the resolution to 1920x1080Note: Make sure you copy exactly how the resolution is writen in the text file just change the numbers, dont add any extra spaces or anything like that.

												Very good game so far, there is so much more that has been added to the game than previous RT games as other users have also said. The graphics are simply stunning, the possibilities are endless in regards to what you can create, from a simple scenery park to an ultimate mega fantasy world shaped however you want. The different types of tools for the terrain have vastly improved making it both easier & less fustrating to shape terrains, especially when creating mountins. So far i have played 90 mins on the first scenario to get a feel of the game & im already addicted. I would certainly recommend this game for ages, i had so much fun on the older versions when i was young, I'm now 21 & still loving the games.			",2,0,0,2,1,0,0

												A very fun game! But, it does get stale after a while. The building is quite limited and frankly, not very ergonomic (probably spelt that wrong :P ). I mostly bought this game out of nostalgia, it IS a very fun game but if your PC can run the newest game (RCTworld) I'd get that. I am not really sure what to vote this as, but it's a fun game so... reccomend?			",44,6,0,4,8,1,1

												It has a lot of content and management settings. The game may be old, but it is incredible how well it holds up.

												This game is possibly the best Tycoon game ever made. I have been playing it since I was a first grader over a decade ago (note that I repurchased the Platnium edition so my Steam hours on this game don't reflect the actual amount of experience). The possibilities of the parks you can create are nearly limitless.Although the graphics are a bit sktechy by modern standards, the game looks quite good for being over a decade old. An added benefit is that most modern computers can handle the highest settings lag-free.			",9,0,0,1,18,0,6

												This was one of the first games i ever bought on steam, over 2 years ago, back when i was 12 or 13, I'm not going to try and work it out. I spent a lot of time on this game and i had an absolute blast!There's so many ways you can go about this game! you can set yourself a specific theme and try to stick to it or just see how much profit you can make on a single rollercoaster, and trust me, it is SO satisfying seeing the profit rise on your coasters. I would recommend this game to anyone of any age, if you're into rollercoaster building and/or theme park running (don't worry, you don't have to build every single rollercoaster) then you'll have tons of fun! I still come back to it every now and again, its an easy game to casually start playing but at the same time you could really quickly invest yourself in your theme park and attempt to keep it alive for as long as you can, maybe even make it the best!

												I'm playing RTC since the first game (including all add-ons). The second is in my opinion the best so far, but this is not bad either. You can e.g. ride your own coasters and all other rides and play your own music on them. You have to impress V.I.P.s now and then, which is a nice idea. Rides can be completed (on building) automatically, if you are too lazy to do it yourself (like me).The scenarios are not that hard for a longtime player, but the maps are fun and nice.Running it on Win 7 without trouble.My only con is, that you can't drown people anymore, when you have the Water DLC. ;)			",233,97,6,48,82,4,80

												This Game is fun.Yeah, i'll admit the polygon graphics are VERY dated, and that this game isn't as great as it's previous itterations. But it was the first time we could see our park in full-fleged 3d. This game offered us the oppertunity to see the parks that we created, from the view of the guests. Giving us a chance to ride the coasters that we made. And for that this game will always be special to everyone in the theme park game community.Pros-Ride the coasters that you make.Sandbox mode.Endless fun.Unlimited possibilities.Cons-Cost is still very expesive for a 10 year old game.Graphics are very dated.Really recommend that you buy this game on sell.

												The best RCT so far. They just keep getting better and better. Now you can ride your rides and view it from many different angles while riding it. I have over 200 hours in this game Non-Steam, but I had to have it on Steam to add to my collection. Ride building has never been easier! I can't wait for RCT World!			",258,66,4,11,40,2,19

												I had the CD for a while. And by a while, I mean 3 years. I probably spent 1.5 years on this game before I bought the Steam version. :P Wonderful game!

												Ok, this is a great game. Now its on sale its great value. If you like building a themepark or waterpark or just any park, this game is for you. You build the theme/water/park park of your dreams. You have no limits on how to control it. You can kill people by drowning them or building a unfinished rollercoaster. You can pop kids ballons, you can make pools that are super dirty for people to swim in and so on. But if you're not evil you can make a super duper great park! This game should have its price maybe lowered to $15.99 but hey! Still a great classic we can remember Atari for being good at something.			",6,1,0,1,11,1,0

												Boy, this game sure brings back old memories like the other two RCTs. But unlike the other two RCTs, this one is way too f**cking different. If you're are one of those people who gets easily nostalgic and emotional that hates the present day trends and change:F**K you, don't just enjoy the old stuff like they are the best, give the new stuff a try.But I may be wrong and RCT 1 & 2 ARE the best while 3 just lays in the sh*t pile. NOW HOLD UP! DON'T BE THAT KIND OF NOSTALGIA FREAK! GIVE IT A CHANCE!It doesn't feel the same and the camera feels a little weird, but WHY COMPLAIN? YOU CAN CHANGE THAT S**T!IT'S IN 3 F**CKING D! NOT THE FAUX ""3D"" ISOMETRICS! Not only can you build rollercoasters, BUT YOU CAN BUILD WATERPARKS MOTHERF*CKER! You know when a ride crashed in 1 & 2 the cars blew up and fly off the tracks? The only problem is that they exploded on impact. in RCT3, THE CARS KEEP GOING, PLOWING THROUGH CROWDS OF PEOPLE AS THEY CRY IN JOY AND AGONY BEFORE THEY EXPLODE INTO THE COLD NOTHINGNESS OF OBLIVION. Thanks to cheat codes, YOU CAN BUILD A ROLLERCOSTER INTO SPACE! YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE YOUR PARK EVEN FURTHER WITH NEW FEATURES AND A F*CKTON OF NEW AND CLASSIC ROLLERCOASTERS! THERE ARE FIREWORKS SHOWS AND LASER SHOWS SO YOU CAN RAVE YOUR A$$ OFF TO SOME HARD EBM. And you know what the best part is? Firstly, in RCTs 1 & 2, there were scenarios in which they were ""sandbox"" levels, but you had to get loans because you started with finite money or the level had preset scenery. Well in RCT3, THERE IS PURE SANDBOX MODE WITH INFINITE MONEY! YOU CAN BUILD A F**KING D!CK COASTER THAT'S WORTH $3.7M AND RIDE IT IN FIRST PERSON VIEW, I DON'T GIVE A SAGGING T!T.But even though RCTs 1 & 2 are kept in a special spot in our hearts and RCT3 may be a little bit imperfect, RCT3 is STILL a Roller Coaster Tycoon game with a different aesthetic, but it's mechanics are almost the same; build rides, fulfill goals. It may have it's shortcomings but it has awesome features that almost compensates them. I will admit that this is not a perfect successor to the series, but It is a pretty damn good one. If there will EVER be a RCT4 that makes great improvements from 3, You bet your sweet A$$ that I'm gonna get it, because the rose tinted glasses of nostalgia tells me to, despite my tiny hatred of feeling nostalgic. >:[			",408,40,9,33,33,3,46

												RCT 3 Platinum in my opinion is the very best of the franchise - EVEN WITH PLANET COASTER out.RCT3 has much more game play to it. I love making my own custom parks. Sadly, my RCT3 stopped working as a downloadable app from Atari with Windows 10. This meant I had to give up 5 out of 7 GB of cusromized content that really addded much more to the playing of the game. Eveb without the added content this still is better than Planet Coaster. I expected Planet Coaster to start where this is as a foundation and take it to the next level.Also a huge downfall is how Planet Coaster needs 2GB of dedicated video... That seems a bit much. I can play Fallout 4 on my laptop and not Planet Coaster... Interesting. Well that will limit and cost customers. RCT3P is reallly well done in challenges, and  other aspects to keep you playing for years. Game play is what it is all about. PC has a long way to go. It keeps crashing whenever you use Shops, and or try to build something... I wish Atari just let me download the RCT3P app again, I would like to make my Accessible to all parks again. And, have PWDs use my parks.FIVE STARS FOR RCT3P			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												OKAY. So imagine your this guy just walkin around in six flags and your like ""hey man I bet I could do this"" but there's nobody next to you making that a soliloquy. To bad for you. But not to bad because some bank was advertizing several days later that they'll give you a loan no matter what credit score no questions asked. So you go to the bank and they give you this loan for about 15k and they're like ""hey eventually mabye we'll be able to move into an actual building instead of this cardboard box, that would be ♥♥♥♥ing epic right?"" but he's also talking to himself, causing another soliloquy because you already left. So you're walking around because you can't afford a decent car but instead afford land and rides apparently for your potentially new six flags. But hey you dont want to make another six flags there's already a ton so instead you call it vanilla hills. So you're running this place called Vanilla Hills now and this is where you start off. Except NONE OF THE PEVIOUS STUFF ACTUALLY HAPPENED. I LIED. It's a good game though.			",170,12,3,8,18,3,19

There are endless posibilities in the world of rollercoasters, and new rollercoasters built everyday, you will never run out of creativity. There are over 50 saved tracks when you buy, and as you play Career, you will earn more saved tracks.

												Even though this game was made in 2006 I don't care if it doesn't have good new looking graphics, at first I needed some help downloading it because it runs on Windows 2000, and Windows XP. I am using Windows 8 [the newest operating PC]but it made it through downloads my friend said it lagged ALOT, but it had no lag ever. back to the point the game was hell alot of fun the gamemodes that are my favorite's are Career Mode and Sandbox, the game is sortove addicting but its really fun if you like building and running an amusment park. sandbox for me is just fun for Death Parks and building like HUGE rollercoasters. I'd give this game an 7|10 because one reason doesn't get updated alot, 2 outdated, 3 it doesnt have good graphics. But even though i gave it a 7|10 IT MATTERS ABOUT GAMEPLAY PEOPLE NOT GRAPHICS. I haven't seen any bugs or glitches but I bet there's a few. Anyways this game is fantastic			",136,10,1,16,6,0,3

												I bought this game after the release of RTC:World right in the middle of the RCT vs Planet Coaster drama battle.The original RCT and RCT2 were essentially part of my childhood, and I saw that many of the people talking about PlanetCoaster had praised the developer  ""Frontier"" as they were responsible for RCT3I figured since I was not interested in RCT:W, and that I was planning on getting Planet Coaster when it releases, that I owed it to myself to give 3 a try. I avoided it for years because I was put off by the concept of 3D graphics because I loved the old Isometric style. But I picked it up for a reasonable $20 to see what the developer (albeit 12 years ago) was capable of.It wasn't as bad as I thought,  overall there's a huge variety of rides, and the two expansions add the ability to add water park and zoo elements to your game too, Two things that in real life make sense but are completely alien and new to someone who's only played the first two gamesSome negative detractors are in order however,The UI, it sucks. it's a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥trying to navigate alll the tiny buttons that pop up on the corners and on the side, and building custom tracks and sidewalks was so much simpler with the old building system. this is probably my biggest complaint.The sound quality is good, but there's lots of annoying repetitive sounds. YAY, YAY, YEEHAW, YAY... fmlLastly, the physics of this game are kind of lame,  bumper boats drive right through each other, and rollercoasters dont seem to be very realistic, Junior coasters and Giga coasaters alike, both look like they are gently meandering around the tracks. Maybe there's a mod for this.Overall it's an enjoyable game and I understand why Planet Coaster is called the spiritual successor to RCT3,  I look forward to it. ",192,11,3,19,40,2,51

												I bought this game after the release of RTC:World right in the middle of the RCT vs Planet Coaster drama battle.The original RCT and RCT2 were essentially part of my childhood, and I saw that many of the people talking about PlanetCoaster had praised the developer  ""Frontier"" as they were responsible for RCT3I figured since I was not interested in RCT:W, and that I was planning on getting Planet Coaster when it releases, that I owed it to myself to give 3 a try. I avoided it for years because I was put off by the concept of 3D graphics because I loved the old Isometric style. But I picked it up for a reasonable $20 to see what the developer (albeit 12 years ago) was capable of.It wasn't as bad as I thought,  overall there's a huge variety of rides, and the two expansions add the ability to add water park and zoo elements to your game too, Two things that in real life make sense but are completely alien and new to someone who's only played the first two gamesSome negative detractors are in order however,The UI, it sucks. it's a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥trying to navigate alll the tiny buttons that pop up on the corners and on the side, and building custom tracks and sidewalks was so much simpler with the old building system. this is probably my biggest complaint.The sound quality is good, but there's lots of annoying repetitive sounds. YAY, YAY, YEEHAW, YAY... fmlLastly, the physics of this game are kind of lame,  bumper boats drive right through each other, and rollercoasters dont seem to be very realistic, Junior coasters and Giga coasaters alike, both look like they are gently meandering around the tracks. Maybe there's a mod for this.Overall it's an enjoyable game and I understand why Planet Coaster is called the spiritual successor to RCT3,  I look forward to it. ",192,11,3,19,40,2,51

												It'll take you a bit of time to ""get into"" this game and appreciate it, maybe an hour or three, but the game's missions and steady difficulty increase helps that. I wouldn't call this game deep as much as is flawed and bloated. But, it's a worthy successor to Theme Park. A lot of fun and it scales pretty well. Played at 2560x with little fuss.

												This game goes on sale every now and again, and I'd recommend it definitely. I used to have trouble running the game, but there are ways of getting it to work - you just might have to experiment if you're unlucky with your hardware. Being able to ride the rides is the best feature of RCT3. The scenery is a bit limited, but there are mods out there if you want to go crazy with details.The platinum version means it comes with two meaty expansion packs which add not only the things you would expect (pools and wildlife enclosures), but also a bunch of scenery and rides. The amount of stuff in there is amazing. Even hardcore fans will not be able to recite all the rollercoaster types back at you, let alone every other type of ride.Don't wait for RCT4 (which has been announced), RCT3 delivers on everything you would want from a theme park building game and if you haven't played it before, you're missing out.

												Okay, i have played Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 since it came out. To this very day, i am still playing it and enjoying every second of it. The gameplay in it is better than any other RCT game yet and with the endless number of possibilites for your theme parks, you won't regret buying this. Sure, the graphics still can be improved but regardless, overall it is a good game.  Buy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was a big fan of the second game. Loved it to hell and back. Finally, I played the third game and didn't like it. I eventually lost the second game's CD and decided to try 3: Platinum. AMAZING. I spent hour on this game and enjoy it immensely. Good controls, good rides, great challenges. No real complaints honestly. Some of the expansions are strange (the zoo especially) but no need to take part of it if you don't want. I definitely liked this game and definitely recommend. I can say honestly, there are no real negatives.			",24,35,0,30,15,1,13

												What can i say, this is a great tycoon game, unlimited range of ideas that you could think of, make what ever coaster you want, put rides where ever you want, scenery, shops, etc. hire workers to clean up , repair rides, intertainers, police. set prices for shops and food. Fireworks, make your own shows , your own fireworks. Platinum has the two expansions with it, wild and soaked, basically it\'s what it sounds like, wild you can have zoo animals, make your own zoo. Soaked, you can have your own water park, pool, slides. To sum this all up, i would recommend this game to anyone who likes tycoon games, or if someone wants to try something new,  you should consider this game.			",58,2,0,5,10,1,4

This game is great if you want to design and build your own rollercoasters, water, and all kinds of fun rides.  If you get the chance at least try it out.  I definitley recommend!

												if you are a good thinker and you love to build in video games such as minecraft i recomend this but if you are not not good at building i dont recomend it. somtimes your parkis a success andsomtimes its not. you also have to whait for more money. if do not like to wait for money than you should play the sandbox. there is wild life roller coasters and pools with water slides. makeshure your rollercoasters are safe. for me i like this game so i rated it as thumbs up. its up to you to chose if you like it or not.

You actually have the possibility to do basically anything you could ever imagine. This game features great attention to user creativity, and the carreer missions add an extra challenge in as well. Overall, compared to other theme park tycoons and just tycoons in general, this one is much more pick your own path and nonlinear and sparks great imaginative projects. Well made.

You can build a standard theme park, or a water park, or a zoo, or a combo of all of them.I would have liked a little more control over research though.And remember- set prices to what they would have been like in the 90's (When the game was made)			",73,28,3,27,37,1,48

												I originally purchased this game when it first came out a in '06. At the time, I honestly didn't like it because of the change in design from the first two games. Seven years later, I wanted to play RCT2, but it wasn't available on Steam. RCT3 was on sale, so I decided to buy it. Since I haven't played either of the original two in years, it felt natural to play this one. Years later, the franchise is still awesome with excellent replayability, from campaigns to the sandbox mode.			",139,40,3,13,54,1,39

												Do I recommend this game? ♥♥♥♥ yes I do. Unfortunately the Campaign mode is lacking majorly compared to the first two in terms of creativity, and lack of it, but is made up for easily with it's major features that improved on everything that made the first two limited to perfection. 3d camera control is nice compared to the old isometric view for making tighter twists in coasters, the graphics are more flashy which helps distinguish some things, there is a fast forward function which is helpful in tedious tasks, and the best of all Sandbox mode which you will never get bored of making different types of parks and spending hours on massive theme parks. Definitely get this game if you feel creative and imaginative, and even if you remotely remember playing even a minute of the first RollerCoaster Tycoon, grab this if you ever see it below half price.

As you can expect, with RollerCoaster Tycoon 3, you can build the park of your dreams. You can take on a campaign park, or take on the challenge of using sandbox to build your own park from scratch. The options are yours, and you can pick however you want it to run. This game is very family friendly, and although the graphics aren't the greatest due to it's age, it is still lovable.

												With the very little time I have had with this game, I can already tell you that this is overall a good tycoon game. You actually have the possibility to do basically anything you could ever imagine. This game features great attention to user creativity, and the carreer missions add an extra challenge in as well. Overall, compared to other theme park tycoons and just tycoons in general, this one is much more pick your own path and nonlinear and sparks great imaginative projects. Well made.

												After all this years, this game remains the unchallenged champion of theme park simulations!Its Rollercoaster editor is beyond imagination, and for the joy of the lazy ones it's also packed with an unbelievable collection of pre-designed coasters (including many perfect copies of real-world ones from famous theme parks)!The expansions (all included in the platinum version) greatly enhance the experience and grant hours of fun and a high replayability factor, whether you choose to play the scenarios or just chill out in sandbox mode with no money hassle whatsoever.

												This game is amazing! Despite being released in 2004 this game is absoloutly amazing I love the ammount of content thats been provided ive played around 14hrs now after all that time on one sandbox map i havent even begun to scratch the surface of what great content the game has ive yet to look into the waterparks and the safari's. After the 14 or so hours on this one map i havent even filled it half way and this is just random rides spread out i can only imagine what parks with diffrent themed areas and diffrent elevated parks with monorails would look like and am looking foward to many many more hours creating more and more parks. If your thinking about getting this game despite being from 2004 its 100% worth £15 but nows the time to buy it during the winter sale at half the normal price if you dont like the game you can easly get a refund ;).Also check out a game coming soon by the same guys behinde this wonderful game Planet Coaster imo it looks far better than RCTW (Roller Coaster Tycoon Worlds).

												Played this game a bunch as a kid and it was hella fun, though I could never figure out how to make firework shows. Just bought it again after almost 10 years, immediately figured the firework system out, and am now setting up extremely complex shows for my 2-coasters-and-a-pool park. You can do anything in this game (even pluck all the feathers off the birds that fly by!) and I absolutely love it. Definitely still one of my favourite games!			",54,5,0,9,16,0,14

												Old but gold! Fantastic game! I had this game and it's predecessor games when they were only found in cereal boxes. Only now I have it with the expansions that I never knew about until I got it on steam. It adds a great deal to the game. Tons of fun, there's a career mode if you feel like you need to have an objective, and there is also sanbox mode, if you're more into free building epic amusment parks.I named my park ""Call of Duty: kids"" then named multiple roller coasters ""F-ing your mom"" and all the people that went on it thought ""I enjoyed f-ing your mom"" when they got off. I pretty much created call of duty in a nutshell.10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So I bought this game awhile ago. I could not get into it at that time.Recently I started Playing it again and 7 hours later there I was building a giant green house by the entranceThis game is fun although I can't seem to figure  out  how to make a usable roller-coaster and I have no idea how to make a water ride.The Peeps in the games are abit loud and trying to figure out everything when you first start playing can be a real pain even with the guide.I haven't got the chance to play career mode yet but sandbox mode is fun and very time consuming.There is a small issue thoughSome times after leaving your game on and putting your computer to sleep when you go to play it again its invisible and you cant do anything about it, it makes your screen 3/4 unusable until you  sign out or shut down task manager does nothing it always launches on the unusable side rendering you to restart sign out or shut down your computerOther then that the game is fun a bit loud at times but fun and my rating out of 10 is 7.5Its fun and addicting but takes forever to build anything fancy I would have rated it higher if I could figure everything outand if that glitch doesn't happen but over all I recommend this game			",147,47,1,19,18,1,2

If your save file is bigger than 12MB it will start to crash.A bit pricey for a game thats 12 years old as of 2016.			",44,2,4,0,17,0,2

												A very good sequel to the successful RCT 1 and 2. Although, it was very buggy and a bit unfinished at launch, the designers did not let the product and fans down along the way and corrected and even improved the game thereafter.It is loyal to the franchise and bring your game even further with the addition of animals in one of its expansions.Great game!I recommand buying it, it a good deal on Steam.

												It's a great successor to previous games. Great graphics for its time, the ability to ride everything in your park, great UI; there has always been a unique style to RCT.If it's so great, why thumbs down? Well, because it crashes. It's a known issue that has yet to be resloved. I recommend not wasting your money unless some saint decides to patch it. For me, this problem has rendered the game unplayable.

												Okay as a standalone game it's pretty good, when it comes to tycoon. It's RCT, though.It's incredibly restrictive with customization, compared to RCT2. So my parks all end up looking kind of similar to each other, which really takes away a lot of replay value in the game. These kind of simulators basically rely on replay value, so I don't recommend it.Unless, of course, you've never played RCT2. But, if you're looking at 3 you might as well just go for 2.

												I'm not one to write reviews, but the controls for this game are awful. They make it so hard to make a slight incline/decline and have it even that you can place a path over it and have it all connect to each ohter, and if you do manage to connect it, you have all ready spent half an hour trying to do it.

												Huge fan of the RCT series love the hole theme park management aspect. However, I can not recommend RCT3, as many others my main complaint is the controls and interface. It's fairly unintuitive and would have much rather them have kept the original interface and controls and improved on those but they replaced that with a number of fairly difficult and tiny menues that are somewhat difficult to differentiate from each other.The only way I'd recommend this addition to the series is if you got it on sale and in the bundle, otherwise just buy the first two and skip this one.

												You basically can't play this game on newer designs. It IS a good game, don't get me wrong, but you can't really play this game without glitches and bugs, with the occasional crash. A good game to design roller coasters, but not to build a huge park on. ( Atleast not on newer platforms. ex: windows 8, 10, etc. )			",27,2,0,0,6,0,0

												How could I not recommend this game? RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 is a blast from the past; the several hours I spent designing parks and succeeding, destroying people's lives, and making employees go insane. Just the several outcomes when of what could happen to park over time, assuming you're there to build the best theme park in the world, or there to cause havok. Why not do both by creating several parks? The world truly is your oyster.10/10			",403,143,10,52,24,4,29

												UI is very clunky. I have fond memories of this game, but it is unbearable to work with now. You can only place objects on a grid. Everything is on a grid. Don't be fooled by your fantasies of this game. There is a very limited amount of things you can do. The bounds are not endless. Also, terrain editing is horrible in this game, and any time you try to build around or through existing terrian, expect large parts of your terrian to be ruined. This game is not a fun experience down memory lane, it is a frustrating one.			",11,1,0,4,4,0,4

												Could be alright for some, just not for me.. Ive played and throughly enjoyed rollercoaster tycoon 1 and 2. RC3 was just a huge step in the other direction. They changed everything around so much that you literally have to learn how to play all over again. They changed one of my favorite childhood games to some confusing extra complicated wierd graphic monster! Some may find the courage and patience to try to tame this wild beast, im sure it has alot to offer! BUT ITS NOT THE SAME FOR ME! I DONT LIKE CHAAAANNNGEEEE! In short, I got flustered right away trying to play this game and failed horribly, Im not saying not to buy the game... Just dont buy it because you enjoyed RC1 and RC2.:)			",4,1,0,3,7,0,5

												Unlike RollerCoaster Tycoon 1 and 2 I don't feel that RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 stands the test of time all that well. The first two games featured sprites on a 2D plane and retains most of its charm and playability all these years later. RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 features fully 3D environments and they really show their age. The game doesn't look very good at all and while the gameplay is similar I feel its a little slower and a little more boring. Most of the people who have bought this game have played it in the past and have Nostalgia and can enjoy the game for what it is. If you've never played it before it might be a little hard to enjoy because of its age. Planet Coaster is the spiritual successor to this game (being made my the same developers) and is probably worth looking into if you're concerned about this game's age.That being said it runs perfectly fine on Windows 10 64bit and is perfectly playable. It just feels dated. With that being said I don't think I'd reccomend this game unless it was a part of your childhood or its on sale.EDIT: I've recently run into a very annoying bug where the park guests won't ride any of my rides. Its basically game breaking as I can't make any money and searching various forums turns up no real solutions.			",174,6,26,13,6,0,21

												Right, so I have been a big fan of the RCT franchise because they are awesome games. A few people in the positives have written that it's great to be able to create a park that's ""whatever you want"". Don't get me wrong but what I want from RCT3 is the RCT franchise I know and love, except better.So the graphics: They are bad. They have dated terribly. (They are old, yes, but they have aged tragically). A few people have said the opposite but look at the pictures with people in and you'll see what I mean. This isn't necessarily an issue, but my problem was that I wanted the plain looking characters from RCT1 and 2.The interface: Again, really not that good. In RCT1/2 the interface was simple. To save you hit the floppy disk. To get rides you hit the helter skelter, to build anything you hit the crane. Well fortunately this system has been replaced with one of excessive numbers of buttons that you will never want to touch. There's no intuitive building system either.So now to the details of the game:Shops/Stalls: Now have an added feature where you can add toppings/details. Neat, huh? You can decide whether customers get cheese on the burger or not. Whether they have ice in their drink. Ice Cream in their milkshake. Now, that's all well and good except when you're setting the price of the goods it doesn't tell you how much profit per item you will make, which is a pretty important detail. No? And you're not told the costs associated with adding a topping. How useful. I suppose at least they tell you when you're undercharging.3D rollercoaster rider: Well this is a neat feature. It's not a bad idea, especially when games like theme park had the feature from the beginning. There is an unfortunate problem though, it's jolty and a bit of an anti-climax. It's a neat feature though.""Parties"" of Guests: Another neat feature in concept but really unnecessary. I always figure that if a tycoon game starts to make its customers more complex in a sequel then you've got problems, but for RCT I thought it might work. After all, when was the last time you went to a theme park by yourself? Unfortunately it doesn't seem to operate under general logic. If someone is going to queue up for one ride for a month then surely you'd go and get some food or walk around the scenery? No, you instead clog paths and complain, ""my isn't it busy?""""Three difficulty modes"": Yeah... Nice try at claiming that. What that actually means is you can pass the level in three different ways. The customers aren't more difficult at a higher level, they don't need better ameneties or better roller coasters. Nope, you actually just get a more time constrained (or higher guest count/park value) with less time. Surely difficulty levels don't work that way?!?!?I am a massive (read: MASSIVE) fan of the franchise and I'd seriously suggest that if you want to give the game a go you should go and buy either roller coaster tycoon the first, or the second. The game is better. The graphics are /technically/ worse but in sum the game is better.EDIT: Anyone who is acting like I'm saying game graphics are important you will note I am saying that this gameplay is no better... and the graphics have aged badly. //This is a bad combination//.I agree that graphics aren't important, but they are a factor to be considered when buying a game.

												A year ago, I might have recommened this, but there is a good replacement for RTC3 out finally (or close to out), and it's made by the same developers. PLANET COASTER. That is the park builder you want, and it's the park builder you should buy. RCT3 was good when it came out, but it's built in with artificial performance limitations (notably save file size). In addition, it's quite unstable on newer operating systems, and has some unavoidable error messages. If you want a park builder at this budget, then one I can point you towards is Parchitect. There are others, but that has the closest feel to an RCT game (much closer to RCT2, actually).			",60,16,3,4,13,0,6

												I'll be honest, this game wasn't what I expected.  I was expecting a game where I'd have to start from scratch and create a plan decent enough to allow my park to get by.  Instead, I get scenarios where an entire park is already built for me, and would make more money if I just left it.  Every ride I make can't compare to the rides that are already there in the scenario, and is rendered ineffective.  It's not what I wanted, maybe it's what you want, but not what I wanted. Maybe it's just me.			",15,4,0,3,7,0,0

												I bought this game thinking I will have a great time since I read so many good reviews about it. I am not sure if my copy was possessed or if it was just the way it was meant to be. Either way, I only keep it in my library to remind myself that I need to make better choices in life. What exactly was wrong with the game? It wasn't just one thing. It was a bunch of small things that slowly angered me until I was utterly infuriated. The gameplay I experienced can only be described like this: It's like trying to stick your fork into the last pea on your plate. Whenever you think you got it the thing rolls away and you're left wondering why you've been punished. Similarly, it also leaves you feeling unsatisfied. Sure, you have the whole game. But that one last bite is still missing. That something was the soul of a theme park. I never actually felt as if I was playing a theme park simulator. It was simply too boring. I've always been a fan of tycoon games but I've never felt so enraged by a game in my life. I played through all the tutorials, read everything and made sure I understood everything. Yet the paths...the paths were acting like freaking hoodlums. Breaking whenever I thought I finally managed to build the path correctly and will be able to open the ride. But just as I tried to open the ride...bam...the freaking path trolled me again by breaking. Then I fixed the path...only for it to break in another location. I googled this and realized other people also have this issue. I tried to follow their recommendations...I really tried. I never managed to get past two rides because that path be failing every time. Everything in the game takes too much time. Going through the menu takes time, building things takes forever. (And don't think you'll be building awesome rides at first because that takes too long). Seriously, I get that there's a bit of a learning curve but after a while that just fails to excite. After all, I play games so I can instill the fake belief that I'm actually good at things, not to remind myself that I can't get my act together in a game either. I could still deal with all the time consuming parts in the game, the swarm of bugs and long tutorials, if it wasn't for the paths. I know I mentioned it before but I cannot stress enough how much the paths ruined my life. It was a when a path screamed its final hoorah and broke one time too many that I flew into a rage and uninstalled the game. Whenever I think about this game and the money I spent on it I become so horribly enraged. I'm normally a calm person but I doubt anything I can say will ever be able to capture the pure passion with which I hate this game. I truly wish I had a physical copy of this game. Why? So I can either A. rip it to shreds while I cry from frustration or B. eat it and have my body dissolve it into the poop that it was to me.			",29,14,0,4,4,1,4

												I was really excited to finally play a RCT game after nearly fourteen years, even more so after the original game disks for RCT2 wouldn't load properly on my computer. However, I became pretty confused at the menus for the game and on how to simply do things in the game.For starters, there is NO HOT KEYS programmed into the game. Another review mentions that you can rotate the camera with two keys, and then you can move around the map with the directional keys (or asdw). But that is IT. How they set it up to make the roller coasters themselves would be MUCH easier if you could use the directional keys. I lost count on how many times I had to delete tracks because I accidentally did it wrong because of the cumbersome interface.Let me say that again: it's confusing to make roller coasters in this game. Considering it's RollerCoaster Tycoon, that isn't a good thing. If your roller coaster happens to go underground, if you delete it, it doesn't undo the large hole in the ground. If you make a roller coaster too tall, it doesn't tell you it's too tall; it just says you can't build there, which causes some confusion as you try to go around it all. Messing with the ground is one of the most frustrating thing ever. Last night, I was able to make a pretty cool body of water under my roller coaster. Hours later, I decided to make a ferry in that lake to get to the other side. For some reason, I then couldn't edit the ground that I had edited earlier to make that lake; I actually could not make a deeper lake for my ferry to really go by. Then I had loads of trouble making paths that actually lined up with the buildings and rides. For at least an hour, I didn't realize that people couldn't go to the shops I made because the path ""didn't line up"" with it. People got stuck on pathways around there, so I had to tinker around with the path for at least thirty minutes just to get it right.The menus are just terrible here. Constantly I just pressed around until I got what I wanted. And with no hot keys, it made the process even more tedious than it should have been.So bottom line: I am playing this game, and I will be playing it more. But I am really disappointed in the controls and interface. I only played it on sandbox, where I have unlimited money; I can't imaging playing it and actually trying to make a profit. It was cool making that one roller coaster and ""riding"" it, and of course it's always fun to make that death roller coaster and watching people scatter and fall out of it. But I can't see me actually trying to make a successful park out of this. I'd rather try to get RCT2 working again.			",71,19,0,7,17,1,4

												I don't normally write negative reviews, but this game is clunky, nothing feels easy, fun, or intuitive to do. The layout is also really confusing, I have no idea where to find anything.I'm sure if I spent more time with it, I could get past that, but it's not NEARLY as ""Pick up and Play"" as RCT1&2.Also, the game is honestly pretty ugly. The charming and colourful sprite based graphics have been replaced with muddy brown polygons. Nothing looks fun or cool.Instead of playing this, go get RCT2, that one is still a TON of fun			",158,35,1,17,10,1,7

												It seems like a decent game if you like the old style tycoon games. I didn't enjoy it though, the UI was excruciatingly tiny, random and difficult to use. Constantly getting frustrated with the weird controls and having to close every single window in the UI manually one for one was very irritating. There is no indication (or I didn't see any) of whether you are losing money or gaining so you would just have to wait for a real long time and see for yourself by constantly staring at your available money. The controls are unnecessarily difficult and useless. If you like old games then you'll probably like this one, the heavily outdated game controls and engine are very distasteful to me, (even though it is old and limited by the time) it felt almost lazy in developing better user friendly controls and UI. If there was a remake to fix all these problems then I'll maybe consider it...			",24,7,0,4,11,0,7

												I love the original Rollercoaster Tycoon and was pleased to move up to 3 when given the option by a friend.   At first glance, it's pretty, nicely updated, a great step forward.  The sheer amount of stuff you could build was impressive and lord the options.  There was so many gentle rides and a plethora of restaurants to choose from, you could almost build a full park from their options alone.The water rides got a nice increase, with way more choices and little things like fireworks, scenery options, and zoo attractions where nice and should have been included way earlier than this (Like in the first game).Then I got into the game play of actually building a park and rides and discovered just how much I truly hated this version of the game.  I found the controls to be extremely frustrating, which in the end, left me uninstalling it and going back to the original where I apparently belong. A makeover in graphics and more options doesn't make a better game.  Seriously... why was it that hard to build a simple ride line...  ",55,12,0,15,14,0,22

(The game is very old and came out right when 3D games were starting to be big).PLEASE AVOID THIS AND GET RCT 2 INSTEAD!!!!			",98,31,1,12,8,1,7

Posted: June 3, 2015
												I had a few friends rave about RollerCoaster Tycoon and decided to give it a try when it was on sale.  I played Sim Theme Park when I was younger and had a blast with it and I hoped that RollerCoaster Tycoon would fill that void.  I was wrong.  While this game boasts some serious depth with regards to how many different types of rollercoasters, rides, and scenery you can build, those items seem irrelevant while playing (they are just for you, the AI doesn't notice it too much) and don't make up for the game's basic functionality shortcomings.The first problem I experienced was building a rollercoaster is a serious time investment.  While that is fun at first, I spent a very long time just trying to complete the circuit, which is arguably the least fun part of building a coaster.  Then I had to create the entrance and exit and found myself spending more time creating a working queue that fit with my coaster design yet still didn't attract enough riders to fill it even a quarter of the way up.My trouble really stems from the user interface for RollerCoaster Tycoon.  All the buttons are quite cryptic (just tiny icons that you have to memorize.  For example, the guest list icon has a wrench on it, which is easily confused with the staff icon, which also has a wrench on it) and I was unable to easily find hotkeys for basic tasks such as deletion, which is a two click operation each time.  The escape key, which in most games just exits the last or top-most open menu, always prompts you whether to leave your current game.  It is as if the interface designers hadn't ever played other games and made their own independent system, putting the responsibility on the user to learn how to play.The other half of my issues comes from excessive depth in construction.  As I said before, I must have spent an hour creating a path because I wasn't allowed to build it under certain segments of my coaster, while I could under other segments.  I do accept some blame for not thinking through my design, but I came from the Sim Theme Park universe, where I could have fun creating a rollercoaster and would spend more time making money from it than from building the entrances and exits.  This problem extends to shops and kiosks where if you don't toggle the ""auto-levelling"" feature (which should arguably be toggled on by default), even if it is up against a path, the ignorant AI can't get to the food or items.Overall, RollerCoaster Tycoon is a headache with its strange interface and picky construction rules.  I had some fun with it, but my last game was so annoying that I had to write this review.  Sim Theme Park was a great example of a fun and deep theme park game.  Yes, it was a bit cartoony and maybe even a little childish, but the interface and construction guidance allowed for some serious creativity and challenging gameplay.  Rather than frustration over how to finish your coaster and get the entrance sorted out, SimTheme Park allowed you to focus on goals of each mission.			",63,9,3,5,12,0,22

												By far the weakest game in the series which considering it was the latest one is actually quite a feat. Graphically the game looks horrible and the animation has had so many corners cut it's circular. The game provides very little UI or gameplay improvement to compensate for the ultimately lackluster attempt at making an 'immersive' game in the genre.			",479,136,12,70,74,6,77

												old game, looks terrible on new computers and the controls are awful...bought it for nostalgia sake, but unfortunately this game does not have the appeal that it used to for me.  This game is way overpriced and i wished i would have burned my 20 bucks rather than download it...seems like i would be able to get a refund since i hardly played it.			",54,25,4,15,23,4,3

												It's addicting and fun for a while, but the major irritations ruin the enire game for me. I never was able to build a coaster that actually worked. Any slight incline, despite a powered launch and every attempt aiding the cart to be able to go up, caused the damn thing to roll backwards. I could not figure out how to connect the exit of Crazy Golf to a path. Once you try to change the surrface terrain and you screw up, fixing your mistake can be impossible to figure out. So do I recommend this game? Not really. I'd love to try a new Roller Coaster Tycoon game with updated capabilities and much much easier controls.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought ""Roller Coaster Tycoon 3: Platinum!"" in a weak moment. Here's a game that I've wanted to play for years, because, you know, in 2004 it sounded like fun, and ""Tycoon"" games were all the rage back then. But the price has been artificially high since forever, and I've always had something better to play. Finally on Steam, and finally a daily sale, in 2013. Unfortunately, I didn't really enjoy this game. Too much tutorial, not enough game. I stuck around long enough to learn how to make my own coaster and ride in first-person view, and TBH that's all I really wanted to do. :-DI scratched that itch, but I won't be back. Enjoy my $4, Steam.			",168,52,2,18,21,2,22

												Ugh. I really shouldn't be suprised. Everything in this game felt soulless and even hostile at times. I can only visualize the developers of this game as some sort of corporate zombies, tasked to emulate Roller Coaster Tycoon using New Three D Technology(tm). No thought was put into this game. nothing new. nothing original. nobody asking, ""What's the best way to implement this feature that would be the most pleasing/ interesting/ convenient for the user?""       The UI was the first sign that something was horribly wrong. Almost all of the menus are on the lefthand side of the screen in a long unlabled column of vague icons which, when clicked, open up another long unlabeled column of icons. I'm sure with a little effort, I could memorize what each of the icons does, but why bother? Nothing in this game is thought out or intuitive. There's no sensible organization to the list of icons. Maybe I'll try to get around it by using hot keys? ""HAHA! WHAT ARE HOTKEYS? THIS IS THE FUTURE, HERE IN THE FUTURE THERE IS ONLY ONE BUTTON AND A POINTY TRIANGLE."" Really. All I can do with my keyboard is rotate the camera, Q and E. Two buttons.        Need to toggle on/off trees so I can see where I'm building my path? Lefthand column. Video controls. Toggle scenery off.... Wait... That toggles everything off? Even raised paths and rides? And they're totally invisible now? Not even a shadow to see what I'm connecting to? I just wanted to turn off trees!       But wait! there's a third key on the keyboard that woks! It's escape! No matter where you are in the game, pressing escape will bring up a box asking if you want to quit. The yes button is higlighted. The game knows. It begs to be put to rest, and forgotten into the oblivion of time. Let it's ancestors stand tall in the glory of thier nostalgic memory, but please let the world forget the bottomless misery of the last ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child of the  Roller Coaster Tycoon line. Sleep now poor soul. May oblivion take you painlessly.			",199,43,2,36,18,0,33

												They made it worse than Roller Coaster Tycoon 2. Employees quit which is a neat idea but they never tell you why so spending anytime organizing your staff feels like a gamble because they might just leave. Also they took out the ability to just start with an empty park, a loan and a dream. You can only play Career mode situations or sandbox. All I wanted to do was build my own park and that's just not allowed unless you ignore money which is just not a challenge at all. Also the UI is somehow worse, RCT2 made sense to me with it's menus and hotkeys in this game I didn't find any useful hotkeys and the menus feel clunky trying to find certain things. This I admit would get better with time but I won't be putting time into this game. It's still Roller Coaster Tycoon just a bit worse.			",95,16,2,14,30,1,15

												I dont know what it is that made the old Rollercoaster Tycoon games so much fun for me, but this game does not have it; I am bored to tears by this.I must have spent half of my teenage life playing the first and second games, and I still go back and play them sometimes, but I cant keep myself in front of this one for an hour. Something was lost by this series, and I cant honestly tell you what it is. All I know is... this game is bland and boring.			",121,54,0,49,24,0,53

												5/10 Ever played a RCT game before? Me too, then I got the gamer's high and figured I'd try this old horse out again with all the shiny updates, new cover and a number ""3"" instead of a number ""2"" at the end of the title.What a waste of money.It's just as laggy and mindless as I remember, which some people like, I grant you, but I am not one of those types. This is an excellent game for a child under the age of 14 who is just breaking into a real gaming PC, but maybe FPSs or RTSs are too complicated; or the machine you're using is so out-dated that this is the only game you can play. Honestly, I see no real changes to this edition when I put it aside RCT 2. The graphics are nicer and more smooth, but all the employees, rides, options and flavour is the exact same. Sure the ""story"" mode has different maps and settings, but at the end of the day you're just running another crappy amusment park, advertising in the same venues, and figuring out the best way to rip off faceless droves of NPCs just enough that you gouge them without turning them away. It's a micro-manager's wet dream much in the same way that EVE is, but very much without the rewarding sense of accomplishment or space lasers.			",28,8,0,20,10,0,11

The other RCT games were good, but this one is just as good if not better. Its a little more challenging, but you have a lot more options to choose from, such as the fireworks display and water/wild rides. You can also use the camera mode to view the ride in first person.

The carreer is also really long with all the missions together so plenty of play time there.I really like there is plenty of choice of coasters and rides to choose from i just wish there where a few more coasters that they added like wing coasters and other coasters.I have not really played yet with the scenery yet so i cant really say much about that.Pros:Many ridesLong carreer modeCoasters buildingcons:Have not found any yet.

												I never played RollerCoaster Tycoon before, so for me the nostalgia part doesn't quite exists.What I can tell about this game is that it is SUPER fun... If you are a begginer like me you should play at some of the tutorials, they will teach you how to control your Amusement park, while showing you the cool features of the game.The Sandbox mode, is a good place to practice your RollerCoaster building skills as well as Ground Shaping skills. (Also you may compare it with the ""MOTHERLOAD"" code in Sims, which gives you a LOT of money)The Campaign mode, is another type of challenge where you need build certain building and stand up to some standarts whileas keeping inside a budget.There are also more different modes that help you understand more of the game, or just build crazy machines and laser shows for future needs.I really recomend it, especially if you are a fan of making people sick on ride, by building a rollercoaster drop from 50 meters!

												RCT 3 is a major step forward in the RCT franchise and adds so much more to the game that it would be very hard to be bored with this game. Being able to now ride the rides was a much needed necessity and added so much depth to the game itself. The larger park size was enough to create any playground of fun without running out of room for expansion. Bringing forward most of the features that were in the previous title, it still feels very much like and has the touch of a RCT game.Now with that said, it does have some drawbacks. The cartoonish peeps are just not as vibrant as the little peeps in RCT2. The peep interaction in RCT 2 feels more fun and vibrating. Building roller coasters in RCT 2 felt more fun and puzzling. That's not to say that RCT 3 coasters were dull, because they weren't. they just lacked the circus fun that RCT 2 had. Creating buildings in RCT 3 had more options and became easier and felt more real. Adding billboards added to the realism of real life parks and made a major difference in aesthetic pleasure. Being able to create your own fireworks show with the Mixmaster was a major step forward and added an extra layer to building a awesome park and helped bring the park alive, something that RCT 2, at times, lacked.The water and animal expansion packs helped bring the game to full circle, allowing versatility in building any kind of theme park that you could imagine. Being able to create pools was another needed must have that the game deserved and gave the ability to choose what kind of Theme Park you wanted to create from an animal park to just a water park to a coaster haven. RCT 3 is a complete game with three games wrapped into one.  There is no question that Frontier Developments brought the series to a new level which gave you the option to never get bored with game. Hours on end, there is no question that RCT 3 is a winner is all aspects and changed the series forever upping the ante on how future versions would be crafted and created. 5 stars out of 5 stars. Highly recommended for die-hard fans of the series.			",4,0,0,1,14,0,0

Great game but mainly becuase I haven't been exposed to the previous RCT's. But overall I think this game is enjoyable and easy to pick up. If I had kids they would be playing this. If you are buying it wait till it is discounted if you can and access steam alot. Hope this helped. GOT TO GET BACK TO MY PEEPS!!!			",2,0,0,0,4,0,1

												It's exactly what you expect it to be: A theme park simulator. There's a lot of options for customization, creativity and level designs that make this game lots of fun. There really isn't too much to say about it honestly. The graphics are a bit out of date in today's world, but it works perfectly and that's what matters. Unfortunately, there isn't a way to screw around with people like you could in Sims Theme Park, but that's only for those perverted people like me who take pleasure out of that sort of thing.Ultimately, it's a good game that will withstand the test of time until a newer version shows up to update the graphics and add more to it.

												I used to spend countless hours playing the original RollerCoaster Tycoon way back on my Windows 98SE PC.When I wasn't able to find the original game, I bought this sequel.I didn't find RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 to be as much fun as the original. Also, it doesn't seem to run very well under Windows 7.I turned-on compatability-mode and running it as an Administrator, but it still chugs; since my PC is more than powerful enough to play the latest FPS games, I don't think it's my PC's fault.The gameplay doesn't feel as natual/intuitive as the original, but it has some nice additions; you now have:- the ability to build detailed pool areas- animals and fences to keep them contained- more indepth personalities (employees can get annoyed and want to quit; but they'll warn you first)Overall it's a fun game but if you're expecting this to be like the original, you'll be dissappointed.

												Simply put an awesome game. If you are into designing parks and rollercoasters this is the game for you. If you do not mind a clunkier interface I also recommend the earlier iterations of this series. It is an old game so you have to change resolution in a text file under the %appdata% Atari folder. 1920x1200 and 1920x1080 works just fine.I have played the campaign on an i7  win7 computer and have had no performance issues. Although I have had some slow down issues on older computers (disc, non steam version) when designing larger parks. Still, it's always been playable and fun, for me, for the past 10 years.

												This is a fantasic game with a plethora of features and building potential. There are two main gmae types available to play:Mission scenarios in which you are given objectives to complete by expanding a basic pre-made park.Sandbox mode in which you have infinite money and can build however you want. You are able to construct: roller coasters, pool complexes, zoos and more.I personally spend most of my time on the sandbox mode, as I particulary enjoy the creative aspects of the game.The graphics may be slightly 'outdated' by comparison to newer games - but to be honest I don't care.I would definitely reccomend this game.

												Without a single doubt, RCT3 is a time consuming, coaster building, amusement gaining good time. Though a few things that made RCT2 unique are not present in this one, there's still more than enough to settle for. The game comes with all the expansion packs; Soaked, and Wild, both with an acceptable amount of new features. The transition to 3D looks rather dated up close, but from a distance it appears to look similar to some tycoon games on the new market today, but of course this would be the least graphically advanced of the bunch. Though campaigns are laughably shorter than the previous titles, this feels like a good move because something the previous installments lacked was the ability to keep the player caring on a single map with the limited choices to make for around four hours on a first run. Instead, you'll be on a map for around a good hour and that's the perfect amount of time you need before it begins to get dull. When you move to another map, the experience is always renewed because of how many new options you obtain. Sandbox mode is here for new players to experiment around with endless money and restrictions, so you can jump right in and learn for yourself. Tutorial sessions are also available. Replayability is a sweet refreshment to this game because the Platinum edition itself is around a good 35 hours, and with the ability to be creative on sandbox, complete all the tycoon challenges, and the map editor (you heard me right!) the game will never get old. If you can get over it's childish appeal, (and as an ""unmentioned"" comment, the land editing mechanics) it's here to give you literally endless hours of solid entertainment.8.5/10			",174,23,6,7,12,1,6

												Having never been a fan of ""management"" games like SimCity I came into RCT3 a little worried that I'd become overwhelmed and eventually bored by too much micromanaging. Happy to say that was not the case at all here! The game lets you access sandbox mode and every single coaster, attraction, bathroom stall, right from the get-go, allowing you to get a feel for the game before you even start career mode.The game feels more focused on park-creation rather than micro-managing. Rarely do I ever really adjust things like ride-prices or hire/fire staff frequently. You can upgrade staff members up to 2 levels, making them faster and more efficient which means you don't need as many of that type of staff.There's a nice level of customization as well. You can import custom music (though .wma files seem to only work for me) and custom pictures for things like billboards or customized sale stalls. There's also a decent variety of colors for the rides but I felt like the palette was very bland, it can either feel too boring or too bright. You can also import/export coasters and build your own scenarios. There are also tons of mods and additions you can find through different resources and communities online.The addictive part is when you start scenarios in career mode and begin building a park the way you want it. The game gives you very basic objectives such as ""Have X amount of attendance in the park"" or ""Get X approval rating"" and usually these can be accomplished anytime. Meanwhile while you manage, you research into more attractions and coaster-types you can add. It's so entertaining watching ""Peeps"" ride your creations and you feel accomplished when you make something your virtual guests enjoy.Some of the game's controls are a bit odd. I was kinda surprised by the lack of any sort of ""undo"" button, so it gets a bit annoying if you accidentally delete something or put something down you didn't want. I also ran into issues that weren't explained well by the game, and had trouble figuring out how to build certain things. Google wasn't exactly the first place I wanted to go to get answers, but thankfully it was more than enough help. Just a few minor gripes, but hasn't stopped me from playing. If you haven't played it before I definitely recommend it. Just expect to be at your computer for a few hours at a time; It's incredibly addictive!			",27,11,0,1,3,0,0

Holy crap, I can build swimming pools, waterslides, zoos, and wild animal safaris, too? Freakin' sweet!			",227,60,20,55,152,1,147

												If you liked the original Roller Coaster Tycoon games (maybe you got yours in a cereal box, too) and you're looking for a little nostalgia and park building, then this game's for you. It requires little to no effort to kill a lot of time, and it's still just as fun as it's always been to pick the little ""peeps"" up with giant tweezers and put them in the lake. Is that just me?

												So yeah, Roller Coaster Tycoon. What can you even say about it really? It's a classic game series that pretty much boosted tycoon games (Other than Sim City) to more heights. So with the passage of time, Infograms we're bought out by atari and the original creator, Chris Sawyer, not working on it anymore, Atari tried to make there own RCT game; and this is how Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 came to be known as... an okay game.So I guess I have to say the pros and cons about it, soooooooooooooooooooooo...The game is now in 3D, and it works pretty well. The only real problem is trying to turn the camera up and down trying to find the perfect angle; It just resets and goes back to a semi top down perspective. The main focus of the game is that you can RIDE the RIDES, and you can kinda ride the rides, but not in the people or ""peep's"" point of view. Instead It's on the cart's point of view. Because the rides have feelings too you know. The gameplay is you're tipical tycoon game. But don't go building your rollercoaster of death and spooky scary skeletons, you see this game has an antagonist. The Park Inspector. He hate's everything fun and will make you throw out your anger on the keyboard. You're roller coaster is a little bit unsafe? SHUT IT DOWN! Water slide landing in the wrong pool? SHUT IT DOWN! He really makes the game less fun and you can't take him out. Also, you can't kill people in the game. I guess it makes the game more casualized since there's no worry of screwing up your coaster. Oh and one more thing to add. The zoo expansion is just Zoo Tycoon so just ask someone how Zoo Tycoon plays and that's RCT 3's Zoo expansion in a nutshell. The Water expansion just adds pools which don't really need an explanation. Same with Water Slides.So yeah, It's an okay game but not as good as the other games in the series. Really, if it was it's own game without the RCT game I think I would have liked it more, not to say It's a bad game. But with the price, I don't recommend it. Wait for a sale to get it, trust me you'll thank me later.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For those who relish in nostalgia, or for those just coming across it, Roller Coaster Tycoon is the quintessential tycoon game. The third installment in the series far surpasses the second, but is almost a different breed than the first. Not to argue that it isn't an improvement, simply that the two games seem to offer quite a unique playing style while both being part of the same franchise. The ability to ride coasters in a first-person view, is a welcome addition in this version of the game. The fireworks mixmaster disply is decent enough, however there seems to be some lacking instructional material that covers the laser light show side of the same rig. Nevertheless, Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 is a very solid purchase and a classic addition to any game library. Four stars.			",96,51,1,4,18,0,11

												I remember playing the first Rollercoaster Tycoon as a kid with my sister. Good old nostalgia tempted me into buying this when it was on sale one day, and I've never regretted the decision. RollerCoaster Tycoon is a simple game with a simple objective: you build a theme park. While you can play the campaign and aim for creating a profitable park and meet certain objectives, you can also opt to play the sandbox mode instead. Aside from the sandbox mode, there is also the scenario builder. You can create your own perameters for how you want to play the game. Do you want certain weather or infinite money? Go for it. RollerCoaster Tycoon might be on the older side, but it is certainly a game that can be enjoyed by any age.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This has been a go-to game for me for years. It's a bit dated but it's a wonderful sandbox full of creative potential. You can build coasters and other fun rides and then actually ride them in your park. Expect this: The lack of an undo button (except when building coasters, THANK GOD) can get frustrating, especially for beginners. Still worth it. This never bores me.			",70,21,3,18,37,3,31

												I searched my bank account looking for the 89 Million I'd need to build my dream rollercoaster- namely one that ascends 500 feet followed by a 90 degree drop into an unfinished section that dumps the coaster onto a walkway where my meandering park guests walk back and forth.  Then it hit me- I could have my dream for the price of a few McDonald's value meals and not worry about the real life death and destruction my idea would cause (plus I couldn't find the 89m)!  This game is so fun even if it is over half a decade old.  I wish they'd come out with the updated version already!  But if you are a builder and looking for a great deal on a fun game then just go for it! You'll love RCT3 Platinum.			",1,0,0,0,2,0,0

It actually has Strategy involved, so its not just a Sim game like most might think.			",1777,705,53,207,196,20,305

												I definitely reccomend this to fans of older RollerCoaster Tycoon games. It isn't complicated to play, it has some pretty fun moments, and you can pretty much create the park of your dreams. If you do get bored you can rain terror on your guests by having rollercoasters cars flighing off tracks or going straight into the pathways and running over guests. And did I mention you can go on your rides with the fricken in-ride view? All in all this game's awesome.10/10			",170,27,5,17,9,0,5

												This has been a go-to game for me for years. It's a bit dated but it's a wonderful sandbox full of creative potential. You can build coasters and other fun rides and then actually ride them in your park. Expect this: The lack of an undo button (except when building coasters, THANK GOD) can get frustrating, especially for beginners. Still worth it. This never bores me.			",70,21,3,18,37,3,31

												This is a fantasic game with a plethora of features and building potential. There are two main gmae types available to play:Mission scenarios in which you are given objectives to complete by expanding a basic pre-made park.Sandbox mode in which you have infinite money and can build however you want. You are able to construct: roller coasters, pool complexes, zoos and more.I personally spend most of my time on the sandbox mode, as I particulary enjoy the creative aspects of the game.The graphics may be slightly 'outdated' by comparison to newer games - but to be honest I don't care.I would definitely reccomend this game. Especially if it is in the sale! ",4,1,0,0,1,0,1

												RCT3 is potentially one of my favorite games. I've been a roller coaster lover since I was a kid, so maybe it's that.The game has multiple scenarios you can play through, or mess around in a sandbox or custom scenario. There is no store where you can buy things with real money, everything is in the game. Another plus is this is platinum edition, so you get access to the Wild expandsion pack and the Soaked expansion pack, both adding quite a few things to the game.Of course, you can construct any roller coaster you would like for your park, or select a premade one. You can also save your coasters to use in a different game, or perhaps even a RCT4.The graphics are fairly well, being a decade old game, except the people in the game have blocky faces, though this can be quite funny.The finance system is extremely designed. You have to hire janitors and mechanics, and you have to pay them a salary. Shops and rollercoasters cost money to run, so you need to make sure that the amount of money they are pulling in from the people outweighs the running cost, otherwise you will go into debt. You can also run ad campains to advertise your park and have people come visit. These include coupons for specific rides, a get in free coupon, or just a plain advertisement. Of course, these cost money, just like they would in real life, so you can't spend all your savings on ad campains.Overall an extremely fun game which has a good finance system and if you love roller coasters, you will love this game to death.9.5/10did i mention you can ride your coasters?

												This game is fun to the brim. I put 5 hours on it the first day I got it. Building custom roller coasters are cool, but getting to ride them in first person is awesome. This Platinum version has the ""Soaked!"" and ""Wild!"" extensions allowing you to make water rides and have creatures. You can build your dream park with this game. I would recommend waiting for a sale on this game but if you are willing to spend $20, then get it now!			",13,2,4,0,9,0,0

												One of the worst - no wait - the worst installment of the Roller Coaster Tycoon franchise. If you played the original, first version from 1999 and valued it for its simple yet multifaceted gameplay then this game will badly crush your dreams. Ugly as hell 3D graphics - even for 2005 standards - and an interface so clumsy that you can destroy a painstakingly constructed rollercoaster with just one click. It wasn't developed by Chris Sawyer directly anymore like its predecessors. It was said that he had just taken a consulting position. Obviously that either didn't help or they didn't really consult him at all.If you're thinking about buying this in a Steam sale (like I did), save yourself the money and buy and awesome indie game instead.

												Played this game as a kid for many many hour, absolutely fantastic. Though I have to say I can't really recommend getting any particular Roller Coaster Tycoon game over another, just wait 'till they're on sale and get them all, they're all really good! If you do like the ability to look around in 3D maybe you'll like this better, but I have found myself liking RCT2 better than 3 at times because in 3 the 3D gets complicated for me, vs the isometric view (which to be fair you can enable in RCT3) that allows you to not have to worry about camera angles too much. But on the contrary navigating eveything in 3D is way cool too. I don't know, this is a hard review for me to write, and I can't really say much useful except that if you like any RCT you should like this one too, they're all complimentary to each other. And RCT the original just has this awesome nostalgia with the low res graphics and music that's unforgettable. Just get them all!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not a bad management game, but you figure out how things work very early on and it doesn't seem to deviate from that formula at all.The single player scenarios are pretty good, but you wouldn't replay them.Sandbox is available, if that's your thing? ",56,14,1,14,5,0,16

												I searched my bank account looking for the 89 Million I'd need to build my dream rollercoaster- namely one that ascends 500 feet followed by a 90 degree drop into an unfinished section that dumps the coaster onto a walkway where my meandering park guests walk back and forth.  Then it hit me- I could have my dream for the price of a few McDonald's value meals and not worry about the real life death and destruction my idea would cause (plus I couldn't find the 89m)!  This game is so fun even if it is over half a decade old.  I wish they'd come out with the updated version already!  But if you are a builder and looking for a great deal on a fun game then just go for it! You'll love RCT3 Platinum.			",1,0,0,0,2,0,0

												Addictive would be the word for this game. In an arena where you have to manage, and build, yet are still able to exercise your creativity, the possibilities are endless. Build the theme park of your dreams, try to top the ones you've been to already, or just try to figure out ways to make heaps of money in as many ways possible!I've read comments about the graphics; personally, I don't mind. The 3D makes the rides look amazing, and the little details in the landscape really make the whole thing pop. All in all, lots of fun!			",15,1,0,6,1,0,1

												This game is so fantastic! The original RollerCoaster Tycoon was the game that got me into both video games as a whole and simulation management games. I remember buying RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 a few days after it released. I decided to get the Platinum version on Steam, when it went on sale, since I never bothered to pick up the expansions. This game has held up wonderfully. I havn't even made it to the expansion campaigns yet I'm addicted to just finishing the original. I have a large amount of nostalgia fueling my opinion but I still must recommend this game to anyone who likes simulation management.			",230,53,0,71,44,1,65

I played this game for loooooooong hours on my really old Dell Latitude D610. Yes, RCT:World is coming out soon, but this game still runs very well today and is amazing! Get this gem of a game now!

												Dont look at my total play time, I have each game. (regualar, gold, and platinum) I have always loved building parks. Since my pc(with my CD drive) is broken, I saw it was half off on steam. So, I went and bought it. So I could play it on my tablet. Ive been building parks since 2007. I love this game. If you have 4GB RAM+, the game probably wont lag at all. 3GB and below, the more guests and rides moving, the laggier it gets. If you love building big things, or control a park. GET THIS GAME. Just GET THE GAME! Many hours of fun and enjoyment. All you need is good stress relieving tips(If you're not able to wait) and a good PC!			",31,2,0,1,8,1,1

												Do not be fooled by the hours in this game on Steam. I have spent many of hours on this game ever since 2008 in a box retail version.How do I sum this game up?Well, this game is all about making Roller Coasters, right? It's in the title. Well, it is that, but it's way more than building roller coasters. You mainly build theme parks for people to enjoy in. Mostly, building coasters, rides, food stalls, and basically maintaining a theme park.To start out, I'd recommend you play in Sandbox mode so you can fool around with the editor. You have unlimited money and you start out on a superflat world with the biggest park size. There, you can build your park. Add roller coasters, make carousells, make other flat rides, as well as making food and drink stalls, with other things. The Platinum version of the game adds in the 2 other expansion packs: Soaked! and Wild!. Soaked adds in pools, more coasters, the ability to build underground, and more stuffs. Wild adds in the ability to make enclosures to house animals of many kinds, coasters, rides, and more. With these things all togeather, you can make a Mega Park/WaterPark/Zoo.But if you are willing for a challange, try out the career mode, where you are given a scenario, and you have to complete the objectives before you can move on. Most of the scenario parks are given to you in the beginning, but to unlock the later ones, you have to reach a certain level in each park. It's tricky. Sadly, you won't gain anything for this except pre-made roller coaster designs, but for people wanting a challenge, go for it. There's different parks for each expansion pack, so you can play all the levels.This game was also important to me because this was my 1st real PC game in 2008, and I made 70+ parks on my crappy old Vista desktop. Too many hours to count on this game, and now I got it on Steam.You thought it stopped with the game? Nope, because out there on the wild internet you can find custom content. Custom coasters, flat rides, and most importantly, custom scenery. These mods make your game look better than with the stock scenery. Mods include coaster supports, lights, catwalks, fences, and much more. Also, they made an invisible ride entrance and exit, so you arn't stuck with the stupid stock ones. There's a wealth of mods out there, and lots of tutorials on how to install them. I will also be providing a link to a Steam guide to all of the mods I use, so you can see the stuff I like.All in all, RCT3 is one of the greatest games out there. If you are new to the RCT series, this game is the easiest to get into, then you can discover the first 2 games. There's also a 4th game in the process of being made, called World. Anything that this game didn't have will be added in World, and that comes to the bad things about this game.First, like the first 2 games, your whole park is like a giant grid system. Each grid block at a certain height will be taken up when you place something there. Although this is great for beginners, it's not that great for people that want to be creative. You just want to move this wall 2 inches to connect to the other wall, but you can't. Second, probably due to the game engine being from 2004, if you zoom away from an object, they have the chance of dissapearing. And also compared to todays standards, everything looks a bit blocky. Depending on your computer likes and dislikes, this game might not even work! If you get this game, you have to be willing to mess with the settings to get the most out of it for your machine.To end this rambling, this game is amazing. Just spend $20 and get it. I got about $35 in RCT3 stuff alone, with getting the base game and expansion packs alone, and then getting this combo copy on Steam. That shows you how much I like this game.9/10 You can charge people to go to the bathroom!			",53,3,15,0,14,0,0

												This isn't a very challanging game but it's a great sandbox. It offers plenty of options for building your park and is suprisingly cinematic at times. You can spend hours and hours designing and beautifying your park or creating tounge-in-cheek rides synched to your favourite(or not) tunes. The terrain tools, building options, and general openess allows the player a lot of freedom to play however they want to, even beyond the confines of 'amusement park simulator'.I build racetracks out of paths and run over my guests with the dune buggy.10/10 who needs NASCAR			",24,0,0,4,5,0,1

												I have had this game since it first came out. 10 years later, It's STILL amazing! My absolute favorite feature of the game is to ride the rides. And by changing the name of one of your peeps to Jonny Watts, you can view your park through that peep's eyes, which allows you to see your park truly come alive. VIPeep challenges are really fun as you have to cater to celebrity guests. It essentially takes everything you love about RCT 1 and 2 and adds a 3D element to it.			",23,6,0,1,3,0,3

												After 20 hours its time for a reviewThis game right off the bat feels nostalgic. I never had the expansions so this is great. The start menu is a bit bland, just un-appealing photos but that doesnt matter.I got into the game and I instantley decided to make a wild west park, after hours of work I had my base park down a coaster and some carnival rides and I was hooked like I used to be. I decided to download some maps and they are great. Some cons are the fact that some coasters are odd to build, an example is on the tilt coaster on one of the special pieces instead of slowing down it keeps moving and crashes. Overall I see no reason not to buy this.Pros-Once you make 1 or 2 good coasters its easy to get the hang of it-Fun to play for hours on end-First person coasters-Great enviornment-Tons of carnival rides, coaster types and food stalls make it different each time you playCons-Like I mentioned some small problems with coasters but nothing major as it can be fixedFinal Grade9.5/10 Great with tiny issues			",21,0,0,5,9,0,0

												Really is a fantastic game. It feels like it is the best game based on making theme parks out there. You are not restricted by restrictions like the other ones and you can make your own rollercoasters and not just place some premade crap. Also all the peeps have there own families and hunger bars so they dont have a 50/50 chance of walking into a shop for no reason. Also there is a heck of alot more customisation than the other games. It does deserve £15.00 but you can get it for about £6.00 with the DLC from other sites.			",151,18,4,10,23,1,2

												This simulation is that, a simulation. To treat it as a game is to treat railway simulator as a game. That said, if you like fairground rides, either have the creativity of building your own coaster or just developing your park so that it's running at peak efficiency, this is for you.having to Juggle selling a baby Zebra in order to go back into profit Vs condemming a baby zebra to abuse in a circus is a much easier decision on a simulation that in real life.Baby Zebra 2014-2015. Rip.Anyway, be careful buying this at full retail, RollerCoaster Tycoon: World is coming out on PC soon with a demon in Aug-sep 15 being shown publically. If it's on offer, snap this up, but do not pay full price due to the fact the next in line is due out soon.:)Tom			",65,5,10,1,23,0,4

This game on modern hardware could do so much more, I really would love to see atari come back with a RCT4. It's limited also, by its old-ness, not allowing parks over a certain size, which is annoying. I'd love to even see this game brought into modern times, same game just adapted to fully take advantage of new hardware, just to really make the game pop again.Amazing game, just please make a new one! :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you are looking for a classical gaming evening with RollerCoasters and wild animals, this is the game! Together with entertaining gameplay and the charm of its old school graphic, , RTC 3 will provide the feeling of that you are in charge of the adventure park irl. I highly recommend this game to people who are not that familiar to this kind of games. WARNING! The game may have various side effects on relationships with loved ones. It is addictive.

												I grew up playing RTC games, Loved playing them all. RTC3 is probably my favourite. Building your very own theme park based on selective themes such as; Horror, Fantasy, or Western just makes it all the fun rather than having a generic theme park. A good sandbox game for those who enjoy playing games with no limits, or just enjoy building and creating stuff. There is also campaign mode which I love as well. Having to complete certain things for a pre-made theme park, adding rides etc to it. This is game is for everyone and I reccommend this game.			",24,6,1,8,7,0,0

												This has always been a personal favorite of mine. I first received the game as a disc a while back and I was devistated when my laptop was dropped with the disc inside. I never found time to go off and buy it again it was never i stores when I actually remembered to go look either. I finally found it on steam and I was so excited.The amount of customization for each ride is great. Everything from color to complete rollercoaster designs. Pricing the food is always fun as well. Making coasters fly off the tracks is a great way to pass the time If I dont feel like making a serious park. This will forever be one of my favorite games. I remember the first time I began playing and the rollercoaster did a loop on my scream I could only smile. The same look I had when I opened now after finding it again.			",30,0,0,4,8,0,2

												I grew up playing RCT2, and RCT3 has been an utter delight for me. The merging of art, practical design and economic simulation makes for game that is as challenging as you want it to be, and tons of fun to play.Career mode gives this otherwise totally leisurely game a set of reasonably attainable goals that leave plenty of room for creative choice while at the same time pushes you to think creatively to make your coasters pack as much fun as possible into as little space as possible for as few dollars (or yen) as possible.Or, you could just kill them all as most reviewers suggest. Either way, this game is great and you should definitely make it a part of your collection if you can get into building sick roller coasters and themed parks/rides. the ability to add your own music to each ride or at loudspeakers anywhere you want in the park is a really nice touch. The ride-cam is probably the best part of the game.9.5/10, Awesome game. -0.5 for framerate issues but my computer is crap anyway so no biggie.			",11,4,0,0,5,0,1

												I have had this game since it first came out. 10 years later, It's STILL amazing! My absolute favorite feature of the game is to ride the rides. And by changing the name of one of your peeps to Jonny Watts, you can view your park through that peep's eyes, which allows you to see your park truly come alive. VIPeep challenges are really fun as you have to cater to celebrity guests. It essentially takes everything you love about RCT 1 and 2 and adds a 3D element to it.			",23,6,0,1,3,0,3

""there must be a simulator I can play that can let me live my dream""... then you play this game again.... Run..

												By now, this is an older game and one of the top classics in the genre, so a review is hardly worthwhile. Even so, two things worth noting: This game is definitely worth the price, since it includes all the DLC/Addons. If you can get it on sale, even better. The game has tons of different rides, terrain, coasters, etc. Many things are customizable (coasters especially), but several rides (Ferris Wheel, for example) are static and can't be changed (besides colors).Overall, a ton of fun.

It combines designing rollercoasters and theme parks with strategy, that's never too hard but always challenging. Not only that, but it's gorgeous looking too. I only wish they'd release the previous games on Mac on Steam too, would love to play those again. 10/10, 5/5, 100%, whatever your preferred rating system is.			",12,6,0,0,6,0,3

												I've been playing RCT3 for YEARS. I probably have something like over 5,000+ hours combined! I love this game so damn much. Some people prefer the older RCT games but this was was my favorite. New players may have a hard time getting into it though, just like any old game. This version is slightly buggy though, but nothing game-breaking. Give it a chance, try it out before you buy it.			",110,14,0,23,17,1,2

												This has been a go-to game for me for years. It's a bit dated but it's a wonderful sandbox full of creative potential. You can build coasters and other fun rides and then actually ride them in your park. Expect this: The lack of an undo button (except when building coasters, THANK GOD) can get frustrating, especially for beginners. Still worth it. This never bores me.			",70,21,3,18,37,3,31

												This is it, the best tycoon game of your childhood. You remember that day when you got it. When you thought it would be like your Sim city or railroad tycoon simulartors.How you were so grateful to be wrong.Hours skunk into RollerCoaster Tycoon 2. The extra content was ever so worth it, the graphics were questionable at best, but nobody care about graphics in those days. It was the idea of all these little people, and there wallets, and your noble quest to seperate the two.Now it's here. It's the upgraded version. And it is glorious. Enjoy my friends, for you will not be seen for some time after this purchase. Call it a hunch.			",33,7,1,13,15,0,7

												GOOD THINGS: This game is old...VERY old. But! that doesn't mean it isn't good! RCT3 is a game where you can design the amusment park of your dreams! There is almost eveything you can imagine in RCT3, there's almost a thousand different decorations, rides, walkways etc. that you can place down! BAD THINGS: This game doesn't have so good of graphics. Even if you have a good computer, RCT3 doesn't want to use what it  can of your computer so it can be laggy. I DO NOT agree on the price much.			",71,8,0,8,10,1,4

												I definitely reccomend this to fans of older RollerCoaster Tycoon games. It isn't complicated to play, it has some pretty fun moments, and you can pretty much create the park of your dreams. If you do get bored you can rain terror on your guests by having rollercoasters cars flighing off tracks or going straight into the pathways and running over guests. And did I mention you can go on your rides with the fricken in-ride view? All in all this game's awesome.10/10			",170,27,5,17,9,0,5

It actually has Strategy involved, so its not just a Sim game like most might think.			",1777,705,53,207,196,20,305

												I've been playing RCT franchise on and off since it first came out when I was a child, mostly with a disk. Recently, I picked it back up with Steam. Clearly, my hours played don't truly represent how much I've been playing this game for the last decade or so. A lot of reviews will be by people who do not have the patience and imagination to really get into it. There are a lot of complaints about the cartoonish graphics to RCT3. A lot of people see this and start just crashing the coasters a lot and then say ""doesn't replay well,"" or try to do a little tinkering with the program files without really knowing how the game works and then say it's really buggy. Ignore these reviews, if you have patience it is probably the best Theme Park simulator out there, especially for those who haven't played theme park simulators very much before. It's obviously not built for the hardware that most gamers have today, so it can be a little buggy if you don't know what you're doing. But that's not the fault of the game, and with a tiny bit of tinkering and careful patience it runs excellently even on my Windows 8.1 64-bit OS, a SSD, and an Intel I-7 processor. The best way to play the game is to get connected to the fantastic community that has been playing it for so long. The RCT3 community on Steam is, to say the least, not very good. The best place to see this game's real potential is to go to the following sites:http://rctgo.com/http://www.shyguysworld.com/Much of the community is beginning to move on in the last year or so thanks to the anticipated release of RCTWorld later this year, and the much acclaimed Theme Park Studio. However, RCTWorld won't likely be as well-supported as RCT3 has been for the last decade and Theme Park Studio is not the best for beginners to the genre. Regardless of the competition, RCT3 is still a great use of your $20 if you're interested in getting into this genre.The best way to play the game is to download the massive collection of third-party add-ons, typically called Custom Scenery (or CS). It can be overwhelming, but like similar old games with a community following (such as Sim City 4), CS is surprisingly well organized. For example:http://www.customscenerydepot.com/cslist/In short, after a decade I still keep coming back to this game. It's definitely worth your money and time if you do your homework and learn the ins and outs of this game well.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Simply put, this is my favorite game of all time. It was one of the first games I ever played, and it was on a CD from the library which I got a week at a time. I played it each week for many weeks. Nevermind what Steam says, I probably have 300+ hours into this game, and that was before the expansion packs. I don't think that it really needs to be explained, other than that the UI works nicely, the game runs nicely, the graphics fit the style, the music is fantastic, and the game is super easy to understand. Here's the thing: The game was amazing, then I discovered the pools DLC, then I discovered the animals DLC, and then I discovered the amazing online community and downloadable custom scenery. The game is the best I have ever played. However, if you are used to good graphics or lots of action, this game is not for you.			",33,6,0,5,9,1,7

This was my money maker for years (in-game). THEN PETA comes and take my lion, and has the nerve to fine ME 45,000, for not feeding him?!

												This game is great. It involves strategy and creativity, and it has a sandbox mode as well. There are a variety of campaigns that you can play. The other RCT games were good, but this one is just as good if not better. Its a little more challenging, but you have a lot more options to choose from, such as the fireworks display and water/wild rides. You can also use the camera mode to view the ride in first person.

												I played the first one , second one , and third one . I think the third oen was best and next the first one and lastly, second one.  The new rollercoaster cam is good as long as you dont look at other people (The people in this game looks weired) The graphic other than the peeps , are not great but fair enough . Just dont expect too much .The new stuff like firework and laser show seems really intriging but personally it was too hard to make one. The game also retains most of fun that present on previous one. Building rollercoaster , menaging the park , or else .The co op or multiplayer would be great but it doesnt have one. 8.5 / 10 good game if you loved the first game. and if you havent played other rollercoaster game it is worth give it a try unless you really dont like the simulation  / sandbox games.

It seemed like they added a lot of cool features from what I initially saw but they sacrificed interface quality for a more gimmicky feeling game. What is the point of a simulator management game without a good interface. Buy RTC 2, the low grade 3D, zoo animals, and 1st person cameras just aren’t worth the aggravation.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This has become one of my favourite games very quickly. And it has good reason to...RCT3 allows you to build amazing and stupid roller coasters as much as you want to with a lot of customisation, including how fast the coasters go and what colour each part is.  The on-ride camera is an amazing feature which lets you see how good your roller coasters really are (and make you feel sick if you make them go as fast as I do!).The game may be old but it has aged well, the graphics might not look top-notch but it's not too noticeable. And I find that the game takes a long time too load (not everyone seems to get this problem).Overall, this is a game worth spending money on, it provides hours of entertainment and a huge choice of stuff to do.

												I love this game. RollerCoaster Tycoon 3: Platinum adds the great idea of riding your rides after building them. It brings the world of RCT into 3D. The rides are great and are really fun to build. The AI of the people isn't great and there isn't a lot of scenery choices, but the rides make up for it. They improved the sandbox by making it its own thing instead of having to make a new custom scenario just for it. There are multiple carrer choices that each have one objective but after you complete the first, it makes it tougher by making you expand your goal even more. If you have trouble understanding how to play the game, there is a tutorial mode that will help you on your way to becoming the best rollercoaster park designer that you can be. I would fully recommend this game to anyone who has the time and patiece to make your park look great and making your rollercoasters amazing. This is one of my favorite games, which may seem sad, but it is that good. If you have the money to buy this game, get it right away.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you like simple 3D graphics and rollercoasters this title is for you. Your objective is to build a theme park that will gather money and be secessuful, hence why it's called tycoon. It is simple and fun. As an add on Wild and Soaked add more viritity in building coasters in addition to buildonmg a bit of water park and zoo to the game. How ever the Zoo part of it seems a little bit lacking, there is still the apect of owning and treating the animals. Despite it's blocky feel and looks there is too much in this game to give a total bad review.I do agree with most people when saving the peeps in this tycoon are a bit too blocky and cartoonish, but consinderwhen it was released it was good for avage computers to handle. anything less than this game reomends it it forces you to make a rather lengthy purchace. Lenthy, probly not the best word to desribe it, but it'll work, mostly becuase of the high 3D Graphicail demands(not that much for todays machines) you could be out $150-$300, not really that big of puchace for some people other.. meh.For what this game ment to me when I had the orginal copies(still do disk is scratched and beond repair) it ment alot to have the third addtion to the seris becuase it was advanced for the time being. i still have the old tycoons 1 & 2 with wacky worlds, i never got all of the add ons becuase i couldn't find them in stores. This game is just a huge upgrade from both of them, never mind they got rid a few apect(more the nessary ones then the latter ""You Know what I mean."")I aplogies for any mispellings, am am english, i have a hard time sometimes typing and making words  how i would make them sound.

RollerCoaster Tycoon has been a bonding experience with friends ever since I was a little kid, and the amount of content you get in this plantinum package means that you'll be playing it for hours on end.Like building roller coasters? Wanna run a theme park? This is one of the best theme park simulation games available, if it has become a little dated graphically.			",106,29,1,21,10,0,2

												RCT3, although a bit buggy, is a great park simulator game. It is very easy to pick up (and has tutorials for newcomers), and the Sandbox mode allows you to create large, expansive parks.Positives:-3D Graphics are great-Custom Music-Fun scenarios-Unlimited creation (I created an underground park, indoor park, and have seen creations such as cruise ships and cities)-Coaster cam is funNegatives:-A bit buggy-Runs slow on large parks (runs a lot better on Steam than from disk)-Limited scenery options-Unrealistic supports/scenery (download a scenery set of supports for more realism)-Lack of gentle ridesAlso note that I have many more than 12 hours on this game, as I originally purchased this game on release day, as well as its expansions, before purchasing it on Steam years later.

												A classic. The most in-depth amusement park simulator out there, RCT3 is a game that really should be in every Steam member's library. The ability to micromanage every milimeter of your park (and the ability to keep things mostly in broad strokes instead) is something that most can appreciate, and the sandbox mode is fun. I imagine for a lot of people the fun will mostly be had in designing their own parks-slash-horrible murder cesspools, but there are three well-made single player campaigns. The difficulty curve is all over the place (The notoriously nigh-impossible La La Land scenario is somewhere in the middle of the main campaign), but the design of the parks are nice.

												So yeah, Roller Coaster Tycoon. What can you even say about it really? It's a classic game series that pretty much boosted tycoon games (Other than Sim City) to more heights. So with the passage of time, Infograms we're bought out by atari and the original creator, Chris Sawyer, not working on it anymore, Atari tried to make there own RCT game; and this is how Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 came to be known as... an okay game.So I guess I have to say the pros and cons about it, soooooooooooooooooooooo...The game is now in 3D, and it works pretty well. The only real problem is trying to turn the camera up and down trying to find the perfect angle; It just resets and goes back to a semi top down perspective. The main focus of the game is that you can RIDE the RIDES, and you can kinda ride the rides, but not in the people or ""peep's"" point of view. Instead It's on the cart's point of view. Because the rides have feelings too you know. The gameplay is you're tipical tycoon game. But don't go building your rollercoaster of death and spooky scary skeletons, you see this game has an antagonist. The Park Inspector. He hate's everything fun and will make you throw out your anger on the keyboard. You're roller coaster is a little bit unsafe? SHUT IT DOWN! Water slide landing in the wrong pool? SHUT IT DOWN! He really makes the game less fun and you can't take him out. Also, you can't kill people in the game. I guess it makes the game more casualized since there's no worry of screwing up your coaster. Oh and one more thing to add. The zoo expansion is just Zoo Tycoon so just ask someone how Zoo Tycoon plays and that's RCT 3's Zoo expansion in a nutshell. The Water expansion just adds pools which don't really need an explanation. Same with Water Slides.So yeah, It's an okay game but not as good as the other games in the series. Really, if it was it's own game without the RCT game I think I would have liked it more, not to say It's a bad game. But with the price, I don't recommend it. Wait for a sale to get it, trust me you'll thank me later.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm amazed they never made a sequel to this. This is by far the most in depth theme park construction kit ever. It gives you the option of using easy prebuilt rides and scenery if you only feel like moving forward in the Career mode, but it also allows you to use an insane amount of custom tools and options if you feel like adding a quick flair to something or even if you want to build something special and unique from the ground up. The sandbox mode let's you experiment with or without restraint to that end.The atmosphere in this game needs to be seen and heard to be understood, it's a work of gesamtkunstwerk. Everything in this game is unified into that mode of play that only a day at a theme park seems to have, whether that's in the middle of summer without a cloud in the sky or in the middle of October when it drizzles often and every theme park brings out it's vampire costumes and spider webs. The music is especially expressive of this theme.If that's not enough, RCT 3: Platinum gives you the option to use music and pictures from your own library to use seamlessly in the park! If you just want to play a light-hearted tycoon game it's in there, if you want to spend time building a roller coaster that weaves in and out of a pirate ship while it's under attack by another pirate ship that also has a syncronized seperate roller coaster in it that uses a unique soundtrack and an accompanying fireworks display, it's also in there with tutorials. Be careful though, after a while of the former you might find yourself getting sucked into the latter.			",239,26,2,20,35,3,44

												Without a single doubt, RCT3 is a time consuming, coaster building, amusement gaining good time. Though a few things that made RCT2 unique are not present in this one, there's still more than enough to settle for. The game comes with all the expansion packs; Soaked, and Wild, both with an acceptable amount of new features. The transition to 3D looks rather dated up close, but from a distance it appears to look similar to some tycoon games on the new market today, but of course this would be the least graphically advanced of the bunch. Though campaigns are laughably shorter than the previous titles, this feels like a good move because something the previous installments lacked was the ability to keep the player caring on a single map with the limited choices to make for around four hours on a first run. Instead, you'll be on a map for around a good hour and that's the perfect amount of time you need before it begins to get dull. When you move to another map, the experience is always renewed because of how many new options you obtain. Sandbox mode is here for new players to experiment around with endless money and restrictions, so you can jump right in and learn for yourself. Tutorial sessions are also available. Replayability is a sweet refreshment to this game because the Platinum edition itself is around a good 35 hours, and with the ability to be creative on sandbox, complete all the tycoon challenges, and the map editor (you heard me right!) the game will never get old. If you can get over it's childish appeal, (and as an ""unmentioned"" comment, the land editing mechanics) it's here to give you literally endless hours of solid entertainment.8.5/10			",174,23,6,7,12,1,6

												Really big fan of the Tycoon style games and this was the series that started it all for me. It gets the Platinum part from including both expansion packs giving more then enough rides, stalls, paths and scenary to work with. If you've never played Rollercoaster Tycoon before and ejoy building things or Tycoon type games this is a one stop shop.			",236,105,28,41,21,5,50

												This is my alltime favorite rollercoaster builder. There's a tutorial to learn, sandboxmode and a campaign. Graphics are outdated but who cares. Its all about the gameplay and this game brings out the best thinkable gameplay for building a rollercoaster park combined with soaked attractions and wildlife attractions. Pros:- Freedom to build your own coasters or swimming paradise how you want it.- Graphics are from 2006 and most computers can run this game.- This Ultimate versoin contains RT3 + Soaked + Wildlife = a lot of value for a low priceCons:- The guided tutorials are semi guided and the interaction between the steps and the actions you perform are not all automated like we see in games that are more recent.- Graphics feel outdated compared to what's out on the marketI highly recommend this game if you are into themeparks and such. It's still a lot better then newer games that have better graphics but a whole different approach on gameplay and the lack of freedom to build things the way you want. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This game on modern hardware could do so much more, I really would love to see atari come back with a RCT4. It's limited also, by its old-ness, not allowing parks over a certain size, which is annoying. I'd love to even see this game brought into modern times, same game just adapted to fully take advantage of new hardware, just to really make the game pop again.Amazing game, just please make a new one! :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of my favorite games of all time! After completing everything in the game I assure you it's definitely satisfying. RollerCoaster Tycoon fans seem to maybe not like this game but there are settings to please those players back in the early 00s. The game excels in pretty much every aspect such as improved objective structure, VIPs, Peep Editors, and Coasters such as the Splitting coaster and Tilt coaster (Check those out). There's also now a sandbox mode so you can truly do whatever the hell you want. People are scared of bears.			",57,27,0,0,14,2,4

												One of the most addictive RTS games in the Tycoon franchise. Though the graphics feel dated, the mechanics are so immersive you quickly set the visuals aside as you're pulled further and further into the life of living at an amusement park. Hundreds of different rides, stands, objects and items, you can construct your own buildings using thousands of in-game pieces, even orchestrate a complex fireworks/laser show. Create an intense coaster, and then ride it thanks to the coaster cam. With so many different things up for offer, so many variations and so many gameplay modes, you'll never get bored with it. If you've ever wanted to build your very own rollercoaster and/or have any interest in RTS games (or played either of the previous two installments), look no further. 9 / 10			",272,69,31,22,45,3,23

Graphics are old, music is repetitive, but the gameplay is great and posibilities in creating an inferno for your guests are infinite.

												Honestly I didn't find this as fun as the first RCT, and I my animal enclosures are always terrible. Still a fun game, however.			",82,20,2,26,20,2,11

												You can trap people on an island. Or load up a full train and send it off an unfinished track. Of course those are horrible things. So dont do that. Instead build a park that would shame Walt and be successful. Build a rollercoaster that rivals mans modern architectural and design masterpieces. Or dont do that and just play in sandbox and move the janitor to clean up more puke.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I used to LOVE this game when I was younger, I got it on sale and it's still SO MUCH FUN! Yeah the graphics aren't as good as some of the newer games I have but it's lot's of fun to just relax in sandbox mode and build fun roller coasters c: and if you are up for a challenge those levels with budgets are actually pretty hard. So yeah, awesome game it's tons of fun!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game has been around for a long while, as I remember growing up playing the other Roller Coaster Tycoon games, the second game being my favorite to play until this came out. Although the graphics are not ""up to par"" as it is expected for this generation of graphics, it still works fairly well on Windows 7/8 and quite fluid on non-gaming computers. (I use a 1.8 GHz processor and this game goes about 50 fps... big thumbs up from me!)Plus, you can ""kill"" people with roller-coasters.Infinity/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Loved this game when I was on a Windows as a kid! Now that I have a Mac, I'm so glad they made a port! It's just like I remembered! Altho, I definitely need to use a mouse instead of my touchpad. Such a fun game! Sandbox mode was/is the only why I play this terrific game, haha!			",32,9,0,4,7,0,4

												Wow, this game... Sure, it has flaws, sure, the grid is a little annoying but once you get around those flaws, it is so amazing! This game gives you management, strategy, simulation, and yet there is still SO much creativity involved in the game. Games like this are hard to find these days. This game will go perfect beside RTC1 and 2. Games like this will leave you addicted for months if not years! I used to play this game off steam since i got the CD in 2006 and it played over 1000 hours and never got bored! This is one of my favorite games of all time!			",147,19,2,7,19,0,13
