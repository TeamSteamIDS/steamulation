												I bought this game because years ago I was a fan of the Impressions Games city-building series, particularly Caesar and Pharoah.  This game builds on the same premise, with the building of cities in Rome while raising armies to attack and defend.  Like Pharoah, it is a blend of city-building simulation and RTS except there is a stronger implementation of the RTS elements here.  Visually, the game looks pretty good.  Not the best graphics by modern standards, but bounds above the old Impressions games.  The biggest problem with this game is that it's a lot to learn and take in very quickly.  There are some tutorials for that, though.  It's not the steepest learning curve, it's nothing compared to some of the Paradox games, but it is a game that requires you take the time to learn it.

												I will always go back to this game to loose yet again, to watch my buildings burn to the ground in utter shame. For how ever often I leave this milestone in gaming history, it always pulls be back for more.Is it the feeling of playing God, or just those wonderful animations of buildings popping up?The game has a lot of depth and can catch you out if your not quick enough to see a crysis looming up.I had a pig, grape, weat and somthing else farm going and yet still my buildings were burnt because of food not being varied enough!? I warmly recommend this game because it grasps hold of those simple human needs and pulls on your emosional strings so well ;-]Tip Do both tutorials!			",124,61,10,14,24,1,7

												I love this game (clearly by the time I've spent playing). I like the way resources are handled. Mainly, I love the properties and abilities which carry over from mission to mission. Basically, as you complete secondary missions, you accrue PERSONAL wealth and experience. The wealth allows you to buy properties which give permanent resource bonuses to every story map you play on. If you liked the old Sierra city builders, you will probably enjoy this.			",264,52,5,49,80,2,70

												To all negative reviews saying that buildings catch on fire too often: learn to play the game. As long as your population has all its needs satisfied, you will never have criminals. I've played the campaign multiple times and never ONCE had a criminal light a building on fire.7.5/10			",10,0,0,1,3,0,7

												I started playing this game again recently, and discovered how fun the Campaigns are to play. Previously I had only used the Free Build mode. The Good	Campaign SystemThe campaign is simple. It has a simple reward system which gives you money and talents at the end of each task, which you can then use to buy estates or upgrade your city building skills, giving you resource advantges before you move on to the next task. Quite a simple mechanic, but one which adds just enough interest to make the game long lasting fun, and which fits in well with the overall gamepaly. GameplayGrand Ages Rome has a nice balance between complexity and easy of play. It is in some ways similar to Anno 1404, the main difference being the campaign system and the fact that production buildings in Grand Ages can only be placed where there is an appropriate natural resource. This latter difference makes it a bit more challenging than the Anno series, in my opinion. There is an overlay system that allows you to see the state of the city's satisification with regard to food, entertainment and religion, so you can see at once the effect of placing a building in a particular area. The buildings have a simple upgrade system that depends on your level of research.  There is also a simple trade system allows trading with a choice of towns trading at different prices. The simplicty of this system fits the gameplay perfectly. While it is quite easy to create a small settlements in a peaceful area, creating and maintaining one that is periodically attacked by barbarians offers a greater challenge. Fighting is simple, but again, I think it has the right balance in the overall gameplay. You can recruit units from certain segments of the population, and build training and upgrade centres for them. Oh, and it has walls too. The upcoming Grand Ages: Medieval, doesn't. In fact this is one of the things that has prompted me to write this review. Walls are good! We need walls in games like these. Rome also has towers with slits in them that automatically fire arrows at attackers. I love this feature although it is easy to abuse if you need to repel an attacking army.GraphicsOne thing I really like about Grand Ages: Rome are the stunning graphics. Even in 2015, the graphics still look good when the settings are cranked up. The Roman architecture is accurately done and looks beautiful close up, with astonishing attention to detail. The camera has this nice feature that allows you to zoom in to street level and get an impression of what the city looks like if you are actually a citizen living in it, allowing full movement through the city.  This is another difference to Anno 1404's postcard view. The way the city comes alive with perfectly animated little figures is also very well done.  From a distance, your city really does look like a Roman city, and you can't help but take screenshots of it. The Not so Good...I'm very positive to this game but there are a few areas that could have been done better...Camera ControlsAs I already mentioned, I love the fact that you can zoom into to street level and see things from a citizen's point of view, but the camera controls are clunky. Also, zooming right out switches to a static 3D map view which gives an overview of the area you are building in. However, it is not possible to do anything when in this zoomed out mode. I think the game could have benefitted from having camera controls that are similar to the classic Total War series.Research One thing I think was too easy was carrying out research. All it requires is a school and a simple house for teachers to live in, both of which you can build early on in a game. Libraries and Philosophers Academies aren't necessary, as they offer only the same research possibilities as schools. Why not have the more advanced buildings that offer new and different research possibilities, as in the C&C games?Conclusion: Grand Ages: Rome is a good solid city building game that looks stunning, and I'm sure you will enjoy it all the more if you have an interest in Ancient Rome. In fact I'd say that it's the best Roman city building game there is. ",33,13,1,10,10,0,9

												I have played this game ever since it came out,my steam playing time doesn't seem like it,I honestly had this game from a non-steam retail for a long time,but here I am nowThis game has a quite impressive graphic in its time,although its nothing compare to nowaday's games,but I have to say its gameplay feature might surpass most of these days's city building game.Some might think this game is an amazing RTS to be games,like the big guy series such as Total War,and then end up disappointing because they can't keep their city building from burning the first few minutes of gameplay and few enemies around.To all complainer,learn how to play this game properly! This is a city building,not RTS.The game is hard for beginner,it has strategy element,but it doesn't have much to do with military aspect of this game.The strategy I'm talking about here is city planning.Beginner who has their trouble with building large city might need to consider this,its not a base building game,so they can't just place block of building all they want and expect the city itself can adjust to what they want.And they end up having building being burned down by high criminal rate because of poor management.It takes city planning to makes the best city out of the base resources you have,the game is all about management,so anyone who gave a bad review about this game because of themselves failing to take a city challenge and start blaming it on the developer,they need to learn how to play.Multiplayer is pretty much dead,so I can't argue with bad reviewer about this one,I myself also has issue with Multiplayer.First off,city building game is a time consuming game,but there is no multiplayer save feature,everyone end up having to play over just because their connection is unstable or the game might somehow crashed during the match.Secondly,the base server of this game seem unstable,I can't keep a match long enough that can decide the winner just because of network issue.Other than that,this is a pretty good game.

If you liked old days of caesar city builder, or pharaoh, this is a good game. It have even more history and culture on Rome than Rome 2! Well, TBH Rome 2 is pretty bad and blunt.

												This is a surprisingly solid game in the out of fashion genre of city builders, most comparable to the Caesar/Pharoah/Emperor series.  It's got a weird learning curve since there are a shockingly large variety of different mechanics behind resources but once it's understood it's quite fun.  There's a lot of content and a long campaign of reasonably bite sized missions.			",95,36,0,33,22,1,35

												This game came out on steam in 2009, it is currently my favourite game on steam - for this type of strategy / city builder.For me, Grand Ages: Rome is better than most other games, for it being developed in 2009 it brings a refreshing and a gripping addiction that even the AoE or even the TW series eventually runs dry on.------------------ Pros: +Addicting+Extensive Campaign+Collective Campaign Missions (keeps your character stats and doesn't reset the skills)+Multiplayer is constant and rarely lags+Resources and trading are handled amazingly with various tactics you could use to disrupt your enemy with minimal casualties+Unlike other boring and frustrating city builders or strategy games, GA: Rome throws at you random barbarian raids and other situations (riots, natural disasters, plaque etc) which you don't see coming and should wisely plan for. +Technology tree and skill tree are extensive and meaningfull (none of the upgrades are worthless and they all help expand your colony)+Graphics are superb+Frame rate only drops when you spam buildings in a huge city+Frame rate is mostly constant^+ Plays better than AoE series -----yes I just said that  Cons: -No enemy factions in custom scenarios-Maps sometimes feel empty and there is no real need for building walls (other than keeping riots at bay)-Sadly no way to make custom maps (not any that I have found)-Tying into the one above; no modding community to alleviate any problems-No difference in family unit trees or buildings------------------I probably could have thought of more Pros and Cons, but these are what stand out for me;my final verdict is a  7/10 or 8/10  because the game surpasses most 2014/2015 games in its field. P.S. For Modders : This game deserves poetry;If you mod and you know it don't ******** blow it, so set up a community so this game doesn't die as sudden as AC: Unity. ",36,0,0,8,12,0,15

												Grand Ages: Rome is very unique as far as sequels go. The follow-up to Imperium Romanum looks and sounds very similar, but features entirely different systems under the hood. It's a bit off-putting at first because they're not necessarily improvements, just very different. There's no clear superior between them, but a little time with this game will is bound to hook you for a good long while.The meat of Grand Ages is its campaign, featuring a wealth of scenarios that challenge you to raise and manage a Roman colony somewhere in the empire. You generally start with a single outpost, and from that singular beginning expand with homes, farms, shops, arenas, theaters, and more. Every scenario has a very clear objective that you must accomplish, this time without the quirks and surprises of Imperium Romanum's tablet system. As you provide services to your plebeians you gain the resources needed to build more prosperous homes, which in turn can manage more complex services. It's a very simple hierarchy of structures to work through, so most of your concern will be on finding space for them all.What won't be much of a concern is managing your resources, because they're on a much more streamlined system than in the previous game. Instead of producing and stockpiling goods, each resource building provides a permanent, static number of resources for your settlement. That means building a logging camp produces 10 logs, full stop. When you build a new building, however, it doesn't subtract from that number. If a house says it needs 4 logs and 4 bricks, you just need to have more than that threshold to build however many you want. What DOES subtract from your resource pools are upkeep costs, usually 1 or 2 units of a few resources per building.Trading also reduces your thresholds in exchange for denarii, currency needed for construction and upkeep. Money works more traditionally, being earned over time and spent directly from your coffers. You'll need to pay a bit of attention to your economy so as to not go bankrupt, but even if you fall into the red you just enter a warning state where you have ten minutes to get back into the black. Your settlement can enter a lot of interesting states like this by building in certain ways, including building frenzies that speed up construction, divine blessings that improve services, and more. It's a nice touch that encourages you to find different ways to expand, and can really change up your strategies.Combat plays a larger role in Grand Ages, but units are a little easier to build and command, and the combat is more interesting with additions like experience levels. You can access military and other improvements through the research system, which simply requires a school to start with. The campaign also has a really cool progression feature in your character, who can level up and earn family wealth between scenarios. These resources can be used to unlock skills that improve your buildings or military, or buy estates that provide you with additional starting resources. This system does a lot to expand your options, even allowing you to find shortcuts past particularly troublesome resources.There's a lot of improvements to take in, but not without a few drawbacks. As streamlined as the new resource system is, it responds much worse to surprises than the old one. Should you lose buildings to fires or angry gods (yes that can happen, build lots of temples!) when you are low on a particular resource, you might not have a clear path to rebuilding them. Fires are also much more common because riots now guarantee that at least a handful of buildings will be destroyed, so keeping your people happy is crucial this time around. You may also find yourself bee-lining to certain buildings even if they're not optimal for your city because of scenario objectives and the hard caps your resource thresholds provide.It's just as pretty a game as Imperium Romanum, and shares the same quality audio and soundtrack to enjoy. The camera is a little harder to get nice screencaps with, but they're worth doing with the more detailed buildings. In the end, I can't really say which is the better game. Imperium Romanum has a little more personality with its individual citizens, and a little more flexibility with its resource stockpiles. Grand Ages: Rome feels more streamlined and polished, and adds some really interesting progression systems. Fans of more abstracted builders like SimCity will probably enjoy this one more, but no matter which you pick I'm confident you'll find something to like.			",488,212,8,71,62,7,65

												Caeser III with new graphics. Ya.. Above sentence is what I thought about this game after playing 6 missions in about 10 hours.I took my time playing each map and to complete the 2 singleplayer storyline it will probably around 60-80 hours.Problem is this game really didn't offer up anything new in the game serie and after 6 missions of managing city and strature radius I am already losing interest in it.So I will put the rest of the game on backlog and when I will come back to it.. I don't know at all.Graphics, music and interface are quite well done and can be controled with minimum effect. Difficulty is quite simple, If you make a mistake for building radius just demolish and reset up.7/10 and will only recommend to city building fan.			",2441,943,81,289,309,25,343

It introduces 'Flow Resources' to the genre and is a welcome change. It has all the features of similar games and is pretty stable today, 2016 in Windows 10.The setting is enjoyable and there is a long Campaign.

												Haemimont Games worked on a trilogy: Glory of the Roman Empire, Imperium Romanum and Grand Ages: Rome. In Spain and Italy, these games are known as Imperium Civitas I - III.I still play them all to this date as they are all very unique. You can find Imperium Romanum and Grand Ages: Rome here on steam.While Glory of the Roman Empire and Imperium Romanum work on a system based on slaves transporting goods and individuals working, Grand Ages: Rome uses a macro system where a building produces a fix number of products  and individuals don't have names anymore. If you don't follow the tutorials, you may end up having the city burning down because you didn't really understand how it works. This is really important.I highly recommend Grand Ages: Rome for it's huge replayabily, superb graphics, a very long an interesting campaign and nice music. And if you still haven't enough, take a look at Imperium Romanum.			",13,1,0,10,34,0,72

												Brilliant little city builder with plenty of missions and combat elements while being rather beautiful to boot. If you don't want to strive for building perfect layouts the game lets you just focus on the missions, though those who do are rewarded adequately for their hard work. Big Pros:It's quick to jump in and out of because you're not weighed down by needless micromanagement. Has quite a few missions and side objectives (especially with addons) which are replayable. You can level up your personal profile for perks to aid you in said missions. City layout is completely customiseable and if you're not a big fan of fighting it won't weigh you down either.Big Cons:Lack of micromanagement and resource allocation might put off players looking for complicated game to play. Some maps are repeated in missions and have limited space. Combat is limited too. The only real challenge once you defeat enemy AI is your own mistakes during city building or achieving / racing the clock on objectives.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really enjoy strategy and city builder games but this one is unique in many ways. For an older game it really does look very nice. It has minor RTS features, but they are much more about flavor, than any sort of challenge.  walking your roman troops through the city is fun, but not really a combat challenge by any means. to me the game is much more about just making grand cities, than anything else. the missions give you unique maps to use, so you can make your cities in a varriety of ways. Some maps are absolutly huge too and it becomes a challenge to really fill the map. The game also gives you the option of making a leader with all the points at the start of the game, so you can play through the campaign with less challenge, but the ablity to make much larger cities. In many ways the game is just about making grand Roman cities.. and i'm ok with that. I find it an enjoyable city builder for the casual fan, or even the die hard that is just looking for something fun.  Get the Gold pack, as the expansion just adds lots more of a good thing, letting you make bigger cities through the perks, and adds many new buildings and maps.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not quite sure about the comparisons to classics like Caesar and Pharoh. Those games had much, much different mechanics! In those games, your strategy revolves around road and building placement, but you'll find zero roads here. Grand Ages: Rome reminds me of the game Children of the Nile, which I'm sure almost no one remembers. You'll find yourself free to build as you like, and where you like, but if you build too hastily or don't pay close enough attention to your resources your city will, quite literally, go down in flames. Angry plebs are pyromaniac plebs!Some things about the game bother me and are incredibly frustrating, like the tight material constraints. It's very easy to overbuild and find yourself in a hole you can't escape. I also made the mistake of leaving ONE house without a job for a whole four minutes and the angry residents decided to burn down my outpost, which was an immediate game over. It is incredibly frustrating when there's no countermeasure to messing up. If you mess up, you lose, which sucks. Because games like this, no matter how 'simple' they may seem, definitely have a learning curve.I feel like the game tries to channel parts of Caesar, especially with the overworld map and campaign... but doesn't quite hit the mark. On its own, it is an enjoyable game... just beware angry citizens and their stupid torches. Seriously. If they don't get their entertainment, they'll burn this mother to the GROUND!

												Very fun city building game with limited military aspects.You spend most of your time building your city and managing resources and needs. Every building consumes and produces resources and they work off of each other. Houses require certain services to be near them depending on the class of the citizens. There is also trading and crime and popularity and all that stuff to manage.If you are patient the combat is easy because you can build up your military and then just crush all the barbarians on the map. You can also draw the enemies to your towers and watch them die to hails of arrows. The only stressful missions are when the enemies assault your town, but it's easy enough to deal with it with good defenses. Overall the military part of the game is very simple as there aren't a lot of commands you can give your men and positioning hardly matters. The real fun is city designing.On a technical level the game is very nicely designed. Graphics look nice, and once your town gets going you can zoom down into the city and watch your little citizens walking to work or the store, fights happening at the arena, people preaching at the temple, etc. The downside is I have had the game crash and even freeze my computer sometimes (it is an old PC though).I'd like to point something out if you buy this: I have come across a lot of people on the internet complaining that their buildings constantly catch fire and they can't do anything. This happens because of crime or buildings being left unattended.To stop general deterioration make sure every workplace has employees.To stop crime you just need to keep all of your citizens satisfied by planning your town correctly. The classes have different needs and you need to lay everything out for them before making houses.-Plebians need water, food, and jobs.-Equites need water, food, entertainment, and jobs.-Patricians need water, food, entertainment, religion, olive oil, clothes, and jobs. (olive oil and cloth is taken from your resource store; you dont need the production nearby)Some of these needs require of chain of production, so just plan ahead of time.Do this right and you will have zero fires.

I think that there is also a Mult. community however I never really do it.... However the campaign is interesting and the game is something that you got to give a try...

												Pretty relaxing game and good value when on sale.  I hit 35 hours and probably got about 1/2 way through before getting to the point of it starting to feel more chore like.  So certainly a flawed game, but it starts off so pleasingly casual its worth the $5.Fun early on and against the price it gets a thumbs up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Grand Ages: Rome is one of a very few city building games that satisfies the player's desire to SEE how awesome their work was. This game might have been released some time ago now (2009), but the level of detail is very satisfying. Zooming right down into your city center and watching the hustle and bustle of a Roman city feels -so- good. Very few city builders give you this feeling, with games like SimCity almost reaching the same feeling but falling a little bit short. I also appreciate the accuracy of Roman architecture and culture that this game has. GA:R is designed in such a way that cities the player builds don't look like a player-built city; putting a few hours into a level can make it look like a dev-designed city! As someone who values immersion and depth of detail more than anything in strategy games, GR:A has a special place in my heart for the visual appeal.One thing I gripe about, though; the size of levels/plots are somewhat small. Upon purchasing and booting the game up, I was expecting something pseudo-open world, or even something where cities are connected in some way (I.E SimCity 2014, where city plots are pretty close together and connected via highways, trade, airports etc.), but unfortunately every plot is an individual gamestate. The military side of the game is also very limited - I feel that the advertisement point of ""build massive armies"" is a large overstatement. On some plots/levels, there is no actual point to building military structures and units. I'd love it if there were factions in this game that you partook in actual diplomacy with, but this game doesn't use these systems at all. It's entirely about loading up a city plot and building - a sandbox with objectives, if you will.Pros: -Amazing visual dazzle and grandure-Respects and keeps to the Rome of classical times-Very liberating in terms of customisation and building-Decent military aspect, but limited-Good use of resource management/tradeCons:-Closed off game world-Lack of open-world grandure8/10. Right up there with Anno City-Builders! ",44,4,0,15,13,0,25

												This is a really interesting, well-built, and fun game. It's like Tropico, but in Antiquity. The graphics are beautiful. The gameplay is smooth and engrossing: it has a Civilization feel but it's mixed with Tropico and Cities: Skylines. In fact, it's really along the lines of Cities: Skylines. It's not as in depth or hard to grasp, but it's got the same amount of fun. Really, this is a well-built game and a gem I think anyone can enjoy. Try it out. There is no real combat or war etc. though, so don't go into the game thinking you will be building empires etc. This is a city-building simulation game.			",62,1,0,11,24,1,43

Nice leveling system. Grand graphics-no pun intended. No bugs found.Tips for people new to the game:Make sure hygiene is high-believe just believe me.Make sure there is always a place for firefighters.My personal experience with the game is pretty cool. As I already said no bugs found. Good voice acting for the characters. Nice historical events actually if you want your kid/s to learn history.And if your there just to build and thrive. Hands down its a good game.			",7,3,0,2,3,0,2

I do like the free-style building of towns where the buildings can merge into one another and the roads can be bent to your liking when you place them so you can make a natural-looking place.

												A nice game, honestly! Considering that it has been around for a while, its graphic impact is still great. You are presented with a huge amount of missions to face and the game gets really challenging quite fast. You need patience and time. There are a lot of things to take into account - your citizens are really easy to displease, barbarians are restless and time missions are really punishing.However, as far as city sims go it is a sound product; on a nice sale it is going to be a safe investment!

												Pretty good if you just wanna build an awesome nice-looking city.. except that doing that 10x for every campaign map takes way too much time and effort, much less when the goal is reached and the city you spent so much time on just vanishes afterwards. The army you can field also has a limited cap.. which kinda shucks when you want soldiers to pose at every gate and archway.Price is dirt cheap at this time though. It could have been even better.

												Good city management game similar to games some of you might have played as kids such as Caesar 3. The game comes with 2 campaigns of decent length and multiplayer which is dead but you can still play with a friend. The construction and mantaining of the city is actually very simple in this game. So simple that hardcore fanatics of the genre might actually be turned off. However it is still fun. Combat is also present in the game but it is also pretty shallow. Basically right click and who has the bigger army wins. That being said if you looking for an easier game in the genre this is definitely that.			",643,169,18,57,56,10,122

												It's more of a goods/materials manager than a  city builder.  Each building produces a certain amount of goods or products and some can be upgraded via research. Most buildings will also require maintenance in the form of resources like wood, stone, marble, etc.Buildings have a certain influence radius and if houses are placed outside that radius it doesn't get that building's benefits. Buildings that provide entertainment are really crucial and houses must have access to these more than anything. Providing labor will also mean buildings must be withing the radius of houses.The downside is that Influence Radius will take importance over aesthetics and often you'll start building cities in the most efficient template. Efficieny over aesthetics pretty much sums up the game. Build only what you need and use slave labor (mostly limited to resources buildings) as much as possible to reduce costs.Money making seems easy enough once trade opens up later in the campaign. Even basic temples will provide a good sum of cash. Your character can level up and have skills which benefit your city or military. It's a good game if you're looking for managerial or resource oriented city building game but not so much if you're looking to build grand and aesthetically impressive cities. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Yeah i know hipsters loathe anything they find inferior being praised, but once again we should just do it anyway and enjoy their sweet succulent ""not rage but really is rage they just don't want to come out and admit because they wanna be the cool kids but not be a cool kid because it's mainstream""should be enjoyed and feasted upon, and believe me that quote on quote CAN and SHOULD be longer but hipsters are to be mocked, not mentioned.Now that we got that out of the way, lets continue.  I find grand ages: rome highly underrated, to those who bought it and regret it, give it a chance, it's a game you gotta break the mold with first to properly enjoy before passing judgement (and believe me, i understand not everyone has to like the same game, and it's okay if you just simply dislike grand ages: rome, to each their own after all.)Grand Ages: Rome combines the city building mechanics you would find in games like sim city or civlization with real time strategy mechanics like resource gathering and upkeep, woven together to make a unique blend of strategy games.  Much like age of wonders, you can incite discontent with opposing colonies to make rioting occur and destroy the settlement from the inside out by striking at critical resource points (on multiplayer anyway).Another great strength is also a great weakness for this game, it has a lot of factoids about the good ol empire of old, and although it is non linear it follows a lot of major events during the roman empire's reign and you meet various important figures during that time as one of 5 very important clans back in the empires days.  This is also a dramatically gaping weakness because it sorta boxes in an audience that enjoys roman history, something not everyone is directly interested in all the time.  It isn't intentional, the game is meant to make you, the player, an ancient roman governor of old, so it succeeds in providing this atmosphere, but it's an ""either you like it or hate it"" because of that too.  (even non-roman history enthusiasts can like this game, but it is gonna rely on the mechanics as a selling point.) ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ok. I have complicated feelings about this game. Let me start out by saying that I definitely recommend this one, but have some serious issues with it. Summary:Cities you build will probably be not the most aesthetically pleasing due to the building influence system.Combat is very poor with little depth and is just boring, but tacked on to many missions.Game does the setting rather poorly, giving little depth to the various characters you encounter.On the upside, these are the only serious problems I have with the game. It’s actually a very good city builder, that you don’t get many of these days. With 5 families, replay value is actually very high.Definite recommend.End SummaryFirst of all, the building mechanics and resource management are actually very good, and make building a city and planning for expansion a lot of fun. On the bad side, the influence mechanic (every building that provides some sort of satisfaction, be it religion, entertainment or food, has an area of influence with all residences in that area benefitting from it) makes it very had to build aesthetically pleasing cities. However, cities that look like a tangled mess with practically no space between buildings function just fine, and all your cities end up like it, once you discover that building for aesthetics can seriously handicap you for harder missions. Roads, introduced in Augustus expansion, are land waste and you end up building short stretches of it as dots all over the city to get the bonuses for some buildings.Combat system sucks and the weakest point in the game. Units can gain experience, which does not seem to do anything substantial as for their performance. Enemy units seem to be able to pass right through your front line infantry to attack your archers, and many battles devolve into comical mess. (Side note: why are there Hastati and Triarii in the game? It takes place post Marian reforms, which essentially abolished that system and replaced it with Legions...)It is also unfortunate that many campaign missions are combat oriented. Campaign system is actually very good. You choose a family to play as, and level up as you go from mission to mission. The leveling up system is actually very good. There are 3 perk trees, 2 of which as same for every family and 3rd one being unique to each family. The bonuses you get from family tree may seem rather insignificant at first, but they may greatly change the way you play the game, adding great deal of replay value to it. Setting takes place at the time of the Fall of the Roman republic and you end up being introduced to various historical figures from that era. From Cicero to Caesar. Unfortunately all the characters end up feeling like some puppets (poor quality of voice acting in some instances...Pompey.... does not help). It feels like opportunity was missed here to make campaign very engaging. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played this game for just shy of 15 hours and I felt as though I had played this game to it's fullest potential.  I have plenty of city builders under my belt and this one fell short.  Every mission is nearly identical in the early, mid, and late games.  The only variance between missions is the map.  Now, fundamentaly that is true of any city builder but this game takes it to a new level.  The map gave me far more difficulty than ANY objectives of the mission.  Placing buildings is just a pain.  If the land has even the smallest, slightest, most insignificant incline, forget about building a structure there.  But you may say, royalrush, there are platforms you can use to make the land flat.  Yes you can, but when I have to cover literally 1/2 the map in platforms in order to build anything, then we have a problem.  The camera is just terrible.  The absolute worst camera controls and angles of any non first person shooter I have played.Combat is lack luster.  If this game claimed to be a plain city builder than the combat would be acceptable but for a game that claims combat as the focus, it falls short. ",13,0,0,4,2,0,11

												BACK TO CAESAR IV FOR MEI was always a great fan of 'Caesar IV' and 'Grand Ages Rome' was presented as some sort of next gen successor. I must say that it wasn't for me.Much debate in city-building circles about whether we should be allowed to pause to plan. I prefer this as it allows for a deeper, more complex game. 'Grand Ages Rome's designers didn't. The game mechanics have been streamlined with flow supply that strips out much micromanagement but makes little sense realistically speaking. Desireability has been confuted with popularity, so while the proximity of buildings to each other has some meaning, the resultant cities are typically lacking in strong structure or beauty. I was particularly irked by their handling of the forum, which unlocks most higher city functions but is otherwise pretty much a useless waste of space, adding nothing to governance and typically shunted to the obscure margins of the city rather than being at its heart, as it should be historically speaking.I'm not much interested in the military aspects and am pleased these are largely skippable, but aside from an often anachronistic broader range of units and formations, 'Grand Ages Rome' adds nothing to 'Caesar IV' either.'Grand Ages Rome' does have the merit of slightly deeper governer development--extra skills and resources as well as titles and income compared to 'Caesar IV'--but these come across as overpowerful (e.g. Vox Pop!) and detracting from player's skill to me. The tech tree stuff seemed highly unconvincing in the context of an ancient city builder too.In conclusion, if you want a game with goals like 'complete this scenario in 20 minutes' and find detailed planning or resource management tiresome, 'Grand Ages Rome' might be worth $15, but there are better, older games out there that are actually cheaper.

												Meh, I am a massive fan of Kalypso games especially the Tropico series but this one did not cut it for me. I was really impressed by the low pc requirements required to run this game on highest settings and how nice it actually looks in game. The game runs very smoothly but the mechanics in-game such as the riots and buildings being burnt down is soooooooo annoying. You need to build prefectures to put fires out but in order to get them you need to research them and then build them plus the plebs to work in them plus the food to feed those plebs then they need entertainment as well otherwise they riot and your whole town ends up burning to the ground.This is not a strategy game that you can kinda sit back every so often and just enjoy your accomplishments and the progress of your settlement - the rush is always on you if you sit back and relax for too long riots will begin, also trying to make your armies march in an orderly fashion is impossible and placement is even more confusing.I cannot recommend this game unfortunately as I really had high hopes for this one but I just don't like the gameplay - they should of aimed at making this game a little more like Tropico, brought edicts and things like that into the game. They could of made this game a lot deeper.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Horrid game spent another 4 hours on it, thought Id give it  a little more time since my first review which was negative and some how did not get posted? So here I go again, If you like watching your buildings burn down every 30 seconds and having to rebuild over and over and over again, go for it. otherwise game has no flow or feel what so ever. I really enjoy RTS games such as Stronghold, Total war, and Empire of Ages but this is just a miss all around. Could go on but not even this review is worth the time I wasted on this game.

												I thought it would be better than Imperium Romanum Gold Edition, but I am wrong.the graphic is good, but the others aspects are poor than Imperium Romanum.There are many types of military units you can recruit, but all you need is a few elite units, just train them to a level higher than barbarian, as barbarian cannot level up, then you can defeat in defend and gain further level up. then you can use one squad to win 3 barbarian units.Now you can conquest the village instead of just burn them down, but the resource gain from them are negligible.The UI is very poor, I can see the door direction in Imperium Romanum, but it's gone in Grand Ages: Rome.The building panel is laggy.The when you build a road, the system will help you auto connect two ends, but the fact is that it often can't connect due to angle, the road is too short, slope.I cannot select and see my citizen which can in Imperium Romanum.There are 2 improvement that I admire.1. you can finally ask slaves to work instead of just doing ""logistic""2. You can upgrade food and production building so you don't need to expand your city too large which is easier to maintain a small city than a large oneIf you like this type of game, go buy Imperium Romanum Gold Edition.

												Grand ages Rome is your typical city builder.One major problem with the game is that it's so dumbed down many features you would expect of the genre are just missing or done poorly i.e can't modify landscape,city never evolves,can't manipulate citizens,and restrictive building. The campaign will grow repetitive and stale fast.PROS-the game looks great and your towns will start to truly look like a a town.-You can train soldiers and send them off to war.-you can level up a character but does little to change the overall gameplay.CONS-city never evolves-can't manipulate,or see how see how citiztens feel about the town.-Building feels very restrictive as you are constrained to certain rules.-Free build mode missing options like cant turn on/off disasters, no barbarians, or even a world domination modeRating: 5.5/10			",67,14,0,17,10,0,26

												If you've played Caesar III and the other series, Zeus, and Pharaoh/Cleopatra then you'll likely enjoy Grand Ages Rome. Just like these games, you'll have to build housing, aquaducts, entertainment, and other sorts of buildings to make the people happy. The only difference is that Grand Ages ditched the roads and replaced them with a radius. Instead of trying to fit a whole bunch of public and private structures on one long stretch of road, you'll be allocating all sorts of buildings in strategic areas to maximize their effects. Since Caesar IV cannot be acquire via through PC digitial download/i.e without a CD disk, then Grand Ages is the alternative.			",118,21,0,14,50,3,88

The combat in this game is okish for what it is, as you won't see much of it. I would compared this game with am Anno game 75% is i city managment 20% in economics and 5% combat. But in the end if you want to create the perfet Roman city this game will definatly be up you alley.Good Points-Long campaign-Can be challenging-Good City mangament system-Ok Combat-Decent EconomyBad Points-Become Very RepetitiveFinal Score 7/10 ",171,14,8,14,16,0,23

If you love history and appreciate the advancements and might that was the Roman Republic/Empire, then you will love this game in all it's detail!			",46,6,2,6,14,0,4

												I have played this game for some time now, and it's one of my favourite city sims. The detail in the graphics is just fantastic - zoom in on the houses and they have latin graffiti scrawled all over them, the monuments have what looks like photos of real relief carvings on them, and all the people wander round doing different things. It's also very pretty! I love getting the camera at a low angle and looking over the roofs of my town as the sun sets in the distance. But Grand Ages doesn't just look nice, it's a fun game to play too. It's easy to play but hard to win. There are many different conditions to fulfil to make your people happy and win each scenario. The DLC is well worth buying too, as it adds some useful new buildings and game aspects as well as a new campaign. My only real criticism is that the campaigns are too short - I'd love to see more campaigns or single mission maps. On the other hand, this is a game you can come back to time and time again. I like to make sure I complete all the optional bonus objectives on each map, or make my people as happy as I can get them. All in all, I would definitely recommend this game. If you are looking for a city sim that isn't too taxing, Grand Ages: Rome is the game for you.			",7,6,0,4,10,0,6

Although this game does not capture the same zeitgeist as Caesar IV, it is still a lot of fun to pay for city managment fans. Meeting the needs of the different kinds of residents was challenging and rewarding but not overly so. Combat, however, was never that interesting or engaging for me - but I only did that on the rarest of occasions.			",89,13,1,21,25,0,27

												A nice little ""light"" RTS/Citybuilder in the vein of Caesar or Stronghold.  This one focuses more on macro planning as there are no ""walkers"" and all resources flow into a central pool. Since placement in't quite as crucial (no workflows) you can make some rather lovely, yet functional, cities. Combat is simple yet diverse enough to be interesting. The best aspect is the customization of your faction as you play the campaign. You have some RPG elements playing one of five houses with three skill trees. Two are shared, but each house has a unique tree which really does affect how you play. Each mission gives you one more skill point, and bonus objectives in missions often add to your house wealth or making estates available. Estates, after being unlocked, are bought and provide extra resources. ",155,55,0,58,57,0,71

												I decided to play the game because in the past I enjoyed all the Age of Empires series. Unfortunately this game turned out to be much less enjoyable. During the first hours of playing, it's ok, but as the time goes on buidling the city and maintaining it becomes boring. Also, the military part and battles themselves are not as absorbing as in the series I mentioned earlier. Shame, because the game is set in a period of Civil Wars and the birth of the Empire which were very interesting parts of Ancient Roman history, when a lot of interesting things happened.

This game is unstable, it lags when buildings finish construction, and locks up at random points, I can't get past mission two, and I had actually made it half way through the game the last time. Until some sort of solution is brought up I would either suggest Ceaser 4, or even Tropico 4 if you want a game that works like this one and is much more stable.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is very interesting. When I bought it, I thought it was a CivCity Rome like game. Nope. You are building a city, yes. A Roman city. But the gameplay is totally different. Hard to discribe as I haven't played much, but Just so you know, it is not a CivCity Rome knockoff.			",28,2,1,2,7,0,6

												You can't play the game if you have two monitors running.  You have to disconnect one or game will crash.There is no ""windowed"" mode. Game also asks u for CD key when starting, even though u bought it on steam -- very annoying time waster.Don't buy this one, check out the other Rome city builders.  I am. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Okay, first of all I played so far: all sort of Cossacks, Total War series, Age of Empires series, Rise of Nations, The Settlers 2-6, Stronghold Crusader, Red alert 1,2, Command and Conquer 3, Warcraft II-III, some Age of mythology, Starcraft I-II, Empire Earth series, Imperium Galactica II and more, and I LOVE ancient Rome's history related things... And then there is this game which hyped me up pretty much by pics/trailer and I feel so disappointed... but for a closer look my opinion:About Campaign and Tutorial so far:Pros:+Nice graphics+Easily controlable units+Simple way to look up resourcesCons:-Way TOO small radius for buildings-(For me) The game feels like it's about 95% economy 4% luck (how is the ground around you), 1% military which is tragic-Boring sounds and music (especially annoying when you randomly hear fighting sounds at your plebs' places, you check it out and there isn't any fight ongoing-Problematic lands - you supposed to be able to make similar ground with a cheap ""layment"" which you can build on, but it's not working everywhere, not even close to everywhere, it barely has meaning to use-Signs and autmatic mechanisms - if you cannot be always 100% sure how many buildings and plebs you have, it's super easy to lose track what should you Stop and let Run, since some will work automatically if you have enough ppl, others won't-Lack of unit skills, commands, formations-Lack of tutorial for 85% of the buildings which are availableRecommended For: people who wants to care for infinite babies ~ as soon as you manage to have food they need entertainment, as you manage it, there is not enough population to military, since you expand more plebs they need more water circle and other buildings to relay on, you need food provider buildings (for plebs) but they working with more plebs too. Feels like an infinite circle where you can barely get to the point. I mean If I want in AOE2 for example I put down a barrack at about the beginning and can start fighting... I understand the concept, but definitely unplayable for me.			",35,12,0,1,2,0,7

												If you can stop your citizens from burning down your town in the first 5 minutes of gameplay you're doing well, if you dont have water or food your citizens will burn the entire place down this is the same for entertainment and temples, Only thing i can suggest is to play through the tutorial mission's and it will sort of half show you how to play the game.The Resource system is very different than other RTS games, its more about income to usage rather than stockpiling goods.Multiplayer is only possible if you have friends to play with there is no AI in multiplayer maps so coop campaign or coop multiplayer is impossible unless you have 4 friends online, this games community is beyond dead (560 players - none active), also requires a login to play any multiplayer game, does not support lan without logging into their servers.I do enjoy playing it but the talent system just destroy's multiplayer due to allowing your first units created to be rank 10 after playing through the campaign instead of rank 1 this is persistant through single player and multiplayer.Coop shared base is impossible without voice communication and its stupidly easy to stagnate your town, getting to the point the only way to win is to not play at all, your citizens go absolutely insane and BURN EVERYTHING to the ground.

												I give this game a 2/5... Mainly because of the camera movement and building placement controls... Also it is very limited in details, the number of commodities and strategies..... This is basically a knock-off of a very old game called Caesar III by Sierra Games... Caesar III was so popular, it spun off other titles such as Caesar IV , Zeus , Pharaoh , and Poseidon.... If you want to play a city building game based on Roman times, I suggest you get Caesar III instead of this game... The gameplay is full of detail, logical, and the controls in the game are strait forward and easy to use.... It's going for $10 on Amizon.com ... 9-14-2014			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												BUILD,BUILD,DESTROY!!!!!Interesting game i must say, good campain, good Leveling system. Challenging gameplay! Yet you can build your own cityand challenge nearby Barbaric villages. Gain resorces, gain money, and gain power. Custom cities. you can build foreverDAYS AND DAYS OF ROMAN BUILDINGS AND POOLS. Godmode is an option also. I myslef do not use it because i like challenges. I only got the DLC for Multiplayer. BUYING MULTIPLAYER!!!!!! STUPID PEOPLE DONT BUY MULIPLAYER!!!!They like enjoying  games not wasting money on it YOU MORONS! - not the people who play this game. you guys are nice and very smart most likely, i was speaking to the developers for being sellouts on there own game. They could have added THE AUGUSTUS DLC without the multiplayer. They should have put the multiplayer in the game itself not with a dlc who had that idea! a guy who wanted prophit. to be mean. goofy. nein, he did to add it to the game because they ment for the game to a solo game but it was to late, therefor they added it to the game because it was a popular game until medieval. so they added a DLC to add the muliplayer. for our enjoyment.They are nice guy i promise. *Cross my fingers*: So it is all in all a good game i love the developers for making it as it is a good experience. if you play with friends and family. solo is not that fun but, it will do so for now i will play but there is no-one to play it with sadly.GOOD GAME IF YOU HAVE NOTHING TO DO IT WAS A CHEAP MOVE PUTTING THE MULTIPLAYER IN THE DLC THOUGH!

												A simple but interesting Roman city builder game, but lacks depth. Though the main campaign is boring, skirmish mode is where this game truly shines. However, the major downfall for me is not having many battles if any. I don't recommend this and I wished I didn't pay $25 for it.			",86,10,0,23,12,1,42

												5/10Grand ages is actually a well polished game with a solid tutorial, but i went into this game hoping, it's was an age of empire kind of RTS game, which may explain my dislike of this game, i fell constrained while playing, specific buildings needs to be within regions of each other to work, farms much use predefined areas to grow fields, the game uses a kind of real-time economy system, meaning you can't store resources for a specific job etc. in all fairness the mechanics works well, but i often found myself, having to micromanage building-placement rather than concerning about the greater scheme of things, for me.  Graphics and sound is top notch, lush colors and great 3D assets, you feel like taking a stroll in your city, the navigation is kind of okay, but a bit slow at times.if your hoping for an replacement to Age of empires, this is properly not for you.

I am uninstalling it now because of the constant crashes as they make it just not worth playing.  Game had potential to be fun but there are better options to spend your time on than this.

On the other hand, all the citizens/slaves are really just eye candy and most don't perform their relative tasks. But, it's a solid city-builder with a nice window into Ancient Roman life on the frontier.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
