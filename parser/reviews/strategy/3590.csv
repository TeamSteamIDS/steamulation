												Plant vs. Zombies is a cute,addictive and fun game for all ages. I play it a lot of my old school laptop, and it runs completely fine even on that. The game has a lengthy story with various challenges to overcome. There's many plants, zombies and maps to play around with. The story is very simple, but fun. Crazy Dave is quite hillarious.Plant vs. Zombies is a defense game. Your task is to defend the garden against waves of enemies and upgrade the garden. It starts of easy, but new zombies and plants are added throughout the story. You will earn coins and other rewards which you use to buy new items from the store and upgrade your Zen Garden. The game is really simple when it comes to graphics, but it's adorable. All the plants and zombies have unique abillites and funny looks. The game is really small, but there's so much content here. Challenge mode, survival, story, Zen Garden, water park, mini-games,tree-challenge and a store full of important and fun upgrades. The fun simply never ends. This is a must own!

												Plants vs. Zombies GOTY Edition is a strategy tower defense game from PopCap, which is now part of Electronic Arts.Plants vs. Zombies GOTY Edition is a very good and fun game, with great gameplay. Defend your home from invading zombies who wants to eat your brains, with many plants such as peashooter, chomper, cherry bomb or wall-nut. There are many plant types to choose from, each with their unique abilities and purposes. Of course the zombies are also vary, like the trash can zombie, buckethead zombie, conehead zombie, pole vaulting zombie or even dancing zombie that can summon backup dancer zombies. There are also many mini games that can entertain for hours with their even more unique and vary gameplay. There is also even a survival game to which you defend until you can't defend no more.Plants vs. Zombies GOTY Edition has cute and great design on plants and zombies. You can also create your own Zombatar with this game. You will also meet a crazy guy who will sold you even more plants or tools for you to use, or sometimes have you do something crazy.One of the downside and the only downside of this game is that it doesn't support greater resolution size beyond 800x600. So even on fullscreen, you stuck on 800x600 and there will be a black screen on left and right side of the screen.Plants vs. Zombies GOTY Edition is a great tower defense game, with many mini game and great gameplay, this game can make sit down in front of you computer for hours. I recommend this.Rating 9/10			",1157,346,58,143,166,12,228

Talk about a gem, am I right?Plants vs. Zombies is the game I showcase to friends who are non-gamers, because it is digital crack. PopCap took tower defense theory and boiled it down to its most pure elements, and coated that with beautiful artwork, themes, and great sound. I've purchased this game three times on PC, and once on mobile. Money very well spent.I don't care if you normally play Call of Duty or Undertale or anything in-between, here is what you need to know:1. If you haven't played this, buy it immediately and I guarantee you will not regret it. It will suck you in instantly.2. All you need is a mouse.The only downside is that there are black bars on my screen, but hey, that's older games for you.Absolutely worth full price for literally anyone who even has a minor interest in gaming.

												Tower defense games have come a long way in these past years and only with Plants vs. Zombies has this type of game reached its zenith. While past incarnations have been somewhat inaccessible to casual gamers, PopCap Games has done what they do best and brought tower defense to the masses. Not only that but did I mention that it has plants AND zombies? The end result is a quirky and addictive game that will have you bringing down hoards of zombies late into the night. Don't say I didn't warn you, because once you start playing the first few levels.....well, you get the idea.			",55,2,0,7,0,2,6

												Plants vs Zombies, GOTY Edition is a must-have game if you like the Tower Defense genre. Basically, the idea is very simple: defend your garden(s) against the relentless attacks of Zombies, trying to get into your house. The means you have at your disposal to do so, are ... plants. Plants in all varieties: from the basic grunt (aka the Pea Shooter) through the basic defense plants such as potatoes (halting zombies for awhile) up to plants that are capable of doing great amounts of damage, even inclusing kamikaze-like jumbing plants. Which is needed too: the Zombies come in different varieties and are more resilient than you'd expect from your average Zombie. But they are pretty brainless as well and just rugh at you, in ever growing numbers. There is a bit of strategy involved, however, first of all by choosing the 8 possible plants for a given level, and secondly by the actual planting. Since you have zes different lanes through which the Zombies come Marching In, it's important to keep everything well-covered.You have one resource at your disposal: sunlight, which comes naturally (except in the night-levels) or, mostly, by means of planting sunflowers. The more sunlight you collect, there more plants can grow at the same time. No water needed. Simple, isn't it? Furthermore, the Zombies drop coin (they seem to go on a stroll with some plan...) which you can use to buy new slots for your plants, or some upgrades with a crazy neighbour.And that's it,  really. There is an extensive adventure mode, slowly revealing all the plants (over 40!!) and zombie-types, and there are great mini-games that give you an extended challenge. It's all so well done with vivid graphics, and so humourish that it's difficult to resist. It comes with a bunch a Steam achievements which I recommend heartily, since they let you discover some possibilities of the game you otherwise wouldn't have thought about.There are some techical shortcomings which did bother me. The Steam-version is basically a port from the mobile platform versions, and to be honest, it's very badly done. There is only one fixed resolution (800x600 I think), no widescreen support, so the game uses only the middle portion of the screen if you happen to have a widescreen (which I guess most of us have by now). This is really appaling, and should long have been fixed by now. Some graphics configuration options might come in handy as well.Gameplay: 24/30Graphics: 14/20Sound: 7/10Longelivety: 7/10Technical & stability: 12/20Personal appreciation: 8/10Overall: 72/100			",290,156,5,32,35,4,67

												[WARNING: Excessive play may cause: Headaches, Extreme anger, Tiredness, Brain cravings, Singing Sunflower hallucinations, Feeling the need to wear a hard hat around vegetables, Damage to already lacking braincells (which in the long run is good for you, because Zombies are less likely to start showing up at the bottom of your garden,) Extreme Seed Hoarding, Lawnmower collecting, Going outside to converse with your neighbours (certain death) and flatulence.]Armed with your cucumber, armed with your radish, boldly you will step on to the dew laden grass within the safe perimeter of the picket-fenced home that you always dreamed of. Plant your vegetables you shall, before running with haste back to safety, back to the comforting confines of your kitchen, to peek through those awful curtains your mother gave you.And when the war drums sound, and the stink of the rotting folks that you used to lay flowers for appear at bottom of the lane, as they march with squelching feet and missing limbs, and they cry for the soft tenderness of your grey matter, you will stand tall and scream. For mercy.The first over the hurdle will fall, much to your delight as the power of Vitamin D, E, B2 and K, blights the haunted flesh; as you realise that they and they only provide the sustenance of life, and that you know, deep down - your mother, she was right.And should your walnut fall, should your pumpkin be defaced, you know that somewhere down the line of peas you will have reveg. Yes reveg you shall, against those zombies swimming through the tears of fallen onions, against those who moonwalk across your crops, dusting them with glitter, against those who dare destroy your expensive garden equipment. And when all is lost and your arsenal depleted, you can only pray that you grew a really tasty squash.- An excellent, casual Tower Defence with an overall cute charm, one of my favourites, and easily enjoyable for all.- Huge replay value with 18 puzzles, 20 mini-games, achievements, zombie creation and a Zen garden alongside the main adventure.- Fantastic soundtracks, featuring music from Laura Shigihara (To the Moon, 'Everything's Alright'), including the 'There's a Zombie on your Lawn' soundtrack.- I'm fairly sure my college grade suffered due to this. As always kids, never buy anything out the boot of crazy strangers cars, especially plants that grow and produce bags of money for you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the great games of all time and a testimony to Popcap at their best, before their acquisition by EA. This game is many things to many people: casual time-waster, fount of slightly twisted humor, excellent strategy game. If you have never played it, it is worth much more than it costs here on Steam. I've been playing it since it first launched, and I am sure I'll be playing it ten years from now.A joy and a pleasure.			",34,36,0,31,16,0,10

												Tell me - do you like zombie shooters? You do? Well - now your child or grandma can enjoy them with you!Oh, you don't, just like me? But you do like tower defence as I do, don't you? In this case - how about trying that little game? Sweet, funny, colorfull, visually and audially appealling. Easy enough for everyone to master, but not too easy to get boring.One warning though - it is highly addictive! Or is it another plus?			",2655,1114,70,256,330,24,364

												Never you mind my Steam hours...I've got a good twenty or thirty hours up on the mobile phone version of this; a phrase which, in all honesty, you won't hear me utter too often (mostly 'cause it's the ONLY game I've played on a mobile for longer than, say, a handful of minutes).   So having perused the Menu and seen all the mini-games and modes available, and played nearly half-way through the ""Adventure"" mode, what differences have I noticed between this and the mobile version? Well, I gotta say...not many. I don't recall the option to ""customise"" the look of your zombies on the mobile version, but that kinda petty, purely cosmetic♥♥♥♥♥♥is all by the by; the simple fact remains that, no matter what the format, this is far and wide one of the simplest, yet cleverest, and moreover most MADDENINGLY ADDICTIVE real-time strategy/tower defense games you will ever play.    Is it worth another purchase, if you already have it on mobile? Hmmm, probably not, unless it's on sale, or if you generally prefer (as do I) to use a mouse rather than rubbing your grotty little fingers all over your telephone screen. Oh, and I guess there's the Achievements, if you're inclined towards such things (me, only up to a point).   If you don't already have it, buy it. If you already have it, buy it when it's a buck or so. It's a bit of a no-BRAINer, really (hahaha, I made a funny, look Mummy, I made a post-post-modernist zombie funny, ooh I'm so clever, look Mummy, me so clever, me so clever)...   Verdict: 9.5/10 (docking half a point ONLY because the pint-sized graphics look just the tiniest bit ""wrong"" on a larger computer monitor. But ONLY for that reason).			",745,418,6,57,40,5,78

												If you like zombies, get this game because you can find different types of zombies there.If you do not like zombies, get this game because you get to kill so many of em and name yourself zombie killer after you beat this game.If you are a zombie, you must get this game because you get to kill your comrades and be the zombie master.If you arent a zombie, then what are you waiting for? Get this game or wait for zombies to destroy your lawn.This game is crazily fun; has a funny-talking npc and a awesome ending song.This game is not one of the ""killing zombies"" and thats it game. It has more contents than you think it has.You get to grow your plants, collect coins from em and buy the items that are useful to go against the zombies.Moreover, it has puzzle levels which require high intelligence in order to get all of em completed. 10/10 will play through it again in the futureNote: This game is great to be played on iPads.

												Plants vs Zombies is an old game that still holds it's own. The setting is your house where you are in charge of planting mutant plants to defend your home from zombies. You meet only one other character called Crazy Dave, 'cause his shop is, ""Crazy!"" This tower defense game will challenge your mind as you progress to more difficult levels. What Pop Cap Games had created is a game that is one of the most addictive of it's kind. You won't grow tired with Plants vs Zombies as there is a variety of plants (towers) to use. Each plant can be used tactically, like using a Hypno-Shroom against a zombie. Just as the plants name implies it hypnotizes the zombie to fight for your side, obviously recommended for tougher enemies . There are plenty of other plants of it's ilk in this game to meet your strategic need. Plants vs Zombies has plenty of other challenges like, mini-games, puzzles and survival modes. The mini-games range from plant zombies that shoot back at you, to playing whack-a-zombie. The puzzle mode gives you a chance to play in different modes as the zombies or a breaking a pot game. (Where is Link when you need him?) Survival mode is similar to adventure mode; it just has more challenging levels. Then, there is a Zen Garden you can unlock as you progress through adventure mode. The goal there is to make a money farm for your grinding and to help grow a talking tree. So, yes plenty of other things to do long after you have finished adventure mode. What kind a game has so much replay value? My wife and son still enjoy playing it, years after it's release. It is a shame we won't likely be seeing a true sequel for the PC, but at least it's on your mobile phone. (Thanks EA...) Plants vs Zombies has plenty of fun for everyone of all ages. This game can stand tall for being one of the best games of it's genre and for the price. Why not pick one up for yourself?			",72,13,2,55,22,0,14

												PopCap at their finest hour. A fantastic mix of casual strategy and tower defence with a great focus on mechanics. It's a true shame what the franchise has evolved into nowadays but the original PvZ still lives on  as a fantastic game that I constantly recommend to anyone who loves strategy games. Some of the challenge modes will keep you coming back again and again and can be a heap of fun to play with friends gathered around the screen. Indeed, some of the best PvZ moments I've had are helping others get into the game for the first time.A must play game in my opinion.			",169,29,1,34,14,0,41

												Plants vs Zombies is first of its kind. There were many copies made ever since. It's a great game of simple tower-defense-based idea. The goal of the game is to protect your house from incoming waves of zombies. How do you do it? By planting your green friends in the garden. They shoot, they explode, they produce sun, that is your currency, you can place huge nuts as walls, that zombies need to breach before getting through.It's a really nice, warm, colorful and enjoyable game for everyone.Seriously, even my parents like to play it from time to time to bust some zombie asses.

												You want tower defense? You want zombie killing? You want a little sunshine in your life?There's no reload. There are no elitist classes. These plants dgaf. They will spit, chew, stomp, and nuke your wannabe-Michael-Jackson-zombie dance party. This PopCap game is amazing. It's super fun, addictive, and an absolute favorite. There are different modes, puzzles and mini-games - plus it worked on my crummy HP laptop.  It's a casual game - yeah it looks a little silly, but everyone who has played it loves it. It also helped me procrastinate during my graduate courses - good times. 10/10 will procrastinate again.			",145,28,4,17,2,0,8

												A really fun light hearted tower defense game with a healthy campaign and a lot of extra modes and mini games. The object of the game is to defend your home against zombies with plants. Sun jewels fall from the sky and you click on them. This gives you currency to buy plants to set them up in the path of zombies. If a zombie makes it to your house, then it eats your brain. The zombie enemies are diverse and quirky. Your plans that you defend your house with are equally fun and quirky.  The campaign is split into 5+ major chunks (front yard, pool, night yard, night pool, roof and so on). Each one of these major chunks has a few levels in it. Each level consists of 3+ waves of zombies marked on the bottom of the map. So its like an endurance sort of thing until the final wave.There is plenty of reason to come back and keep playing. Especially since you pick your own plants. The mini games offer a lot of diversity. Things like bowling for zombies, whack a zombie, be-zombied, and even a mode where you need to make it through as zombies to eat brains. There is a ton of fun here for a week and then in a year another week of fun and in another year another week of fun. This isn't the type of game you play forever, but it is a lot of fun while it lasts.			",1127,324,52,104,96,15,167

												Plants VS Zombies is a simple and classic tower defense game, whereby you deploy a variety of different plants to protect your lawn from zombies to stop them from eating your brain. Fending off wave after wave of different types of zombies provides an entertaining and relaxing way to pass the time. With plenty of minigames to play as well as endless modes after you finish the campaign will keep you occupied for plenty of time. You can also develop your Zen garden as you collect more plants as you play!Pros:+ Many hours of fun and provides a relaxing way to kill some time+ A nice selection of plants allows you to try different combinations to play your own way+ A wide variety of zombies with different strengths and weaknesses keeps you on your toes+ Large selection of minigames+ Endless modes+ Zen garden with collectable plants+ Can leave your snail in charge of your Zen garden while AFK or in the background+ Some achievements for completionists like myselfCons:- No level select after you complete the campaign- Gameplay can feel repetitive after a while- Tree of Life achievement can be a bit of a grind- Resolution not great in fullscreen modeMy Score: 7/10			",423,136,3,45,19,1,47

												I recently installed this game on my Windows 8 Tablet, since I used to play it on my cousin's Xbox. At first i thought, ""Well, this game is probably not gonna work very well on my tablet."" But so far, i haven't had a single issue or seen a single bug! It even works pretty fast!     I got this game in the Summer Sale for a ridiculously low price of $1.24. The normal price is $4.99, but even that price is cheap for this games worth! The game works quite fast, and it has hardly any bugs. I highly reccomend this game if you like Strategy/Zombies/Tower Defense  games! And no worries parents, the zombies in this game are entirely cartoony, with no innapropriate scenes at all! Possibly the only part that could be considered innapropriate is if you lose, a zombie walks into your house, and eats your brains. It doesn't actually SHOW the zombie eating your brains, just a message pops up saying, ""A Zombie Ate Your Brains!"" It's up to you if you think thats innapropriate, but honestly, I don't think it's something to get worked up over.     Now to talk about what this game is really about! You start out in a normal house, when suddenly zombies try to invade your home! You have to grow special plants to defend your house, such as thhe Peashooter and the Potato Mine.     This game comes with 5 chapters that each contain 9 levels. A normal PvsZ level takes aproximately 5 Minutes, I'm not sure exactly. To add on to that, they even have awesome minigames to put your PvsZ skills to the test!     This is one of the best time-consuming games i have ever played. I highly reccomend you purchase it, as in my opinion is the best tower defense game I have ever seen.			",7,2,2,1,0,0,1

 really good tower defence game with a long tutorial damn this game is good. I'm actually not that big of a fan of tower defence games but this games sucked me in an spat me out some hundred hours later and i still love it.Most people should know the game bye now but if you don't here is a short explanation what's it all aboutThe zombieapokalypse went down but you have some mutated plants that will protect you. So you plant your yawn full of mutated plants which shoot the zombies and by that defend your home form them.The first levels function as a tutorial, where you protect your front yawn but later the zombies try to eat you bye getting in your back yawn or on your roof.And with every level the zombies become more and more and you have to choose which plants to take into the level and where to plant them for max damage and stuff.

												This is one of my favorite video games ever. While there are things to complain about (I'm looking at you graphics), there is almost nothing but mlg in this game.There are 49 plants in total (50 if you count the Tree of Wisdom) and about 25 zombies. There are 5 'areas', each with 10 levels, plus all the mini-games and puzzles. The goal of the game is clear: DONT LET THE ZOMBIES EAT UR BRAINS. Because I don't want to make a huge review, I'm just gonna list the pros for this game:1. Adventure mode is fun, even though it's repititive, and a lot of the times it can be challenging.2.There is a lot to do post game.3. NO IN-APP PURCHASES (YOU HERE THAT, PVZ2?)4. That credit song tho5. The mini games are fun, addictive, and some are HARD.6. The puzzles have the same pros as the mini games.7. You can easily grind for money, either by just playing somemore adventure mode or via oversight/glitch.8. Nothing is too expensive in the shop; everything is priced fairly (excluding Tree of Wisdom food)9. Getting achievments is VERY rewarding.10. It's single-handedly the best tower defense game I've ever played.11. The plants (and zombies) all have special abilities, helping or hindering you. This makes the game interesting to explore.12. For all you hackers out there, this is easy to mod.GO OUT AND BUY THIS GAME! IT'S WORTH THE PRICE!			",12,5,0,2,2,0,1

This game has all the excitement of Tower Defense type gameplay and the silliness of something as strange as Plants and flowers fighting against the Undead. I remember when it first came out, I wanted it so bad. I literally had been waiting for around 5 years for the price to drop from $19.99 to $4.99 like it has on Steam now.

												This game really redefined the use of the term 'tower defense game.' I first tried this game at the Apple store with my girlfriend and we ended up spending hours just sitting there playing it on their free demos. Immediately I went home and purchased the game for both of us right when I got home. I would say I probably beat the game in a week but I never really had the motivation to beat it a second time.Now I've come to Steam and here it is again for 1/4 the price of what I originally paid for it. Picked this up for my girlfriend who has never played it before. She ended up making it my top played game on Steam until I bought her Garden Warfare. For me, there wasn't too much in terms of replay-ability but she seems to get endless hours or joy from this game. I wish they would release the second one for Steam but until then I would literally suggest this game to anyone. Casual gamers and hardcore gamers would both love this game and anyone of any age.PvZ would have to get a 4/5 out of me.			",914,392,15,94,73,11,147

												I really really like this game. I had it on my phone about a year ago as the app and that was fun on that version but I like it better on PC and you also get a bigger screen.This game is very easy to just sit there and lose all the time in the world.It's also awesome how not all of the zombies are the same and some are harder than others.Very awesome, much recommended.

												This game is truly amazing, those who say its bad, They truly didnt live in the mario/old ages, Those people, SUCK FOREVER. Listen, if you were holding plants vs zombies and call of duty i would pick plants vs zombies. Its simply addicting but it gets boring after a while when you completed endless survival. i recommend this game.			",20,5,1,2,11,0,2

												I didn't intend to cover this game originally, but then I figured it was certainly a big enough name to justify, and also a good enough game to talk about. Before Plants VS Zombies was following in the footsteps of Team Fortress 2 and interrupting an indie developer with mood-destroying music at every E3, it started here, as a simple tower defense. This is a kind that's a bit less common on Steam, where you're defending rows rather than winding path. As the title implies, you do this using militaristic plants to combat a bunch of eccentric zombies.Compared to a lot of the games I've talked about, Plants VS Zombies is a pretty casual one. Experience in many of the above titles would make the campaign fairly easy to get through, and even when I played it years ago without any TD experience I don't remember having much trouble. Of course, not every game needs to be hard, far from it, and there's something relaxing about watching your garden take on all comers. Both your plants and the zombies are also both appealing enough to look at without trying too hard, and there's a good amount of enemy variety.You start with a simple Peashooter for damage and a Sunflower for harvesting resources (you do need to manually click on them like Beware Earth, but that's the only thing like it in the game and it's not generally very hectic), and across the course of the campaign get access to forty-seven others that all have some different use, depending on what zombies you're up against or the level. The game mixes things up often enough to keep things from getting too repetitive, and aside from the normal sunny day you'll also have to defend at night, where you get less resources, or at the backyard pool, where you have to build terrain for most of your plants to stand on. You'll also get levels within those that operate on different rules, such as using the Wallnut to bowl down zombies or having to pick your defenses from a sort of conveyor belt.Aside from the campaign there are a bunch of minigames and alternate modes you can unlock, including survival and a role reversal where you pick zombies to go after the plants' defenses. Quite a lot considering the game's only five dollars, the cheapest of any game mentioned so far. If you're looking for a more low-key entry into tower defenses, it would be a good one to pick up, as long as you remember most other ones aren't exactly like this. Even if you're not new to them though, if you somehow haven't played this I can't think of any reason to dissuade you.			",507,225,0,69,23,1,46

												As playing this game for more than a hour, I can safely write this review.I played this game back in 2009 and I had a blast. The last time I played this game was about 2 years ago. I'm back playing it, though. If you want a awesome Plants vs Zombies game that isn't infested with EA then buy this. Or in general, if you want a awesome tower defense, go with this.There is only one downside. This game works perfectly with Windows 7 and lower. I have Windows 8.1... So what does that mean?It means that if you play with 3D acceleration and Fullscreen there would be constant frame drops (this isn't my computer, there are people on the steam discussion page that have the same problem.) and weird blocky pixelated shapes around the zombies, the plants, everything... and the game would look really pixelated. But if you play in windowed mode and turn off 3D acceleration then everything is fine. I'm able to play the game in a good 120 FPS.Overall, It's a really good tower defense. I would recommend it to anyone, not just gamers, but everyone. I had a blast back in 2009 when I played this game, and now I can play it again.			",55,7,0,5,3,0,3

												I love the game!! It's very entertaining, keeps you on your toes and makes you think.The only thing I don't like about it is that after you complete the 5 levels (I think, can't recall when it happens) and go back to the first level to start again (still keeping all plants and progress), Crazy Dave starts picking 3 plants for you. I understand that it adds as a challenge, however, it would have been better if it could be an option or box that you can untick if you want to choose your own.That said, I still play it, it's very awesome, and highly recommended :)			",10,0,0,2,2,0,1

												PvZ is one of the heaviest RTS games to hit this generation. The combination of a deep and intricate mechanics system impleneneted with a gritty, dark graphics style allows for some of the biggest plays seen in the RTS scene. The amount of APM required to even break in at the entry level for this game is nothing compared to that of Starcraft Brood Wars.""One of the most challenging games i faced in my career: - Jae Dong, Professional Starcraft player.""My zerg APM is nothing for this"" - Insec, Professional Zerg player.To conclude this short review, PvZ is for the most intense RTS players out there, only mastered by a select handfull.

												This is good fun to pass away an hour or two at a time as it is quite repetetive. But despite the slight problems, I would still recommend it. I tried the demo first and had an 'Invalid command line parameters -changedir' issue, which I managed to overcome. Despite the problem, I bought the game. When I tried to run the game it had a completely different issue... 'Fatal error - Access Violation (code 0xc0000005)...'  Not a good start. I searched for ages, through loads of forums of people with similar problems and it all seems to come down to display. After trying almost everything I could find, this is what worked for me. The game doesn't seem to like loading full screen, so you can fix this in regedit.HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SteamPopCap\PlantsVsZombies\And set ScreenMode to 0The game loaded for me this way. Once in the game Alt+Return puts you in full screen again. I hope this helps someone/everyone.			",27,3,0,2,3,0,2

												Good, simple tower defence game, easy to get into and play.  Adventure mode is a good length, 5 areas of 10 levels each, with NewGame+ available.  Large variety of plants, and multiple valid strategies to beat levels. Mini-Games Galore: It has several large mini-games and a bunch of smaller single levels with different rules, so plenty of variety and extra things to do away from the main game. One of my favourite games, really enjoyable, easy going gameplay, pleasing art-style/plant designs and plenty of things to do, loved playing Vasebreaker.Only technical issue I ever had with the game was having my save wiped when it transitioned over to cloud saves, other than that it’s all been good.

												As a non casual gamer I wouldn't have stuck with pvz if it was anything but the simplist and most joy us game on the planet. A vortex that Sucks you in with simple and rewarding gameplay feeding you new mechanics and challenges at just the right pace until your a master. Fun graphics. A great and unique concept. Addictive gameplay and reward cycle. Perfect difficulty curve. And a great host of minigames for when it's all over. Or in between games. Pvz is a game changer somthing so fresh is rare seing as hours can tumble to making your perfect defence. I'm a turtle you see. In every rts I ever played I love building up my base defences more than anything else. That's why I'm no good at them. But you see this why this is the game for me. It's no regular tower defence game which I find boring and slow. It has infinite complexity in learning what all your units do and how best to use them. The zombies are cute but ruthless and come in waves and that's when you regret that missplaced sunflower at the start of your game where you now desperately need a walnut.  All this will make sense when you play it... Which you must  ",299,81,8,35,22,2,43

												Great game, when it worked. Now it's plagued with problems (read the discussion boards), and there's effectively no official support for it. I've just gotten through a 1 week war of trying to get actual support to get the game working (with no success). I started at PopCap, as Steam has it listed as official support. PopCap, no matter what you categorize the ticket under will send you an automated message, redirecting you to Pogo. Pogo will tell you that you need to bring it up with Steam (which has no contact method listed). This effectively means you're stuck with a product that does not work and that neither of the two companies which -should- be responsible and have support for it, don't, despite still actively selling it.In summary: Great game, buy it when PopCap and Steam manage to get their crap together and fix this one.

												I played through the app years ago. Then it became free and I played through it again. Then I bought it on Steam and played through it a third time.This game is a fantastic tower defense game because it works in a more structured environment with up to 6 lanes of straight pathways, as opposed to a twisting, curvy path for hundreds of enemies to go through as in most TD games. The plants are adorable and the balance between them and the zombies keeps the game a good difficulty throughout.GabeN's favorite game as of the beginning of 2017.Easy 100% (Time Consuming)10/10 Zombies On Your Lawn			",587,270,20,56,67,4,65

												Simply the best casual game ever made. If you haven't played it, then you have missed out on true greatness. This does NOT include the sequels that were created after EA purchased Popcap Games.			",315,146,6,71,46,4,87

												I played through the app years ago. Then it became free and I played through it again. Then I bought it on Steam and played through it a third time.This game is a fantastic tower defense game because it works in a more structured environment with up to 6 lanes of straight pathways, as opposed to a twisting, curvy path for hundreds of enemies to go through as in most TD games. The plants are adorable and the balance between them and the zombies keeps the game a good difficulty throughout.GabeN's favorite game as of the beginning of 2017.Easy 100% (Time Consuming)10/10 Zombies On Your Lawn			",587,270,20,56,67,4,65

												This is one of my favorite games of all time. I just got the Golden Sunflower trophy today and all I have left to do is to get the remaining acheivements. The Game Of The Year edition adds so much more content that I had not originally played. Even though I had beat the game about 5 times before, I still wanted to buy this so I could beat all the mini-games, puzzles, and survival modes. If anyone is wondering why they should buy this, I have two reasons. First, the price on Steam is incredible considering the release price of the game and that this is the GOTY edition. Second, Plants vs. Zombies is one of my favorite games of all time because it is easy to play and has soooo much content in the game, in fact, you can complete the adventure mode twice! and still get new content.Also, I love the Zen Garden, mine is completely filled and I check on it every other day or so because it is one simple aspect of the game that is just fun to maintain and doesn't take much time at all to do.I would give this game 10/10 for all the reasons listed above!

												Plants vs Zombies (PvZ) is a very fun and addictive Indie game that had me playing for countless hours. It involves simple ""tower-based"" strategy in defending your house against zombies by using various plants as a line of defense. It includes a number of unlockables and mini-games that are made for quick 'n easy entertainment - ideal for laptops. It it also best ran in windowed mode as the game's resolution is fixed.

												Plants vs Zombies is a tower defense game that anyone can sink their teeth into. The campaign mode is just about the easiest thing ever, but the difficulty gets quite up there once you start sampling what infinite survival mode has to offer. There's a surprising amount of strategic depth packed into the simplistic interface, and the colorful atmosphere and delightful soundtrack prevents the game from getting old quickly.

												I LOVE The plants vs. zombies game! I've played previously on the Ipod, Xbox 360, and Nintendo DS systems, but using the computer was a new experience. If you haven't played this game before, trust me, it's worth the five bucks. This is a strategic tower defence, where you use plants to repell a zombie attack. Defend your house and your brains using the Peashooter, Cabbagepult, and many more, in locations like your front yard, night in your front yard, your pool in the day, your pool in the night, and your roof! Pros: Good graphics, not too good or bad to distract you. The game is pretty much simple, so everybody can easily play. There's more than defense too! Minigames, A plant garden, a shop, and a giant tree you grow! There's no cons I've discovered, as the gameplay and content I've completed on all four platforms is bug-free. Parents, your kids will love this game! Kids, your parents might like this game! Thanks for reading my review,DignifiedPeach			",201,16,2,28,17,0,13

												An extremely addictive, yet incredibly fun tower-defense game. I love that PvZ is casual, but also requires strategy to send those zombies back to the grave. It's also quite amusing to see what new tricks the zombies have up their sleeves as you progress through each level. And Laura Shigihara's music fits perfectly with each section and time of day. This is truly one of the best games that I have ever played.			",8,4,0,2,1,0,1

-Quick Review-How to describe a game based on planting various plants, to keep the zombie apocalypse from getting into your house and eating your brains? Maybe “A Botanists guide to survive the zombie apocalypse”? Basically, the game is all about using different plants to keep various types of zombies away from your house. There are several different levels each with their own challenge.-Detailed breakdown review-Story:  The story itself is very short, there isn’t much to say about it either. The game goes by pretty quickly but it is a lot of fun to play. And if you’re trying to squeeze out even more time, there are some great mini games to play. The “Whack a zombie”, might have given me carpal tunnel someday.Game Play:  This is a strategy game, so you will need to select the plants you want to use, then place them in various orders that will hopefully ward off the hoards of zombies. Most of the games start slow, and really pick up in pace. Achievements: As I do for all my reviews, I also make note of the different achievements in the game  and the work to get them. To be honest I don’t’ really remember how difficult these achievements were. Most of them were unlocked as you played the game, although there were a few that required some setup. All in all, the achievements wouldn’t be a reason to get this game; this game would be fun with or without achievements. (I can hear everyone on my friends list gasp right now)Price: Plants vs. Zombies is normally $9.99 and I personally put 81 hours into the game, so in my mind that’s a fair trade, although it never hurts to wait for a 50% or 75% off sale. Occasionally older games like this go on 90% off sales, so it would be best to wait till then to get the most out of your money. However you wouldn’t be disappointed if you simply bought it right away. Conclusion:  I loved this game, it was a very simple, short game but I squeezed a lot of time out of it. As far as the game is concerned I consider this one a “must buy”, at some point in your steam life.			",141,13,3,13,8,0,23

												It was my favourite when i was a kid, and it still is. It's honestly suprising how a game with such a simple context can be so enjoyable. Sure, it doesn't offer too much replay value but it's still fun to play it through every once in a while. The soundtrack is just flawless. I just adore the amount of love and passion that has been put into this game.I would definitely recommed this to anyone who enjoys tower defense type games, but this game is just so much more than just an ordinary tower defense.Probably the only con is that the game often fails to run at Windows 10. There are ways to go around the crashes though.For the sequels in ths franchise, i wouldn't recommend them at all. It's just sad to watch how EA managed to ruin a franchise with so much potential. This game will always be the #1 from any current and future Plants VS. Zombies titles for me.In conclusion, definitely atleast try this out. There's also a free demo available if you want to try it before purchasing. The game only costs around five bucks.			",45,7,0,3,2,1,9

												An incredibly entertaining game that is a must-have for hard-core and casual gamers alike!  After the standard levels the game offers sufficient ""puzzle"" challenges and mini-games to ensure near endless replayability.  A bargain at twice the price!  Best money I ever spent on a game twice (After playing it to death on PC I later purchased it on another platform)!			",147,66,1,29,17,2,42

												This is an addictive tower defense style game. It is a great game on first two playthroughs but it doesn't have the best replay value after completion. After adventure mode, puzzles, and the mini-games have been completed, one is left with only survival mode. It is still fun, though, trying different defensive configurations in an attempt to survive through more flags in Survival: Endless. I give PVZ 4/5 *'s			",52,2,0,3,0,0,6

												Go back to a simplier time where Microtransactions are non-existant and games are ACTUALLY games. Plants vs Zombies is a Tower Defense where you plant sentient plants against hordes of zombies. Despite the name, it's actually fun where you can plant a variety of flora, ranging from evil looking mushrooms that is the equivalent of a mini nuke to literal pea shooter plants all while being guarded by a literal wall-nut. Tons of fun content and it's also $5.			",80,13,0,2,2,2,15

												This game was really good but the sequel was♥♥♥♥♥♥ i'm not saying you cant make it better but PvZ is such a nostalgic game because its realease was 7 years ago but the sequel, even though it did good in thee markets, it was not good enough for me and i am not blind in this situation as i have completed both games. I beat PvZ 1 about 7 times and PvZ 2 once. This is not coming out of nostalgia this is coming from the style the stuff implemeented were fine, the thing that really put me in a weird spot was the fact that stylistically the game did not exactly improve or strive in the subjects it was focusing on in PvZ 1. You had 7 years of room for improvement, I expected something better, but you can still make it up  in PvZ 3 or PvZ Heroes. It was a good run			",46,15,0,7,4,2,5

												Plants vs. Zombies is an extremely simple tower defense game. It is very easy to learn and complete and even though some of the challenges provide some higher level of difficulty it is not enough to give the game any sort of longevity.The sound and graphics are heavily linked to the humor of the game which also happens to be one of the strong points of the game. Although the quality is that of a mobile game the artstyle is cute and interesting enough to forgive that.Plants vs. Zombies is a fun little game that most people will enjoy but few will love. It's is the quintessential AAA casual game. Made with more development and public relations money than some major retail titles but geared towards the casual and mobile audiences.

												Garden Sun Plants And Zombies This game is very popular even though it's very old, I have to admit it's an awesome game, it's a fun story, it's entertaining, it's nice and short, and it contains zombies. A few downsides though, for a start there is no controller support for this game, and it also has no adjustable graphics, so the screen is shocking, you can have a massive TV, but the game will give you an image so it wont fit the whole TV screen, this can be frustrating. Alot of hours can be had with it, and the game is cheap as it gose on sale alot, I picked this up for 85p.I have to recommend this game.			",3,4,0,1,0,0,1

												Interesting take on tower defense.  Zombie theme is well done, game is funny but tactical.  Decent if not spectacular graphics, doesn't need a graphics card.  Main adventure mode is a little short, a good player can complete adventure mode in 3 hours or so.  But there are a lot of side minigames you can unlock and play.  There is an endless survival mode that can soak up dozens of hours strategizing.  Low memory requirement.  Tied with FTL for my favorite light game.			",1,1,0,2,1,0,3

												This is not only a very good tower defence game, but one of the most creative games I have ever seen, both in terms of its gameplay and its many types of humour sprinkled throughout. After having played through it, it is quite evident that the team behind this game is a creative bunch, and it truly adds to the overall experience.As for the game itself, it provides you with a metric ton of towers, which allows for an almost endless amount of strategies and experimentation, and equally many types of enemies, which gives you variation. It also has a bunch of mini-games and challenges if the standard game becomes too repetitive, and a garden to tend to so you can earn more cash, amongst other things.The campaign starts with the very basics and ramps up the difficulty and complexity of the game at a good pace. You are rewarded for experimenting with towers to make your own strategies, so if you ever get stuck, change your strategy around to take care of the zombies or waves you have issues with. You will learn a lot that way, which will become useful later, and it will also make you feel good with the sense of mastery it gives you.Considering how much content you get from this game, it is well worth the price tag even before any discounts, assuming you like tower defence games or strategy games in general, and even if you don't, this is the perfect place to start if you want to get more familiar with the genre.

A tale of flora, undead britons, and a psychopathic neighbor named Dave, Plants vs. Zombies GOTY Edition is a Masterpiece of modern software. This pulchritudinous game uses the newly developed ""Frostbite"" game engine by Mojang Studios. With this new engine, the game has stunning visuals of a province of the superstate Oceania in a world of perpetual war, omnipresent government surveillance, and public mind control, dictated by a political system euphemistically named English Socialism. Along with beauteous graphics Plants vs. Zombies GOTY Edition displays the compelling story of Dave, the last Emperor of China, who has to defend his karesansui from imperialistic westerners seeking his asiatic intellect.

Plants vs. Zombies is an excellent time killer but not much else (at least for me).Grab this game on sale, I don't recommend purchasing it at the regular 5 dollar price. There's really not a whole of lot of content here.That's not to say I don't like the game, I do, but I got bored pretty quickly.Pros- Levels range from easy all the way to somewhat challenging (This game isn't that hard)- Hilarious game!- Everything elseCons- Game has tendency to get pretty boring after a while- Best played in a window, Fullscreen has terrible quality (There is no way to change the resolution)My Rating: 7/10 (Recommended for those rainy days) ",89,5,0,7,3,0,5

												I consider myself a pretty big Plants vs. Zombies fan having played through all of the games multiple times. That being said going back to the start and playing this GOTY Edition makes me realize I really want another plants vs zombies game that's not a shooter. I love the Garden Warfare series, but that's no reason not to give us release of both. The more fans the better right?If any of you are not familiar with PVZ yet this is the perfect place to start.  it really is as simple as Plants vs. Zombies.			",375,144,14,85,57,11,89

Alternative edition of gardener simulatorAmazingly fun playing. The story starts out as a zombies come on your property, all you have to defend yourself is a gatling pea. Zombies come in all sizes. Some even ride vehicles. They all have one destination, your house.			",270,47,11,25,15,1,25

												Plants vs. Zombies GOTY Edition– Raymond KT*EDITED AND UPDATED!!*“Zombies are invading your home, and the only defense is your arsenal of plants! Armed with an alien nursery-worth of zombie-zapping plants like peashooters and cherry bombs, you'll need to think fast and plant faster to stop dozens of types of zombies dead in their tracks”If I do say so myself, I was a much larger fan of this when it wasn’t so mainstream. But regardless, I still am a fan of Plants vs. Zombies. Unfortunately, Plants vs. Zombies Game of the Year (I’ll abbreviate this GotY from now on) isn’t a sequel at all. There are no new zombies, no new plants, no new levels. Instead it feels more like a series of bug fixes, including a curious change where the dancing zombies have been replaced by disco zombies “per the request from the Michael Jackson estate” which In my opinion was a bad move but whatever. Nothing really changed from the original besides a feature called “Zombatar” or something like that. Still a great game.I recommend this game			",106,29,6,13,24,1,11

												Brains...', attacks as the best form of defence, big variety of cute killer plants, dead, congenial people with dental problems, situations of weird humor, a very crazy neighbour, different locations to come into conflict with ur dead, green 'friends' and so on - that's PLANTS vs. ZOMBIES. Play it (or use ur time much more efficient but without !such! FUN!)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												ZOMBIIES... ARE COMIIING...This game is really great. Tower defense at it's best.You use plants as towers to defend your house, and there are lots of levels, enemies and finally a boss.When you beat him, you will also unlock bunch of minigames and puzzles - including survival mode etc.First time when i played this, it was not on Steam. I beat all the extras, and even tried to grow tree in my garden( which would take months, literally)For friend of tower defence games - Buy it - it is great.For friend of zombies - Buy it or zombies will eat your brainz.

												Plants Vs Zombies is a really, really fun game. The artwork is very cute and original, the “storyline” is worth a chuckle. This game really shines in the gameplay department. You fight to protect your home by planting plants onto your lawn, which attack zombies for you. Different plants do different attacks as well as different zombies do different amounts of damage as well. You need sun to grow things, and the dynamics of the game flow beautifully. The sound effects are on par, and just when you get bored, the game adds more features for you to play with. There are plenty of mini games and even a survival and puzzle games as well. Mac compatible, this game is a great play. My only complaint is that it is quite difficult to earn money in this game to purchase upgrades. Maintain your zen garden and I’m sure it gets easier. 9/10			",165,106,8,26,37,3,19

												Okay, so, I have managed to put a few hours into this simple game now but my god, is it addictive. From batting off football zombies and protecting your lawn with ferocious plants to growing trees with Crazy Dave, it is a very fun game indeed and is great for filling in time. For me personally, I play it a lot whilst waiting for something else download and you find you can pass time so easily with it. The story mode is fun and many challenges will be faced there but you've got mini games and survival which will last forever if you allow it meaning you'll accumalate countless hours like me. It's a game worth buying. Only one draw back is it's max resolution but apart from that, it's worth the money. Now go save your back yard before the zombies eat your BRAINS!			",67,3,3,3,6,0,3

Still playable though so get it if you don't have a smartphone already (the two of you out there). Or when it's on special, but get the smartphone version anyways, trust me I have both...Still a good game though. ",197,62,4,24,1,3,11

												Great game from my childhood, it's nice to revisit it. I always seem to get random desires every so often to come back and play like Sims 3 and I appreciate a game that can make me feel that. Set up a mean green line of defense against an undead army. It's quite cute and cartoony but also childish, but of course it is aimed towards kids. Can get quite challenging and your victories make you feel satisfied.			",134,24,1,13,18,1,8

												I LOVE. THIS GAME! Plants vs. Zombies is a clever little cartoon Tower Defense game with a charm! Campaign ModeLevels are paced perfectly, getting harder and harder, with differentiating worlds. Completing each level unlocks different plants to use against the ever so dumb zombies. Unlocking plants never feels like you are growing more powerful, but feels like your arsenal is getting larger. If you unlock a new plant, you have to adapt to the playstyle of that plant...not the other way around. This simple, yet powerful mechanic makes complete each and every level feel SO satisfying. Extra ModesBowling, Bombs, and Bejeweled...yup! Loads of fun! Extra modes also include the ability to play: As a zombie...quite hard!In an endless mode (Beat my score, I DARE you!)Challenge maps in each ""World"" (Different areas of your house)Fun!Zen GardenAs you play the game, you get money, spend money to raise plants and soak away 90 hours of your life making your garden the most beautiful garden on the block and beat off all the kids away from it...

												This game is a beautiful classic, the easy atmosphere combined with the fun and relaxing gameplay makes it perfect for the casual gamer. It is a wonderfull game that will have a special place in the minds of almost everyone who played it. This game was a part of my childhood. And I enjoy it to this day.However, if you are a challenge-seeking player, I wouldn't recommend this game because the difficulty is easy for kids and gameplay gets a little bit repetitive after a while. I finished the main campaign (adventure mode) in around 5 hours after I bought it a month ago from steam.You can pick it up and play it anytime you want and put it down again anytime you want, you can pause and the game will autosave at any point. it's a fun and relaxing game you can play in your freetime.

												As of the time I am writing this I am going to NY in a car. So I had to play this and a couple other games on the way their. I have played the game a lot and beat the game twice on the PC and have played on the xbox also and beat the game once, And I just started this because it was a sale and I didn't have anything else to buy. Anyways time for the review:STORYThe story is simple and it is told simple. Zombies invaded your house and you need to defend it. With the help from plants and crazy dave you have to defend your house and defeat the zombies. Kinda cheesy but at the time it was the bomb.GAMEPLAYUse plants to kill zombies and unlock even more plants to kill more zombies. Play minigames from time to time and unlock survival mode to continue the onslaught.GREATTower defense done rightGOODOriginal IdeaOriginal plant IdeasBADStory is very slowMinigames and survival take too long to unlockWORSESame thing repeated over and overCant repeat levelsIn the end the game starts out as fun but gets very boring and repeated. Beat he game as fast as you can and unlock survival mode and play the minigames. Other then that you can't find much here. It is a very good and small game for anyone on a trip and such.

One of the best casual gamesThis is possibly the best cassual game i have ever played. In this simple tower defense you just play rounds and rounds of plant planting so you defeat the waves of zombies. It is rly the best so i will pinpoint only few bad things about this game.It will consume tons of your time to get everything your plants desire to defeat the zombies. Its fun, though quite stereotypical, especially when you are decided to hunt the achievements. There are some minigames, puzzles and game modes which try break the pattern but as soon as you complete them all, you are back to the zombie killing. GOOD things:  Funny Minigames, Mods, ... BAD things:  After a while it gets quite stereotypical ",1139,403,32,139,117,14,186

												This is a pretty messed up game.  Right off the bat we're told that the player needs to stop the zombies from entering his home and eating his brains.  Yet, right after this the player is given control of planting vegetation in his front yard.  If you let a zombie into your home it eats your brain, even if you're in mid plant.  How is this possible?  If I'm in my home, how can I be planting plants?  You never actually see a representation of yourself planting said plants either.  Are they alluding the idea that I'm some kind of God, capable of planting plants unseen, and able to relax in my home at the same time?  If this is true, then why dont I just crush the zombies?  Why toy with them?  Zombies represent humankind, the plants clearly represent nature.  This game is telling every player to bring the world back to its roots.  Get rid of the brainless humans, and let the powerful, just plants (nature) rule the world once more.  Pretty messed up that kids are being brainwashed by this.			",291,47,0,52,17,2,39

This is basically a perfect game: simple yet deep, fun yet challenging. What won me over was the charm. This game oozes charm: the graphics, animations, music, and brilliantly written almanac entries. It's all so well-done. The game is a bit too easy, but the joy of it all makes up for that. One of the greatest games ever created! A must-play for all gamers!			",322,70,5,41,12,3,36

Sure it sounds outrageous, how in the heck could plants take down the onslaught of the mindless freaks?  How.....you need to play this game to find out, watch out for the Crazy Dave character, I never trust someone wearing a pot on his head or is later seen dancing with the zombies! Popcap truely has a very unique perspective to games and I really like that, I hope they get away from the Free 2 Play stuff they are putting out again, I have always thought that concept was a complete crash.

												We've got to hand it to PopCap. They've perfected the hit-the-happy-centre-of-your-brain skill. Plants vs. Zombies is easy to learn, has great depth, and is balanced so well as to leave you always wanting one more challenge. Great for a quick blast through a level, or for grinding away for hours. It backs up the gameplay with plenty of personality. It's cute without being (too) creepy.The ""Game of the Year Edition"" adds all sorts of weird and addictive mini-games. Another thing that PopCap does well.			",166,29,4,24,18,4,34

Many new modes unlocked throughout a game, refreshing if you get used to previous levels. You just have to pass the first missions where there is little variety and then the game explodes with new levels, modes and - of course, the most important - plants and zombies :)			",147,22,1,31,21,4,76

												The game that captivated an entire generation. Despite being a PC release it modernzed mobile gaming when it came to iOS. Absolutely one of the best ""Tower Defense"" style games out there. Even people who aren't generally fans of the genre can find a lot to love about it. As a puzzle game it's perfection, you wont find yourself coming back to it much after it's completed. But this is common of games in this style. It's a great classic to this day and deserves your attention.			",388,95,9,67,29,5,24

												This is best 'Tower Defence' game I ever played! 10/10 mark from me.Very nice visual part with smart and interesting game play. Gameplay is more casual then hardcore, but there are still moments when you need use your brain to pass the level. I like, that game require strategy skills, but not 'click fast or lose'.There are several strategies of passing same levels, so game is 're-playable'.Game looks and feels very well done, with nice humor.Hope it will be more such quality 'Tower Defence' games.-------------------------If developers read this, some ideas for add-ons and DLCs:- It would be realy great to have 'Survival endless' mods for every type of environment, not only for 'day pool'- Same idea true for 'I zombie' mode - more environments and more type of zombies!- I'd realy like to see more achivements for game, don't see any troubles with adding them in such type of game- Why no DLC with additional levels available? I and other fans of the game are ready to pay for more fun!			",52,20,1,14,5,2,10

												It's one of those games you just have to love. A combination of strategy, adorable graphics, this game can be simple 5 minute quick play, or something you could play for hours. The learning curve makes it very accessible, while the possibilities (when you've unlocked a lot of the plants at least) of different combinations of plants in your arsenal gives you a lot of room for setting up an offence to match your personal style. The mini games are a ton of fun, and of course, it's worth playing it alone for Crazy Dave.			",97,12,2,12,8,0,6

												I'm sure you've heard some people talk about what they would do in a Zombie Apocolypse right? They talk about dual-wielding machetes or building fortifications with sniper towers or driving around in a Death Bus kitted out with Machine Guns and spikes on the front and... wait this sounds familiar. ANYWAY after playing this game you can tell them what YOU would do to defend yourself without fail: grow Plants. In this game, you must defend your house from countless waves of 25 different kinds of Zombies (all being sent at you by the Evil Dr. Edgar George Zomboss) using your arsenal of 40 Plants (plus 9 Bonus plants that can be purchased later on). As you play through Adventure Mode, you defend your Front Yard, Back Yard and even Roof (Both at Day AND Night)! After Adventure Mode, you unlock many different ways to play, including Endless Survival Mode, which all make for countless hours of fun. I hope you enjoy this game as much as I have!

												Again, I'm gonna do another minireview, this time on Plants vs. Zombies. Plants vs. Zombies is a game that I wholy advise you to get. Sure it is just another tower defense game, but it's executed in such a way that you'll find yourself unable to ever get away from it (and this comes from someone who is practically sick of tower defense games).The music is great, it loops but it's not annoying and you can very rarely tell if it has restarted or not. PvZ has a TON of humor and great characters. Give it a spin (try the demo even) but I really advise you to just go buy the full game.Verdict: BUY			",651,177,40,79,76,8,92

The perfect game. The first time I played Plants vs. Zombies was around 2009 when it came out. Back then I didn't own the Steam version but that didn't stop me from completing the game and most of the mini-games and puzzles it offered. I found the game very easy to get into - yet astonishing because it offered such a great variety of clever ideas, puzzles, challenges - all that and more. At some point I reinstalled my system and along with that I lost the game and my progress.Later on in 2011 I bought the Steam version. Some time had passed after the first play-through so I started anew with the game - and I wasn't disappointed. I loved every minute of it. The great thing with this game is that you can play it through so many times and it still doesn't fail to surprise you. Up to this day I still have those moments when I just feel the urge to play this game again - and then I go ahead and do play it. The fact that this game features Steam Cloud is just magnificent. I can continue playing on my laptop when I am not at home! And did I even mention the achievements? They are a game maker here, too.Oh, and I also bought this game for my Windows Phone. This game was my savior during boring math classes. I beat the game - too bad I didn't pass the math course...			",179,47,6,11,24,0,25

												Fun concept, great setup, EXTREMELY difficult to get the badges.  you pretty much have to get one every level you play otherwise you will not achieve them all.  that being said, the plants that you have for the begining levels make it impossible to get any good badges.  if they lowered the difficulty of them, say instead of getting 50 kills in one level using only cherry bombs, to something like 20 kills, fully worht trying to collect badges.  That being said, still reccomend heartily as a fun game, and would suggest it to anyone looking for a funny tower defense game.			",20,2,0,12,0,0,4

												This is a tower defense game with plants. The objective of the game is to stop the zombies from reaching your house and eating your brains. Its a simple concept that can really be entertaining. This game bring humor and creativity to a whole new level. There are quite a few different ways to defend the house, the selection to possibilities are endless. You can time attacks or be prepared for the future and place all your plants everywhere. Some of the achievements require you to play the game through twice which can take awhile. The the game is entertaining and fun. If you love a tower defense style of gameplay then this is a definite game to have in your collection.			",3039,1134,139,314,429,33,477

												Obviously the big disappointment here is that the sequel went out as a mobile only game. *cries* I'm not normally a fan of tower defense games which I think this sort of qualifies as, but between the funny zombies, cute plants, awesome theme tune and of course the mini games and zen garden for when you just want to chill and watch Stinky the snail earn his keep.... all in all there is enough to keep you amused for a long time. Or you can just get the f2p sequel on your phone. *sigh* I actually own this one three separate platforms now...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Plants Vs Zombies is an amazing game that gives you alot of bang fot your buck. The game starts off slow, but once it gets going, it never stops. New plant and zombie types are introduced every level to keep you on your toes. A strategy that worked in one level could become useless in the next. Minigames unlocked after the game is done offer immence replay value. Tying the entire package together is a great sence of humor that never grows old or hits a sour note.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's one of those games you just have to love. A combination of strategy, adorable graphics, this game can be simple 5 minute quick play, or something you could play for hours. The learning curve makes it very accessible, while the possibilities (when you've unlocked a lot of the plants at least) of different combinations of plants in your arsenal gives you a lot of room for setting up an offence to match your personal style. The mini games are a ton of fun, and of course, it's worth playing it alone for Crazy Dave.			",97,12,2,12,8,0,6

												Pretty sure everyone's played this game either on the computer of phone before. Each has a slightly unique feature but the game is essentially the same thing on both. i didn't ask for this game but got it anyway it's such a good game. With a price tag of $10 i guess it's sort of worth it but if you have it on IOS there's no point in buying this game. Play as zombies or plants pick your side and plan what your going to use they should have a versus mode which would be fun but the game isn't bad and not pricey deece game 6/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A brilliant and easy tower defense game where you will defend you’re self against a massive horde of zombies, and where your only defense is mutated killer plants!It’s a game that can be enjoyed by everyone of all ages from the youngst to oldest and will never feel boring to play do to the 50 levels in adventure mode that varies from day, night, and fog, in a swimming pool and on the rooftop. And trueout the game you will unlock a lot of different mini games and puzzles that really spices up the game, you even get to play as the zombies.I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to have fun, I have passed the 300 hours played mark and I’m still playing the game because it’s just as fun as when I bought it! :Dhow ever, be aware of the fact that the company that made the game was bought from its original owners and is now owned by EA (which means that the game will never get any updates, it was supose to have gotten alot more content but the moment the old company was bought the staff was fired and every single content that was planned was scrapped)It's still a good game though, and I highly recommend it, especially if you can get it on a hand held devices (they got a ton of content added)			",257,18,6,20,22,4,26

												Again, I'm gonna do another minireview, this time on Plants vs. Zombies. Plants vs. Zombies is a game that I wholy advise you to get. Sure it is just another tower defense game, but it's executed in such a way that you'll find yourself unable to ever get away from it (and this comes from someone who is practically sick of tower defense games).The music is great, it loops but it's not annoying and you can very rarely tell if it has restarted or not. PvZ has a TON of humor and great characters. Give it a spin (try the demo even) but I really advise you to just go buy the full game.Verdict: BUY			",651,177,40,79,76,8,92

												Plants vs. zombies is a great game.  Dont judge the game by the way it looks, it can get hecktic.  Plants vs. zombies is a great game for strategy players.  The game has a wide and creative assortment of different plants to use for different levels.  The story is however not the strong poing.  Basically all you do is deffend you house from zombies that get increasingly hard as the game goes on.  Even though the story is not a key part in this game it's hard to complain about anything else in this game.  Michael brown gives this game a 9 out of 10.			",6,0,0,1,1,0,1

The perfect game. The first time I played Plants vs. Zombies was around 2009 when it came out. Back then I didn't own the Steam version but that didn't stop me from completing the game and most of the mini-games and puzzles it offered. I found the game very easy to get into - yet astonishing because it offered such a great variety of clever ideas, puzzles, challenges - all that and more. At some point I reinstalled my system and along with that I lost the game and my progress.Later on in 2011 I bought the Steam version. Some time had passed after the first play-through so I started anew with the game - and I wasn't disappointed. I loved every minute of it. The great thing with this game is that you can play it through so many times and it still doesn't fail to surprise you. Up to this day I still have those moments when I just feel the urge to play this game again - and then I go ahead and do play it. The fact that this game features Steam Cloud is just magnificent. I can continue playing on my laptop when I am not at home! And did I even mention the achievements? They are a game maker here, too.Oh, and I also bought this game for my Windows Phone. This game was my savior during boring math classes. I beat the game - too bad I didn't pass the math course...			",179,47,6,11,24,0,25

												I have only one thing to say about PVZ, its a must have, it is addicting, witty fun.  Sure it sounds outrageous, how in the heck could plants take down the onslaught of the mindless freaks?  How.....you need to play this game to find out, watch out for the Crazy Dave character, I never trust someone wearing a pot on his head or is later seen dancing with the zombies! Popcap truely has a very unique perspective to games and I really like that, I hope they get away from the Free 2 Play stuff they are putting out again, I have always thought that concept was a complete crash.  Who wants to keep paying for a game.  I like to pay my money up front! - P.S. Don't eatch the magic taco, you will pay for it! ;)			",378,85,12,27,60,8,29

												Again, I'm gonna do another minireview, this time on Plants vs. Zombies. Plants vs. Zombies is a game that I wholy advise you to get. Sure it is just another tower defense game, but it's executed in such a way that you'll find yourself unable to ever get away from it (and this comes from someone who is practically sick of tower defense games).The music is great, it loops but it's not annoying and you can very rarely tell if it has restarted or not. PvZ has a TON of humor and great characters. Give it a spin (try the demo even) but I really advise you to just go buy the full game.Verdict: BUY			",651,177,40,79,76,8,92

												This game rocks. I got addicted to it from the WoW knock-off quest. I say addicted because I even got it for my Xbox so I could do the achievements all over again, and then I got it for free on Origin and did the same. I also beat the little quest line on WoW on all of my different characters because the quest isn't repeatable on WoW.If you like strategy, tower defense, and zombies, give this a try. It has a main play/adventure mode, and also tons of different game modes that are equally fun and frustrating. I mean really, it’s only around 5 bucks at full price and it's one of the few games I would have been willing to have paid even more for. Also, if you love this game, the Xbox version has a few different features that are kind of cool.This game isn't too difficult to get 100% on achievements, but it does take a bit of time. It isn't one of those games you can get 100% in 5 to 8 hours, and you also might want to beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of your keyboard for some of them, but I still love it. :D ",186,87,0,38,21,2,35

												Technically, PvZ is a casual game, but -if you're like me- you may find yourself going back to it more than casually. I won't bore you with things you already know, but I was EXTREMELY impressed by the amount of content you get with the GOTY edition. Most of the mini-games you have to unlock by beating the main game, but this is hardly a negative. The main 'adventure mode' took me about 17 hrs to complete. (If I had to guess: For most people, it probably takes closer to 8.5 hours. Yeah I'm that slow, lol.)Anyway, lots of different plants at your disposal, along with many different types of zombies to take down. And I don't want to ruin any surprises, but you really just have to believe me on the great amount of content with this game. I mean, there are still hours and hours left of things to do after the main adventure.Bottom line: Fun game. Easy-to-pick-up gameplay. Insanely good replay value. I can easily recommend this game. :D			",258,22,12,21,8,0,7

												This game is so addictive! Not to mention the art is cute too. It is amazing to see new plants with new abilities on each stage in the adventure mode. This make you keep playing to see what plant you get next. It also gives you multiple ways to strategize how to kill your zombies the way you like it. The crazy dude inside the game is a great way to tell the player how to survive in this zombie game too. I love the sunflower that sing “there is a zombie on your lawn”. Overall, it is awesome.

												Lots of fun. Very original game . I originally found it back in... what was it.... 2009? Yes , that must have been it. I suppose. Either way, it had just come out. I was playing feeding frenzy or something and figured the people who made that must make other good games or something. And , boy , did they!        I got the game and was immediatly thrust into something I didn't understand and hadn't seen before. It explained itself, though. As I was gaining more rows of grass, I thought about the possibilities of this game design.       For quite a few years, me and my father wondered if a sequel would come out. It made so much sense. We came up with all kinds of funny ideas.                                                                                  .............                                                                              My Condolences                   What came after that game was not a part of that franchise at all. It was a monster. It came out and was free to pay. It was IOS exclusive. Then it came to android after way too f*cking long. It still isn't available on PC. So, uh, turns out EA bought popcap.      Now I get it...			",150,20,3,15,13,0,11

												Plants vs. Zombies is a twist on the traditional Tower Defence genre, being narritive driven and intuitive, but also easy to learn with nuances to master, so players of all skill ranges can enjoy it, from your mum to the elite pro's of Starcraft.Serious time:You play as a humble homeowner, who owns five lawnmowers for some reason, who happened to buy a house behind a cemetery, where the titular zombies pour forth. Now you, with your neighbour Crazy Dave (or you can just call him Crazy Dave) and all the seeds you could grab from the garden centre must stop the zombies from entering your house and EATING YOUR BRAINS!There's a variety of plants to choose from which you earn as you progress through the game, and there's a vast plethora of Zombies to see and get eaten by, from regulars to those who look like Micheal Jackson. Gameplay's simple: Get some sunlight, plant some...plants, and kill some MOTHER, ♥♥♥♥ING, ZOMBIES!It's genuinely funny. Along with an artstyle so adorable it's probably illegal, just looking through the Suburban Almanac (a book that contains info on all the plants and zombies you've seen so far), there's certainly enough giggles in there alone, and that's not even mentioning the shenanigans Crazy Dave gets up too, when he's not flogging you stuff from the back of his car (spoilers!).I suppose the only real failing of PvZ is that it's designed for casual play, so isn't particularly difficult, both a blessing and curse. After a while, it does get a bit 'samey', even with new plants and zombies to plant and kill respectively. Eventually you'll get a routine going for each level, so it can become a bit monotunous at times.8/10 - Simple gameplay, nice artstyle.			",39,6,0,2,8,0,1

												This game has definitely aged well; the only way you can tell that it's old is that it's not widescreen.  The main story is a very addicting defense game that takes several hours to beat.  I was impressed by how they managed to introduce a new mechanic on nearly every level without it being overwhelming.Other than the main story, there are tons of fun minigames and other game modes which give the game a lot more depth than it would've had otherwise.

												I'll be honest. I pirated the♥♥♥♥♥♥of this game when I was young. But with Steam here right now doing an 80% off. I see no reason to not support it. Even with the Popcop buyout and EA ruining the series, I'd still give them my $1 but only that due to nostalgia. Nevertheless this game is as good as it get. If you like Strategy/Tower Defense games, this one is for you.It doesn't matter if you're a noob, this game will teach you!Just get it. ",82,10,4,10,1,0,9

												Plants vs Zombies is a true classic in the making, Its a no brainer that this game is amazing and fun to play all the way to the end, it has many mini games and then the campaign mode, this is a casual game that re-imagines the tower defense games. Build plants, stop zombies from eating your brains,and meet a crazy man? The game shows you which zombies you will face before you pick your plants, so you can make the wise choice. There is an amazing amount of plants to use, a ton of zombies to use them all on with their unique abilities and usage. As the game progresses it gets harder to decide which plants to pick for the onslaught of zombies to come. It actually does bring out a bit of hardcore gaming, but it is aimed at the whole family. This game won a Game Of The Year award and deserves it too, it truly a amazing game with little to no flaws, lots of humor and references to other real life material. It's worth your money by a long shot.			",603,161,18,61,52,4,69

												Игра очень хорошая и оригинальная. Время и плохое настроение убивает напрочь. Да уж, где еще увидишь как стреляющий горох убивает едущего на него зомби. В игре придется также проявить свои умственные способности, продумать стратегию защиты, план по которому мы будем даже наступать на яростных зомби. Есть уровни - бонусы и игры повышенной сложности, где вам действительно придется непросто. Я играл в эту игру с большой радостью. Надеюсь и вам она принесет много позитива. Вы не пожалеете если уделите время этой игре. ",407,84,17,38,13,2,42

												By far, one of the best indie games ever made. I started playing Plants vs Zombies on the phone and when it was released on steam i bought it immediately, with the idea to complete the game once again. I had so much fun, like if it was the first time :DThe graphics are really pleasant, the mechanics well achieved and the extra modes add a couple of interesting features to the story mode, preventing the gameplay to get too boring. Some nice quality time spent with this. RECOMMENDED! :)			",848,304,23,72,70,8,112

												Really like this game a lot as I've played the mobile version for countless hours while on the bus or toilet. I got this in the Steam winter sale 2014 and though I've not played the PC version it is a game I can recommend. The only issue I have with this version is that the GFX have not been updated (I Guess) from the flash version and looks ugly as fudge in full screen mode and in window mode the play area is about 7Inch². So for GOTY Edition I would have liked to have seen a HD version or at least some improvement. All in all its a hole lot of fun.I'd reccomend buying at a price point at or below £2 because of the above reasons.			",160,13,5,22,20,0,18

												A pretty fun tower defense game that allows for some creativity. I just wish there were more missions that let you play how you wanted to play rather than having to adapt to certain scenarios (I'm looking at you, night levels).			",60,11,0,20,3,0,9

												By far, one of the best indie games ever made. I started playing Plants vs Zombies on the phone and when it was released on steam i bought it immediately, with the idea to complete the game once again. I had so much fun, like if it was the first time :DThe graphics are really pleasant, the mechanics well achieved and the extra modes add a couple of interesting features to the story mode, preventing the gameplay to get too boring. Some nice quality time spent with this. RECOMMENDED! :)			",848,304,23,72,70,8,112

												Classic game, very fun, sadly gets repetive quickly, especially in Story Mode. You could buy it when it's on sale because it gets very cheap, or you can get it for free on mobile in the app store. Or buy it full price if you want, but in my opinion it's not worth it.

OK, let's be more specific:- Nice visual style, sound and music.- Good sense of humor.- A large variety of awesome plants and items to play with.- Great set of different zombie types to fight against.- Interesting levels with original conditions, several additional game modes.I can't really think of any bads in the game.

												This game is great.Buy it.When you buy it make a cake.I'll tell you here: Gather your ingredients. Pound cake is one of the simplest cakes to bake. Here's what you'll need:1 cup unsalted butter, softened1 cup sugarPinch of salt2 teaspoons vanilla extract5 eggs2 cups cake flour2. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.3. Grease a cake pan. Pound cakes are best baked in deep pans, such as loaf pans or bundt pans.4. Cream the butter and sugar. Place the butter and sugar in a mixing bowl and beat them together until the mixture is light, fluffy and creamy.5. Add the eggs and vanilla. Keep beating the mixture until the eggs are completely incorporated.6. Stir in the cake flour. Keep the hand mixer on low or use a wooden spoon to stir the flour in a bit at a time until it's just incorporated. Be careful not to overmix it.7. Pour the batter into the pan. Use a spatula to scrape down the sides of the bowl.8. Bake the cake for an hour and 15 minutes. The cake is finished when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.Enjoy your cake!

												Plants vs. Zombies is a great game for all ages.  You will spend hours fighting against the zombie horde that wants to come onto your lawn...eat all of your plants and then come into your house to eat *gulp* your BRAINS!  In the beginning it's fairly easy, but once you start passing the medium levels the zombies become harder and harder.  But on your side you have an army of different plants thanks to the Sunflowers and the ""Solar Power"" that they get from the Sun.  Each plant has special abilities.  The name of the game is to use strategy when fighting the never ending horde of hungry zombies.  Not all zombies are the same.  Some use pogo sticks, others use balloons to fly in the air (very tricky if u ask me).  We also have backup dancers yaw.  Disco Inferno!  Heck, there are even zombies that scuba dive.  What the...?I love this game and I highly recommend it for the old skoolers as well as the new generation of players.  Plants vs. Zombies will not disappoint.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Plants vs. Zombies is a great game.  Especially enjoy all the mini games and puzzles that will keep you entertained for hours.  Top Tip.. when you get a garden full of plants use the chocolate bar on the snail to keep him going for an hour and leave it running so as to collect all the coins dropped.  Good way to earn some money ingame.			",21,0,0,0,4,0,2

												 Oh man, Plants vs. Zombies GOTYE, it blew my dang mind! When I saw a photo of it, I was like, ""That game looks odd."" Well, nowadays, I think this game is just so cool. The plants you can plant (especialy the gatling pea and cattail), the variety of zombies, heck, even the ACHIVEMENTS are cool. One of the thing I also have to like about this is the frickin' final boss music. It is so freaking awesome! Anyway, other than the adventure mode, there also is stuff like puzzles and even endless survival to keep you playing. One of the things I think the developer did so well on was the Zen Garden mode. The music is calm, and it can be fun growing the plants and collecting the money they give. Pretty much, for anyone who wants a good tower defense game, they should get Plants vs Zombies GOTYE. This game deserves a 10-10, and/or a 4.9-5 star rating, only because of the fact that the second time playing adventure mode, Crazy Dave will pick three plants that possibly would be useless. Still, this game is awesome. Enough said.			",32,5,0,3,7,3,2

												I've only recently purchased and installed the game, but am familiar with in from earlier on my phone. The game is a happy mix of several kinds of games in one. The main part consists of strategic fighting of zombies by the help of cute looking plants. On the side there are several mini games like zombie bowling and a slots game.Despite containing zombies this game is anything but scary and is easily suitable for people of all ages. The difficulty level increases per game, but is easy to handle if you practice a bit. When stuck look up the several plants and zombies in the almanac and come up with a new strategy to defeat the type of zombies bothering you.The pros of this game are:Very cute graphicsEasy to understand gameplayHumorSuitable for all agesI can't think of any cons. And at this price you almost feel like you are committing robbery in plain daylight. I can not understand it's this cheap! ",1,0,0,2,4,0,11

												While not the most challenging ""Tower Defense""-type game, it's the most complete experience from the genre. What do I mean? First off, it's charming. Cute, funny, bursting with character: It's just unqiue. Each zombie-type and plant has it's own little encyclopdia entry, often-times filled with the discarded dreams of zombie youth or a taste of plant family-drama. Second, it keeps your fingers busy even when it's being easy. I don't know about you, but I HATE having down-time in my games. YOU are the one responsible for collecting resources with a clickity-click (along with coins to unlock items) and is a welcome change from the passive reception of wealth in the genre.Third, there are loads of little fun mini-games and extras that the game encourages you master. Zombie-bowling anyone?So yeah, buy this game. The learning-curve is gentle (maybe a little bit too gentle!) and is a great starting point for anybody who is wondering what's so fun about Tower Defense games.			",152,33,2,33,14,0,19

Who wins? Everyone!Not only is Plants vs. Zombies a splendid candidate for anybody with an interest in exploring the gaming medium, it's perfectly suited to the type of no-commitment, speed-date, pick-up and play (then put away) gameplay people who hate video games, LOVE! Not to mention it's got the cool factor - ""Hey, I played that on my iDevice!""Great game. Right?Riiight. Seriously.			",1061,278,36,125,72,9,165

												What a charming tower defense title. The graphics are detailed and awesomely cute. Same goes for the sounds. And for such a low price you really get a lot of gameplay. There's just so much to do; puzzles, zen, adventure, mini-games, you name it. The game also has quite the zombie and plant collection, adding a lot of (strategic) depth to this already wonderful game. I'm not going to say anything else about it. You really have to experience it yourself.[Rating: 88/100]			",1661,635,69,221,194,16,225

												Plants vs. Zombies is a great game for all ages.  You will spend hours fighting against the zombie horde that wants to come onto your lawn...eat all of your plants and then come into your house to eat *gulp* your BRAINS!  In the beginning it's fairly easy, but once you start passing the medium levels the zombies become harder and harder.  But on your side you have an army of different plants thanks to the Sunflowers and the ""Solar Power"" that they get from the Sun.  Each plant has special abilities.  The name of the game is to use strategy when fighting the never ending horde of hungry zombies.  Not all zombies are the same.  Some use pogo sticks, others use balloons to fly in the air (very tricky if u ask me).  We also have backup dancers yaw.  Disco Inferno!  Heck, there are even zombies that scuba dive.  What the...?I love this game and I highly recommend it for the old skoolers as well as the new generation of players.  Plants vs. Zombies will not disappoint.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Definetly earned the right to be called a classic... this game's fame speaks for itself. Just like kids, old men, mothers, house wives and even werewolves will talk about it...A cool-looking-funny-epic-entertaining tower defense where you get to defend your lawn from zombies!!! using plants (pea shooters) damn! whatelse!??!?! seriously if this wasnt enough to get you playing then i suggest you go back to your boring ""word-hunt"" puzzles and ""see what character of X you are!"" type o'shI% this game is a must have for everyone... from noob babyfarts to epic foil-edition-PvP-headhunting-hardcore players...

												This is the FIRST plants vs zombies.This is NOT a pay to win game.This is NOT a pay to get upgrades game.This game is a full game, pay once, play for ever.All right?Now the game is simple.It has a funny scenario, hillarious plant and zombie descriptions,great sound fx, interesting music scores and very nice graphics.It is a tower-defence-concept game, where your plants in your garden, protect you from vicious zombies.Go figure. It is really fun to play, yet it is challenging.I REALLY recoomend this one.			",139,54,4,16,10,1,22

												This is my favorite game of 2009 and also my favorite tower defense game of all time! The graphics are amazing, the soundtrack is one of the best gaming soundtracks I have ever heard and overall this is the best game Popcap has made to date!There is only one con to this game. The Michael Jackson look alike zombie was removed in the Game of The Year Edition and was replaced with a 70s styled disco dancing, afro having, platform shoes wearing zombie. The Michael Jackson family threatened to sue Popcap for copyright of likeness if this was not done. I highly suggest you purchase a retail copy of the non Game of the Year Edition. Thankfully this update changes the gameplay in no form or fashion but definitely removes from the game's previous impecable personality!Overall 4.5 stars!			",3459,1327,149,358,473,43,548

												If you're the type of  gamer who enjoys a light-hearted, time-wasting, tower-defense kind of game that you can pop into whenever you have a few minutes, then this game is right up your ally.  AND, at less than ten bucks, you've really gotta ask yourself ""Why not buy this game?""Answer:  No real reason.  Go ahead and try the demo.  You know you want to....			",549,178,17,88,37,2,93

												An absolute classic!As ridiculous as this is, it's the same fun! In case you don't know the game yet you should definately check it out! Plants Versus Zombies is Zombie-survival in an entire new way. Who needs guns if they have Peashooters, Sunflowers, Potatomines and even Melonpults? This game works perfectly well as some little 2D strategy game. The mechanic consists of, well, planting plants, to defend your lawn from brain-eating Zombies. Who needs a background story if they have a neighbour called ""Crazy Dave"" who offers you helpful gadgets and cute little plants for the Zen-Garden?Despite beeing easy itself (at least easier than all other strategy games) this game will need it's time. Even if you are not an achievement collector, after having passed the main campain there are still challenges, minigames and Plants to try out... Or the ""Zombatar"" creator, just for messing around. Oh, and of course the ""Zen Garden""; which is basically a virtual glasshouse.In fact this game will be a lot of fun, will be replayable after years and is enjoyable for everyone. Despite this is about Zombies the game is freaking cute, humorous and funny. For 4,99$ PvZ is almost TOO cheap, but if possible get the retail version. It will feature better resolution, translations and merchandise. Plants Versus Zombies is a fun game with hand-made graphics, funny soundeffects and most important: Replaybility.Don't get fooled by the hillarious theme! When I said classic, I meant it that way! Don't miss this game, you'd regret it.			",67,20,1,1,5,0,6

												Is there someone who can't love this game? Funny, simple to play, entertaining.

												Playing this and many other Pop Cap games from my childhood, revisiting Plants vs. Zombies was one of the best choices I've made not that I have any terrible life choices or anything... shut up :( in a while. The mix of having a campaign for story, mini-games for some set aside fun, and zen mode to just work with the game at your own pace and enjoy something that requires no effort makes Plants vs. Zombies the exciting game that it already is.10/10 would find a way to keep Crazy Dave's magic taco...

												Deceptively simple and yet very fun. Better on a tablet but certainly worth getting on Steam if you don't have one. Game play consists of picking your available arsenal of plants, lining up on the grid and fending off rows of zombies with different characteristics. Has a delightfully humorous story, great art style and easy to learn, difficult to master mechanics. Also includes challenge maps and achievements which are always fun to play around with afterward.Well worth the cost: 4.5/5			",154,27,0,22,20,2,15

												This game deserves the title ""Game Of The Year"". It is a killer of a time watser. Sometimes I found myself going overtime while waiting for a multiplayer game to load! But for the price it has online and IOS it is definatley worth the money you pay for it. 100 out of 10 from me!			",63,3,0,5,3,2,1

												The be all and end all tower defence. Even though I often shy away from the genre of building towers to defend from waves of enemies Plants vs Zombies stands as one of my absolute favourite time sinks of all time.

												BUY THIS EXTRA SEED SLOT FOR $20,000,000I'M CRAAAAAZYThis is, yes, a ""casual"" tower defense game. It's also quite fun, with charming graphics and humor, and actually somewhat challenging in the later stages. You'll certainly have a lot of options and playstyles to choose from by then, at least.In PvZ, the dead have risen and they're coming for your brains. Luckily, you seem to have stolen several decades' worth of experimental plant seeds from the US government, which you must now use to defend your home from the undead menace. This is not actually the plot, but it's my headcanon.You must collect sun that drops from the sky (when it's daytime, that is) and from sun-generating plants. Sun is used to place your plants in various areas around your rather upscale home. The plants range from Peashooters to LSoH-esque Chompers to Potato Mines; you have a lot of ways to destroy the zeds. And you're going to need them, because these are apparently Romero-type zombies that know how to do stuff like bounce on pogo sticks, ride dolphins and whatever they can do to crush your organic defenses. (They sport Left 4 Dead-like mutations as well, but I'm getting ahead of myself.)The game is easy to pick up, but it'll throw some curveballs your way from time to time. Various additional modes and features are unlocked as you progress through the campaign for the first time, which is neat.I suppose a description of this game in a nutshell would be 'simple and fun, but not too simple, and pretty well-designed to boot'. It's probably a minor classic by this point. At the very least, it doesn't have microtransactions like its sequel.			",195,39,3,14,32,1,35

												I just finished my last session of playing. It was quite addictive playing, but I've done my playtime on it, and removed the game.For any that thinks bout buying it: its worth it, if you like the type of game. Its strategically using plants to counter incoming. I got up to bout 50 hours of gameplay total on it b4 I got tired of the game.Once I had a working strategy, the game became too easy tho. The unlocks help a lot with those (dual sunflower, quad peashooter, and upgrading spikeplants to counter the carts destroying them).The trick to make mucha money is playing to get plants, grow 'm full, and sell them for 8000 or more, buy 3 marigold plants from dave, grow 'm up, and keep day garden full of plants. Use the snail to collect coins, it stays collecting for about an hour after getting chocolate, so you can let it idle, Just sell couple expensive dropped plants at a time, and buy new from the shop.

												Easily summed up by one word; fun.Also great for short games, you can easily do a game in under 10 minutes. But if you want to spend a full night, I did pass one or 2 while finishing the storyline.And while it's generally not too difficult, some annoying zombies (dolphins, diggers, jumping zombies stealing plants) really need to have you pay attention and adopt appropriate strategies.

												This will be more of a story then reveiw but nevertheless it will be reveiwed:This was the second game on steam I bought, I remember my brother and stepbrother talking about it years back when it was popular (around '09 AD) and I being a bit out of contact with popular culture though it was still popular there I bought it.Was it worth it: Yes, and the game is actually quite fun, after doing some research on the game I was saddened that they removed the Micheal Jackson zombie due to legal issues but that aside it is a good tower defense game that while is no classic by any means is fun and worth the price but forward. (So get it, though I reccomend with the slight inflation to get it on sale if you are really wanting the game.)			",70,4,1,16,7,0,32

												The be all and end all tower defence. Even though I often shy away from the genre of building towers to defend from waves of enemies Plants vs Zombies stands as one of my absolute favourite time sinks of all time. Genuinly funny in it's quirkiness together with gameplay that moves from soothingly casual to intensely challenging in the later parts. 5/5			",796,340,22,82,72,15,125

												Easily summed up by one word; fun.Also great for short games, you can easily do a game in under 10 minutes. But if you want to spend a full night, I did pass one or 2 while finishing the storyline.And while it's generally not too difficult, some annoying zombies (dolphins, diggers, jumping zombies stealing plants) really need to have you pay attention and adopt appropriate strategies.

												I just finished my last session of playing. It was quite addictive playing, but I've done my playtime on it, and removed the game.For any that thinks bout buying it: its worth it, if you like the type of game. Its strategically using plants to counter incoming. I got up to bout 50 hours of gameplay total on it b4 I got tired of the game.Once I had a working strategy, the game became too easy tho. The unlocks help a lot with those (dual sunflower, quad peashooter, and upgrading spikeplants to counter the carts destroying them).The trick to make mucha money is playing to get plants, grow 'm full, and sell them for 8000 or more, buy 3 marigold plants from dave, grow 'm up, and keep day garden full of plants. Use the snail to collect coins, it stays collecting for about an hour after getting chocolate, so you can let it idle, Just sell couple expensive dropped plants at a time, and buy new from the shop.

												The game is not optimal for PC and it's a BIG downside that you can't play with controller. I've also played this game on Xbox 360 and I can tell you that using a controller is much more intuitive and suits the fast-paced gameplay much more (especially on the higher levels).However, it still is so fun to play. It is actually a rather short game, but it's worth it! Maybe buy it on a sale instead of full price. Really addictive!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Plants versus zombies, a big memory from my childhood. This game is such a classic. It's fun, has catchy music, and it's addicting. This version on Steam is TOTALLY worth the price (5 bucks) and I would REALLY recommend this game. Go buy it, it's a real time killer. Also, if you're on a laptop, you can play it during car trips. xD			",46,5,0,1,3,1,1

												A fun game for not - so - serious gamers. Not really any different from standard edition, and it can run very well on any computer. It has nice graphics and runs smoothly without any lag. This game won't take you long to complete, but you may get bored of it half way through.RATES - 7.5/10			",35,0,1,2,3,0,1

												Great game, but terrible resolution, especially in windowed mode. If you expect to multitask while playing this game, prepare to have a bad time. The only resolution available in windowed mode is so teeny that it's actually bothersome.http://prntscr.com/d1unijIf the resolution doesn't bother you, this game does boast a number of things that make it great.-Numerous different plants to aid you in fighting the zombies-Numerous different zombies to thwart your various plants-No in-app purchases (thus far in my playtime)-Fun design that brings you back time and time again-Game modes besides ""grind sun and plant like mad""Unfortunately, the lack of other resolutions bothers me so much that I have to thumbs-down it. If other resolutions become available for this game, I'll gladly change the recommendation. But the resolution really bothers me that much.			",89,18,3,15,9,0,7

												A fresh and unique take on the tower defense genre. Waves of unique and zany zombies come at you in lanes, while you plant your defenses to protect your home. There are hours of fun to be had in the main campaign and the mini games!			",398,74,18,43,33,5,66

												Incredibly good fun and extremely hilarious. It's sometimes the simple games like these that are among the best. It's not so easy that you won't feel challenged enough, but it's not so hard that you'll be pulling your hair out in frustration either.I highly recommend this game if you have not yet played it. It's a tower defense type of game, but very, very entertaining.			",314,142,6,31,21,0,34

												(Will change recommendation if problem is fixed.)So, for starters, I'll begin with the fact that this game is ... frankly awesome.The atmosphere is very enjoyable.+The Music is catchy+The levels start you off easy to get you used to the simple mechanics. Progressively getting more and more difficult.+In the same context of the previous positive, the levels also change as the game progresses. (Less aisles to place defenses. Day / Night. Fog. Square blockers [Places you can't put defense plants] Front yard, back yard, roof, pool etc.+Plethora of various plants you can choose from, level to level. [Same context, plenty of various zombies as well. That also get more challenging in their abilities or ""tricks"" you have to deal with]+Handful of mini-games to change the pace, when you're tired of this games equivelent of a story mode.Honestly, aside from the main reason I'm not recommending this game, I can think of very few negative aspects of game.  Which is namely the fact that I can't actually play the game for extended periods of time. Which I believe is more a personal aspect, as opposed to anything wrong with the game. As matches get harder, I find myself playing one or two levels and then giving it a break, and playing a different game.However, the extremely sad, and utterly heart breaking fact is that all of the above positives don't matter in the slightest, because you can't play the game. At all. Period. A recent update and it simply broke. You see the logo for Pop Games, and then you get a black screen. Nothing can be done except alt-tabbing out and closing, or alt-cntrl-dlt and closing the program that way. Such a huge let down. And it still hasn't been fixed, almost a month out (at the time of this review.)Yes ... I waited almost a full month, giving them the benefit of the doubt that they were fixing this. As stated, this review might very well change, and quickly, assuming they fix this problem. What a huge waste of time, energy, and money as of this moment.			",43,7,0,12,4,0,8

												Played this game for more then 30 hours and enjoyed some parts of it. However, I would not recommend it because it kinda felt like I was playing an easy tutorial for more then half of the time. This game does not ask much of your strategic insights, nor does it involve any creative thinking what so ever. Conclusion is: This game is not worth the time playing, no matter how good it looks and works.			",93,23,0,14,12,0,12

												10/10 If you don't have this game/played it yet, you need to buy it right now. PVZ is a tower defense style game. Every portion of this is entertaining and lovable. The silly humor, addictive gameplay, and brilliant music will charm anyone. This game's soundtrack is incredible. If you play mission 1-10 and your heart isn't pounding from the adrenaline-stirring track, you friend, have no taste in music. While the main story is shallow and way too easy, the challenge modes make up for it and for $10, you'll feel like you're robbing PopCap Games, Inc.			",93,5,0,12,3,0,7

												I ran into a new player whom has never played any installment of the Arma series.I preceeded to teach him how to play for a rough 50 minutes. Soon, he was getting the hang of things. I jokingly put handcuffs on him and forgot we had no keys. I told him to struggle, but avast no success.Eventually, this 5 minute joke turned into an hour hunt scounging around a town for a hacksaw to free him, defending him from zombies and the elements. I fed him, gave him drinks and comforted him. In the end, he was never mad at me. He had complete fun with the hilarity of the situation.As our supplies ran low, I told him the bad news once we had hit the last building in town. He too had realized we were at the end. He got on his knees and I asked him what was on his mind. We both knew what was going to happen at this moment. I legitimately felt sadness and cried as I trained my gun against his back head. The sun setting in the distance. I told him that one of us will have to walk this earth for eternity, and that I should be the one to suffer the curse. Instantly I felt nothing more then the cold air against my back neck as the echos of my gun filled the town. Zombies began to run towards me as I held out in an abandoned apartment building at the top hill of town. I made sure to spare no zombie, nor myself.I still walk this earth as we speak. Making sure to leave cans of beans and cola at every apartment building I pass. A tribute, and an offering to my shortly lived friend. Rest in piece Ryan (3). 7/10 I kept finding blue beanies.

												What is there to say that already hasn't been said?The game is amazing and offers a ton of replay value despite each stage being almost identical. Once you figure out the format for victory it is almost assured if you don't mess up, and even then, the game is pretty forgiving.The hardest part in the game are the mini-games and puzzels with adventure mode being mostly just a tutorial in how to play the other two modes.But you know what? ♥♥♥♥ this game and ♥♥♥♥ PopCap for turning into money hungry ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. This is one of those games that could have had amazing sequel after amazing sequel for all platforms, but instead they opted to sell out to EA and release a micro-transaction nightmare of a sequel for mobile devices. This is what we get when people sell out. A great first product with hope for something more, then a big fat ""♥♥♥♥ YOU"" to the fans, with nothing but♥♥♥♥♥♥afterwords.			",59,11,0,18,8,1,11

												Great game, bad version (yeah, being 'Game of the Year Edition' means nothing).PvZ is a great tower defense game, it's so popular that's available virtually everywhere. Sadly the Steam version (or any other PC version distributed through any service) is the worst of all: it's not optimized, lacks widescreen support, runs at the low-resolution of 800x600 and it can't be changed, Steam overlay not working, etc.I've played the hell out of this game in other systems, I like this game a lot but the Steam version is not what it should be. If you want to play Plants vs. Zombies get it on any other system, just forget about this lousy effort.			",320,74,10,19,21,5,38

												This is a pretty decent game overall and if you love defense games then you will like this. However the game's campaign is way too easy and there should be difficulty options to choose from and the pc version is no where near as good as the console's.But if you have a ps3 or xbox 360, definetely get the game on the console instead of the pc because it has a 2 player coop option unlike the pc, it has a multiplayer mode so you can battle another player and the resolution is alot higher on the consoles unlike the pc where i believe it is locked at 800x600. Also this game does not support 16:9 widescreen which should be a standard which is why i don't reccomend it.			",57,2,2,2,1,0,1

												PvZ is a good game in and of itself.  This in particular is a crummy port of it.  The game is locked into a 4:3 aspect ratio at low resolution (800x600?); the only way to get a widescreen image is to disable hardware acceleration, which results in a stretched image (when it works at all - even this doesn't work for me).  There is zero controller support.  Better versions exist for modern consoles, there is absolutely no excuse for those not being ported over to PC.			",88,32,2,13,1,1,8

												The red thumbs down only means I don't recommend the game, as it is right now. Pros:-Core gameplay is good. Simple and fun.-Nice graphics/aesthetics. Very No Mans Sky esque-Seamless multiplayer (but only with steam friends)-low priceCons:-Not enough content. You can literally do everything in the game within the first 5-6 hours. 90 min with a friend, as in my case. When I say everything I really mean EVERYTHING (queue Gary Oldman in Leon). There's nothing to do after that and restarting to build another base isn't that enticing because there isn't much randomness or world diversity.-Flying is on rails. not real piloting. There's no reason to leave the planet anyway cause they are all the same.-Horrible menus. The menus look just thrown in there by a modder. -Bugs. Low FPS even with very simple graphics. 1440p resolution will revert back to 1600x900 sometimes randomly. FPS will stay at 60 fps solid but will dip often.These can be explained away by being Early Access, but this is really SUPER pre-Alpha. I actually plan on coming back to this later and rebuying when there's more stuff (it has a solid base) but this is nothing more than a demo, and it's a very bare bones demo at that. But if you want to spend 20$ and spend like 3 hours with friends, I think you will get your money's worth.			",40,7,0,5,3,1,5

The controls are lacking, simple thing like drag 'n drop would make it smoother instead of having to click on everything... Quick keys to select the plants would be helpful... hover over the sun rather then clicking --- this is suppose to be GOTY edition... I think not.			",197,77,5,11,28,0,36

												Well I do really enjoy plants vs zombies a lot. Its one of my favorite games of all time. The main reason why I'm giving it a thumbs for me at least is because of the recent errors and unplayability of this game. For me and what I've searched though many people are having the same issue where they can't launch the game because of errors. While many people claim to have fixed the issue I on the otherhand have not been able to play this game. I don't warn people away from purchasing this game i advise you not to purchase this as it is unplayable and you would wind up buying a game thats unplayable. Again I'm not saying it's a bad game Im saying that because in it's current state it cannot be played so just be advise that when you get you will just be gettng an error.			",96,21,0,6,9,2,2

												This is absolutely terrible. I feel genuinely bad for giving somebody money for this. I’ve seen bad PC ports in my day, but this takes the cake so abruptly that I could only play the game for 3 minutes before quitting.Reasons for terrible: fixed low resolution (800x600, are you freaking kidding?!), fixed aspect ratio (THIS GAME WAS MADE FOR 16:9 PHONES, WHY IS THERE 4:3 BLACK BARS?!), horrible framerate (this is a game designed for phones 3 generations old and my GTX 970 cant render it higher than 20 fps), I thought the “3D Acceleration” was put in as an April Fool’s joke (nope), DRM in addition to Steam (don’t bother looking on the store page, they don’t mention this 3rd party DRM like normal publishers do…they have checksums built into the game that prevent ANY kind of modification of key files, so good luck trying to mod it to run normally), inaccurate click-boxes (good luck trying to click the little suns you have to continuously collect mobile-like).Buy this on your phone, or better yet download it and run it on an Android emulator like Andy. This is a great game, I’ve played it many times on my mobile. But this…this is a pathetic excuse of a port. So bad, I’m hesitant to even call it a port for fear of putting it in the same group as Sonic Adventures DX…FREAKING SONIC ADVENTURES DX IS A BETTER PC PORT! *puke*EDIT: Since so many people are downvoting this review, Im assuming theyre doing so because I said its a bad PC port. I should point out that I was incorrect; this is not a PC port, since the game was originally designed for the PC. Regardless, its still a terrible version of the game; ALL of my points (including that terrible PC ports like Sonic Adventures DX put this to shame) still stand. OK? So now you have no justification for downvoting, right? No ""good"" justification anyway...			",416,113,6,48,72,4,78

												It's a great game. But it is a bad made PC port. Graphics look blurred. Resolution settings are not available and looks like 4:3. Basic keyboard like Esc are not supported. Other then that, it's fun to play.I have purchased it when it was reduced (halloween sale). My recommendation: play it on an iPad and not on the PC.			",81,20,6,10,22,0,27

												There is no better or more joyful exhibit of the tower defense genre. The campaign does an excellent job of educating players whilst providing plenty of replay value for more seasoned players. The only downside to the PC version is the complete lack of ongoing developer support, whilst the mobile and console versions continue to get sizable updates and multiplayer. Nevertheless, it's still a classic that'll have your synapses friring on all cylinders and your endorphins popping like candy. 9/10			",782,282,37,128,114,9,168

A simple tower defense game where you use weaponized plants to prevent zombies from eating your brains. Each new level is challenging but never overwhelming.

												Plants vs. Zombies Game Of The Year Edition (PvZ) is a tower defense game that appeals to casual players as well as hardcore RTS enthusiasts.  You protect your home backyard and roof from a zombie infestation with a garden you plant on the fly on a 2D, 5 row landscape.  You are given a plethora of tools to help you fight back the slow moving invaders, but you can only select a limited number of weapons you can take in to each battle.  The tools you have at your disposal include resource generators, shooters/lobbers, bombs, and walls, each having advantages and disadvantages.  The zombies aren't just limited to the slow moving walkers, but rather get wildly creative, and force you to adapt to all of the different tools you have available.  No single tool is over powered.  That is where the game has the greatest strength, earning the GOTY award.  The overall balance is so well done, that the replay value is incredibly high.  Beating the game on normal (which is pretty easy) unlocks the hard mode.  Hard mode is still not too hard, but the hardest mode is within the game is Endless Survival, where the waves don't stop coming.  Casual gamers will appreciate the challenge of hard mode, but the real die hard RTS will find the real gem of Endless Survival, where you can prove your skills through endurance.  The highest my friend has ever achieved is 107 waves, which is a bit harder than it sounds.In short, if you were ever curious about how tower defense games work, you should check it out.  If you are an avid die hard rts fan, you owe it to yourself to check this one out.  What I'm saying is, check it out.			",740,459,28,137,106,8,126

												Fun and simplistic ""tower defense""-like game. Zombies want your brains, you use plants to fend them off. Pretty cut and dry. As you play you gain new plants to use as defense and also have new modes and minigames unlocked. Its available on multiple systems so honestly, it may be better to get this game on your cellphone or something (unless steam has a great sale).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Thats the problem. ITS FUN! Thats what the game is. But it's not WORTH TO BUY! Its not really GOTY, cause its the same thing as the Nintendo DS. If you made the cost less, than it would be good. Well, it IS good, just too pricy. I like it because it was awesome to me, and when i was a little kid i loved this game. Thanks =D ",36,6,0,4,8,0,5

												Most of the hours I played this game was actually my sister and not me. She really loved it and I do too. It takes quite a while to get through the whole stroy mode though, I still didn't quite finish it after about 12 hours. In the beginning it's really easy and fun and then it starts getting harder and harder and you kind of start to panic halfway through a level. It's still fun though. I bought it at full price and it was totally worth it.8/10			",147,41,3,16,14,0,12

												A game you can pick up and play in minutes, useful for the odd few moments when you're unsure of what to play or have 5 mins and don't want to get stuck into something bigger. Plants Vs Zombies is a gun twist on a tower defense game and features you literally growing plants on your lawn, swimming pool and rooftop to stop the zombies from eating your brains.The game is quite replayable, the first run through has several stages and keeps the gameplay interesting by adding hazards such as fog, mini-games like bowling & slots and even some puzzle modes to keep all audiences interested. 2x play throughs of the adventure mode are required to see everything and you can replay the mini games & puzzles at will once they're unlocked.For the score setters, the game features survival modes & even an endless mode just to see how many waves you can last.There's also a ""Zen Garden"" where you grow plants without figting zombies and can have several gardens and a tree of wisdom, providing tips and codes to modify the games visuals.The game looks a little dated due to the developers sticking with a 4:3 resolution and maximised on a 1920 x 1080 screen this can look a little pixelated - that doesn't impact the gameplay and even adds some charm to the game itself.If you're looking for a casual game that will keep you interested over a long period of time and isn't overly difficult in the process, pick this up.

This was a treat of a game as are most of PopCap games, especially the cute little minigames such as WallNut bowling (Not a typo) and Vase Breaker.It was a thorough enjoyment and the only things I found wrong with the game are unmentioned as that would just be nit-picking for my amaetur career as a reviewer. But now the time has come, now I review all the♥♥♥♥♥♥ that has stenched this game for a long time, long past this age old review.EA YOU BAG OF ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. This game was fine!

The shere mass of minigames, puzzels and achievements makes this an enduring game with a lot, I mean seriously a lot, of playtime in it, easily more than a hundred hours if you want to. Or, as I said, you can just play it a short time once in a while to relax and it will still be great. You should really explore this game, including the ""help"" menu :), it's very original and funny. Also amazingly, this is easy to go to and still have very hard levels especially in the minigames, making it popular both among kinder-garden children and people like me at the university. Truly an unique game that will undoubtedly go into video game history and become one of the great classics!			",643,175,23,89,67,5,148

												Before I was given this game as a gift I never really considered playing Plants vs. Zombies. It seemed like a fun casual game, but I thought I wouldn't really get into it. I was dead wrong. I absolutely love it. It's equal parts a fun, simple, casual game and a strategy tower-defense game that requires more thinking as you get farther into the game. I highly recommend it.			",152,62,6,37,17,5,19

												Plants vs. Zombies... a strange idea but awesomely implemented. This is a gamer's zen garden.  Sit back and just enjoy and simple yet fun ""tower defense"" type game. The different types of plants and zombies are both challenging and witty. Though this turf war can get hectic at times, you won't find it draining too much of your grey matter anytime soon.

												I orginally read the title of this game as 'Pants Vs Zombies'. I thought this was a cunning reference to 'Half Life: Full Life Consequences', and anticipated a canon story, leading on from where John Freeman and his brother left off.Unfortunatley, I was instead left with a game that had no mention of such a story, and instead left me playing botanist, sucking 13 hours out of me while I SAT THERE AND PLAYED IT HAVING LOTS OF FUN. Would I recommend this to a friend? Yes.Just remember; it's about plants, not pants. PLANTS.			",72,10,1,2,6,1,9

												I've always loved tower defence gaming.But, I've never really been a fan of the grid-style tower defence limitations.Until PvZ. The cute graphics and diverse content of this game makes it a must for any TD lovers, even those of us that have avoided the grid-based variants in the past.If theres a zombie on your lawn, you NEED to gatling-pea it and ALL of its friends back to zombie hell or you've not experienced the true joy of modern TD gaming.

												Absolutely love this game!  The humour is excellent; witty and engaging.  Appeals to all ages from my youngest to me.  I would recommend this to anyone who fancies a challenge that doesn't demand all your time.The crux is simple: defend your home from the invading hordes of zombies who appear in some bizarre outfits to eat your brains.  Using what can only be considered a variety of genetically modified horticultural weapons, you grow your last lines of defence and battle wave after wave of zombies.This is an immensely satisfying game that will brighten any gloomy afternoon with its challenge and humour.Buy it.
