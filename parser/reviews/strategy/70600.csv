												Worms 3D + Worms 4 Mayhem together, with remastered graphics? Awesome!All is good, good except the lack of effort put into it.I almost feel like they were doing something good but quit half-way because deadlines or something, they didn't even do much follow up after release besides patching game-breaking bugs that didn't allow people to play at all. If I'm recalling correctly the beta correctly, they were trying to put the teleporter utility back in, but ended up not for who knows what reason (although I never got to play it at that time personally due to game launching bugs, so I watched someone else also in the beta who could).Secondly, the lack of Wompot in unraked matches despite still being workable with no bugs (tested with cheat engine), and not being able to choose your team color online is rather disapointing. What's your beef T17? You are doing no one any favours by gradually removing features every game, you actually discontented customers. I can garentee my play time would be almost double it is now if wormpot wasn't removed from unranked matches where you play with friends.Speaking of lack of effort, want to know something about one of the DLC maps? It litterally looks like it was generated with the in-game map editor, but they added in a few insignificant objects to it to make it qualify as a DLC. Gross.What's with Team 17 and bombing their remasters? First this, now Worms World Party.I can't really recommend or not recommend this game over the older games. This is a 2 in 1 game with enhanced looks (and voice acting for W4M story), and has a huge imporvement on physics and camera movement over the original W3D (though, it is practically the same with W4M), but due to the removal of some core features it really gets brought down (I can't even play a modded game without a modded .exe now).

												I was 3D Worms fan as a kid. Is this game is a childhood ruined or exchanced? I'm on the fence.This game is more or less an expanded version of old Worms 4: Mayhem. Most notable changes are graphical upgrades and Worms 3D singleplayer campain available to beat. Those are fine additions and the core gameplay is still okay, but there are noticable problems.Overall art still is a cartoony but normal-looking 3D graphics clash with poor cel-shaded explosion effects - this combination just don't work. Old Worms 3D effects where more eye inviting. Music is completely horrible. Worms 3D (game) and Armagedonn had a distinctive styles: happy-party and grim-doomy respectively. This game is just bland with uninspiring music and no art direction.Game is slower paced than a 2D worms, which is not a bad thing on it's own. However, overall experience isn't what fun, thanks to the sluggish weapon and utilities physics. Weapons behave very strangely. Some are extremely reliable (constant 50DMG Bazooka shots) or suprisingly unreliable (Banana Bomb). On top of that, AI is still stupid as a Sheep. Team 17 never programmed a fine artificial enemies.Worms 4 singleplayer missions are uninspired. they are paired with pretty bland story around them. The included Worms 3D missions are more interesting. They are compact, focused and not bounded in half-baked story arcs.Menus ergonomy and UI needs a complete rework. Hidden important options, difficult navigation, poor visuals.This game is somethat a fun experience, but you need other people with the same preference to the 3D Worms games as you. With friends, you will have a blast, thanks to the better controls and hilarity of events. You don't have such people around you? Make a pass. You had enough of Worms in 3D (no matter, if in the good or bad way)? Make a pass. I'm still giving this game a Upvote, but it is a close one. I feel really generous today or maybe I feel nostalgic to those original Worms 3D missions?			",168,39,11,6,6,2,16

												For the record my favorite Worms game of all time is Worms Armageddon. The art style, the game play, weapons, level editor, and game layout (options, theme, layout of menus) were all done right. This is when games were made to be bought once, and to be bought as a whole.I saw Worms Ultimate Mayhem as a recommended game instead of Armageddon. The first thing that caught my eye was that this game was the 3D version of what I loved so much. I figured for the on sale price, I'll give it a shot. I can tell you that I am not at all disappointed with my purchase (except that Worms is still a turn based game! I wish they would make a real time one - how? Well I'm not getting paid to make or suggest games). Seeing worms in 3D is phenomenal, and the art and them style they chose to go along with the game just fits it perfectly. The game play is just as good as ever, however will take some time to adjust and get used to the new range/power system. I didn't know a worm could throw a grenade three football fields away from the map. Lesson learned.Game play itself can be seen from first person or third person worm view. Weapons are varied as usual and are cool to use and shoot. The explosive or corrosive materials found around the map can also be used to eliminate your opponent. Does the 3D land disappear after you blow it up? Damn right it does. How are the camera angles? Actually quite consistent when using weapons, can be a bit confusing or frustrating when simply observing the map. I find that even with unchecking the inverse box for camera angles sometimes it turns itself back on. This is usually fixed by simply squaring the screen with the worm again. That's essentially the only complaint I have is the camera controls.This game does have CONTROLLER SUPPORT - which is greatly appreciated.This deserves an 8.1/10 as worms in 3D with the game play and art style they chose, I'd have to give it a .1 over than my solid 8 average. It is a fun game - and can keep you busy for a while with the story, challenges, or just a quick match.For future Mayhem games (or 3D worm games), maybe try getting rid of the turn based system, or play around with allowing more first person type of play. Do something XCOM : enemy unknown would do (wait, take cover and fire at the enemy when in range) with worms the player isn't using. Also, please try to improve the camera controls!(I did get this game on sale :)RATING : 7.5/10 Gameplay B- Story / Campaign B+ Visuals / User Interface B Sounds / Music B- Replay-ability B Overall  B- ScreenShots :  The worm customizations properties are original and awesome.

												Join the Hype once more! We're talking about a Worms game that belongs in Team17 Studios' 3D series, which I personally love! (Oh boy! I can't forget how many hours I've spent with Worms 4: Mayhem). The game's mechanics are pretty simple, meaning that you can Move/Scope/Shoot easily. The use of a Joypad is highly reccomended since it makes it a lot easier for you to play this specific game. Well, the game's Single Player storyline is smooth and very funny, but what is more exciting and fun to play is its Multiplayer! Moreover you have the option to customize and to create your own Weapons and of course the Worm's Outfits and Style, which I find really good and interesting if I may say. Furthermore the game's goal is simple and that is what makes it ""easy"" as I mentioned before. Obliterate the enemy team!.To sum up its a valid game to play if you want to relax and have some fun, especially if you have your friends with. Finally I have to mention that there are many 2D Worms releases that are also good and viable (For Example: Worms: Reloaded).I give this game 8/10 ",62,4,0,7,2,1,4

												The two 3D Worms titles (Worms 3D and Worms 4: Mayhem) packaged together in a collector's edition of sorts, which comes with many small improvements (mostly graphical). The 3D entries are typically held to be the weakest in the series, but I think they have been unjustly treated by most players. The game as a whole seems to lack the elegance (it does take quite a bit longer to learn the basics) of the 2D titles, and there's not much that can be done about that - It has less of that ""pick up and play"" quality of the other Worms games.If you do get over the initial bump, you'll discover a rather charming turn based artillery game. All of the classic tactical considerations return in 3D (try having your bazooka shot be influenced by 3D wind!), and many new ones are introduced. Most of the old weapon and equipment dynamics remain, though to different degrees of fidelity and with an eye on enabling the new gameplay. Even terrain destruction is back, though the granularity of their weird ""poxel"" technology can often appear low (i.e. terrain and objects are composed of only a few large ""chunks""), and the environmental damage always occurs in a distinctly ""blocky"" fashion.It feels like a console port through and through (you cannot even select weapons with hotkeys - a staple of PC Worms), and the UI is rather garish. The game can be a bit unstable, and crashes when you minimize/maximize the game window are not unheard of.Even if it didn't have a solid and enjoyable MP mode (if lacking in customization options), I would still recommend this game solely for its campaign. Worms 3D and Worms 4: Mayhem have by far the best SP missions of any Worms game, and they're all available in Ultimate Mayhem. A lot of variety and creativity on display, and it can be rather challenging to beat the par time on some of them. It really does seem like the SP was Team 17's main focus for the 3D games, which makes them even more unusual.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Worms Ultimate Mayhem is one of those party game Gems that only comes around when you least expect it. Built on the foundations of Worms 3D, the game adds new maps, weapons and items that allow the player to completely customise every aspect of the game. Like many similar party games, worms has always been about its multiplayer, and this game is no exception. The game is great fun on your own and even better when playing with your friends on steam. Great fun to be had and Holy Hand Grenades to be thrown!The only slighlty negative point of this game is the awful camera which is as buggy and unresponsive as the one in Worms 3D.

												If the 3D branch of the Worms series didn't irk you, then you will find this really is the ultimate edition. It has the Worms 3D campaign as well as a new one, and tons of other new features. My Xbox One controller is working quite well, although the game didnt tell me what buttons did what. You do need a mouse or keyboard to skip the launcher.It's definitely a charming game. I really think it could have benefitted from a little cel-shading but otherwise, it runs great, and the destructable environments make things very dynamic. Of course, most fans feel like the move to 3D made the game too unreliable to play and I tend to agree, but I'm still enjoying it. It's just a very different game. You'll find arching lobbed grenades way harder, but direct line of sight attacks are much easier to hit. And it also gives you an indicator for when melee attacks will make contact, so you won't goof them up.Good game here. I'll keep returning to it, but it wont replace the 2D Worms experience. It's a supplement.			",501,122,11,54,26,6,76

												Worms Ultimate Mayhem is generally what people consider to be the best game in the series when they don't think armageddon, wwp or w2 are. And rightfully so, the prebuilt maps are a blast, and on this version of the game, the list of them is huge. I also like how the customisation here is much more depth than in any other game in the series. Name me one other game in the series that allows you to change your hands! (don't say worms 4 mayhem). Team weapons, flags, etc. I also enjoyed the campaign, lots of light-hearted humour and originality. One mission you're destroying wind machines in order to lure out a wizard, then you're escaping from a flooding dam that was blown up by the enemy, and taking care of them. You also have to protect the Professor in some missions too! Brilliant! I haven't got to play online much, but it doesn't seem very good. Sorry guys; you know what I'm going to say, online is a ghost town.But the single player kicks so much♥♥♥♥♥that it makes up for this.Btw guys, I found the speech bank that fits with the speech of your worms in the story mode cutscenes; it's 'Asbo Boi'. He's a dlc voice though, in the customisation pack.Score: 9.1/10			",7,0,1,0,0,1,7

												One of the funnest multiplayer games to play with your friends ever!!! Its good for over the internet or in your own home.

												I bought this game a while ago, when it was on sale. Loved Worms 3D, so I thought it would be worth a try. And it was! The game is very similar to 3D, except for the costomization options for your worms. Also the coin and store system has been integrated, there are even some weapons to buy for coins that you earn for mastering challenges. And the best thing: they included the Worms 3D story so even after you finished the normal story it won't get boring playing in single-player. Although I did not dare to try the competetive mode, I would recommend this game to everyone who played Worms 3D.But get it for sale!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Worms. On the one day you choose to be the first worm, on another day you choose to be the second worm. You make use of the second amendment, you arm yourself with what is your very human right and you go out and fight for what you believe in: Liberty, Freedom of Speech, Sanctity of Jesus Christ and Federalism.Worms is a tactical RTS strategy war simulation shooter where you take up arms with your worms and shoot onto other worms. You, the player, switch between what worms you play, arm everyone individually and go out to defend what you believe in by crushing your foes using your immense fire power.This game is another symbolism of what is going on in the real world. A cry for help by the brave developers to the players, the citizens of the world and defend what is good and holy. First of all, this game actively supports the right of a healthy minded citizen to bear arms. You get to see the actual destruction, the crushing power of your arms against those who want to take away your freedom, those who want to remove what you believe in by replacing it with something sinister and dark.Do you, dear reader, believe in freedom of speech, in the right to exercise any kind of religion without having the state interfering with your affairs? Then this game is for you. You will go out, arm your worm and actively defend your rights. The developer promises that for every shot fired in this game, a real shot against a globalist is done which means that with every worm you kill in this game, we make a step further in winning this war against the world government, against dictatorship and people trying to take away your rights. You might ask yourself ""Why should I play this game to do something that I do not feel the consequences for?"" The answer is simple: America. You fight for it, no matter where you live and what you do, all the time, everywhere, always, anywhere. This game brings this right, this sacred ability to protect what you think is necessary and important to whole new level and this is exactly what we need.Do not believe the mainstream media. I am just asking questions, why aren't you? This game is a gem in a massive pile of dirt, you need to acquire, you need to play, you need to study it. Be the resistance, be the voice of freedom, be the winner of the infowar.God bless America.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you're going to get a Worms game. Get this one. Play with some friends and they will be enemies in no time. The 3D gameplay is what really differs from other Worms games. Somewhat confusing controls but it won't matter when you have a the Pope flying towards your head. And you can fling cows, which is a great use of farm animals!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I think this is the worms game that i am spending the most time online with my friend logan! We have a blast on his custom game type and i suggest you get this game instead of 4 mayhem or well mabaye 3D i think as a combination of the 2 i think it makes a slight better experience than 4 mayhem and worms 3D. The single player is the same as the 2 games espically 4 mayhem but for 4 mayhem's story and cutscenes they added voices and i think they're funny and cute XD! the multiplayer is good at best but u cant use wormpot online...uh WTF?! that would've been an amazing choice to make lots of different things to do online! and u can save random landscapes...thats nice but i still would justs probally pick one of the other landscapes. Anyways this game is awesome for a 3D game lots of armageddon fans will be like WHATS WITH THE PHYSICS?! OMG THIS SUKS SO BAD I LOVE ARMEGDDON ENFEGABA. well i dont care u armageddon fans go back and play ur competive style this.. is fun. anyways i give this game a 9/10 its very good but not perfect. and i highly recommened it!

There are some issues with the camera and a few bugs but if you love the cute Worms you will love Ultimate Mayhem. It's not a Strategy Game like the 2D Games, more a Arcade - Fun Game but I can't stop playing it.. :) Feel free to add me if you want to play a round and Team 17, pls add Trading Cards and the Steam Workshop.

												Some people say that the 3D Worms games are the worst in the series. But, personally, I enjoyed this game.It's basically a remaster of Worms 3D and Worms 4 Mayhem. Both campaigns are present, the same thing is with maps.  All customization was taken from W4M. Basically all content was taken from the previous 3D games (Except for Worms Forts Under Siege, people have forgotten about that one). Anyways, it provided great fun for me and I recommend you to buy it.			",44,21,6,5,13,0,4

The key feature in my opinion is the customization. You can create a team of 6 worms and name them whatever you want and dress them to your liking. You can also create your own weapon and match type. Play alone or with friends and your in for a blast! Highly recommend this game!*Controller compatability is a bit wonky. Easier just to use keyboard and mouse			",58,5,0,10,6,0,19

												Worms has always held a very strong position in my opinion. It wears it's heart on it's sleeve: It isn't an A-List game and it isn't for everyone. But for me, it's one of the most passionately developed game series ever.Things have certainly moved on since the side-scrolling invertibrate slaughter-fest of the first games to the 3D variants of the game. And whilst I did love the 2D games, I have to admit that I prefer the 3D versions. Ultimate mayhem combines the best bits of two great titles: Worms 3D and Worms 3: Mayhem, keeping all the best bits from both and removing the bad. The customisation is absolutely fantastic: Worms with Pope hats and 3D glasses shooting bazookas at Worms with Bunny ears and disco glasses has to be one of the most hilarious things in gaming.As I said before, it's turn-based nature and sometimes fairly difficult missions are not for everyone. But if the thought of carnage, explosions, flying sheep bombs, alien abductions, an endless array of hats and voices, air-strikes and a huge concrete donkey even makes you smile, then perhaps you should give this game a look.You won't regret it.

												I have to say honestly after 5 - 6 years of waiting for an installment of a new 3D game of the Worm series, this is definatly a must-get if you're looking for an upgrade from Worms 3D and Mayhem 4 Mayhem as Team 17 succesfully put them toghther in one soup mix.  Though this 3D title may bring a little dissapointment to those who were looking for something revolutionary.Although it was very nice having a refreshing HD makeover, camera upgrade and fixes, and with a new level editor, and perhaps some other small changes I haven't notice, it doesn't seem apparent that Team17's heart was into this one.  This is where unfotunatly I can't give them much credit.  Even Worms Reloaded felt more more revolutionary than this even if it was supposedly a remake of Worms Armaggedon.  Which, actually, what essientially Worms Ultimate Mayhem is.  A remake, which otherwise I would call this title Worms 4 Mayhem Reloaded.Regardless, I still recomend this any fan of the 3D series if they're looking for something a bit fresh after several years with Worms 4 Mayhem.  It's also perfect if you're someone who's looking to pick up Worms 4 Mayhem again and also an affordable price.  If you're looking for something that's really revolutionary and fresh in the Worms series, you're better off going with Worms Revolution.  No pun intented.			",48,22,3,9,17,2,16

												A complete remake of Worms 3D and Worms 4: Mayhem with better camera controls, easier movement, and an easy to access menu.Throw that with better terrain, hats, the holy hand grenade and other Worms-exclusive stuffs and we get a very good 3D Worms game.Granted, 3D and 4 was decent in their own rights but they had problems, sometimes their camera would be faulty, making it difficult to see behind things. The terrain can be quite buggy too, if I recall. But Ultimate Mayhem seems to be setting out to right these problems, in mostly the right ways.The game feels smooth, runs smoothly and generally plays smoothly as well, the only gripe that I have with it is the Jetpack, it just feels kind of odd and it controls like a llama driving a car, very slowly when turning to the sides, very quickly when going forward.But nonetheless, the game seems to have patched up most of its flaws nicely, and I applaud this.Also, you can create secret weapons for your worms.

												A bit of a underrated gem, Worms Ultimate Mayhem came in and out of the spotlight rather quietly. It merged together ""Worms 3D"" and ""Worms 4 Mayhem"", two games previously released in 2004 and 2005 (Respectively). All though the game is the same old story, the whole thing still feels fresh as when it first cames out. While the game can tend to grow fairly tedious when played by one person, if you huddle up a couple friends around the computer and break out the snacks you're bound to have a good time.Much like its predecessors, the game takes on a humourous combat style type game on unique little landscapes. Using comedic weapons that'd you expect to see in a cartoon, you battle your way to defeat all the opposing worms. It's mindless, but at the same time fun. The game can be fairly difficult in some of the challenges, but it feels just right.My only real complaint with the game is the lack of being able to easily create / import other maps. All this game needs is a level editor and perhaps a few more character creation options and it would be amazing. None the less, a truly great game.			",9,1,1,3,3,0,3

												Worms has always held a very strong position in my opinion. It wears it's heart on it's sleeve: It isn't an A-List game and it isn't for everyone. But for me, it's one of the most passionately developed game series ever.Things have certainly moved on since the side-scrolling invertibrate slaughter-fest of the first games to the 3D variants of the game. And whilst I did love the 2D games, I have to admit that I prefer the 3D versions. Ultimate mayhem combines the best bits of two great titles: Worms 3D and Worms 3: Mayhem, keeping all the best bits from both and removing the bad. The customisation is absolutely fantastic: Worms with Pope hats and 3D glasses shooting bazookas at Worms with Bunny ears and disco glasses has to be one of the most hilarious things in gaming.As I said before, it's turn-based nature and sometimes fairly difficult missions are not for everyone. But if the thought of carnage, explosions, flying sheep bombs, alien abductions, an endless array of hats and voices, air-strikes and a huge concrete donkey even makes you smile, then perhaps you should give this game a look.You won't regret it.

												I have to say honestly after 5 - 6 years of waiting for an installment of a new 3D game of the Worm series, this is definatly a must-get if you're looking for an upgrade from Worms 3D and Mayhem 4 Mayhem as Team 17 succesfully put them toghther in one soup mix.  Though this 3D title may bring a little dissapointment to those who were looking for something revolutionary.Although it was very nice having a refreshing HD makeover, camera upgrade and fixes, and with a new level editor, and perhaps some other small changes I haven't notice, it doesn't seem apparent that Team17's heart was into this one.  This is where unfotunatly I can't give them much credit.  Even Worms Reloaded felt more more revolutionary than this even if it was supposedly a remake of Worms Armaggedon.  Which, actually, what essientially Worms Ultimate Mayhem is.  A remake, which otherwise I would call this title Worms 4 Mayhem Reloaded.Regardless, I still recomend this any fan of the 3D series if they're looking for something a bit fresh after several years with Worms 4 Mayhem.  It's also perfect if you're someone who's looking to pick up Worms 4 Mayhem again and also an affordable price.  If you're looking for something that's really revolutionary and fresh in the Worms series, you're better off going with Worms Revolution.  No pun intented.			",48,22,3,9,17,2,16

												A complete remake of Worms 3D and Worms 4: Mayhem with better camera controls, easier movement, and an easy to access menu.Throw that with better terrain, hats, the holy hand grenade and other Worms-exclusive stuffs and we get a very good 3D Worms game.Granted, 3D and 4 was decent in their own rights but they had problems, sometimes their camera would be faulty, making it difficult to see behind things. The terrain can be quite buggy too, if I recall. But Ultimate Mayhem seems to be setting out to right these problems, in mostly the right ways.The game feels smooth, runs smoothly and generally plays smoothly as well, the only gripe that I have with it is the Jetpack, it just feels kind of odd and it controls like a llama driving a car, very slowly when turning to the sides, very quickly when going forward.But nonetheless, the game seems to have patched up most of its flaws nicely, and I applaud this.Also, you can create secret weapons for your worms.

The land is destructible, the explosions are large, and the new Create-a-Weapon feature tos it off. If you can get past the bugginess of this title, it's a fun refreshing of old Worms fun.

												Unlike most of the previous 2D Worms games, Worms Ultimate Mayhem features a 3D, turn-based artillery strategy that allows player to move freely rather from left and right. In the game lobby, players are able to choose from a wide variety of different weapons and use them when the game starts. At the start of the game each player is able to control four worms, due to the game turned-base nature, each player control one worm at a time with a set time limit; when the time limit expires or when the worm fires a weapon, the player's turn will end and the opponent will start his turn. The objective of the game is to eliminate all of the enemy team worms. There are two ways that a worm can be eliminated. The simplest way is to deplete the worm of its health, that can be done by choosing a weapon, aiming it at the enemy worm, and firing at the opposing team worm. The second way is to knock the worm out of the platform; some weapons provide the ability to push or knock back the opposing worm. Once a worm is eliminated, it cannot be brought back to life and once all four of a player's worms are eliminated the game will end. The team with worms left standing is the winner.

Sulking was normal for that age, and even now, I got the game, my friend's got it too and it's a good way to have a laugh and a good game, it's not a game designed to play seriously and you can tell because the environment and community is very relaxed.

												This is taken from a comment I wrote on YouTube a while ago, I'm posting it here as my review. Edited it a little, also.I have the game on the PlayStation 3 too (don't ask why I have it for both the PC and PlayStation 3). To be honest, I prefer Worms 4: Mayhem (I only have it for the PC, pirated copy from 2005/2006). It has better game-play (it's better for battling, Roping, navigating, etc. and don't ask why, hard to explain it), better tweaks (Is it even possible to tweak Worms: Ultimate Mayhem? I have the PC version of the game and I don't know how to tweak it. There are no "".xml"" files.), better music (this is my opinion, the Worms: Ultimate Mayhem music is great too, they're remixes of the old Worms 4: Mayhem tracks, but it really sucks that they took out the old Worms 4: Mayhem Sudden Death theme, they could have made a remix of that), better online play (They removed the Wormpot for online games in Worms: Ultimate Mayhem! How could they do this to us?! And you can't actually pick your own team in Worms: Ultimate Mayhem for online play, it picks one of your teams automatically, and it doesn't display the name of the team at the beginning of your turn, it simply shows your player name instead.), better HUD... They even removed the Icarus Potion Cheat in Worms: Ultimate Mayhem! I have 12 Worms games, including Worms Armageddon (the so-called ""best game in the series"", yes, it may be the best 2D game), and Worms 4: Mayhem was always my favorite, and Worms: Ultimate Mayhem is a very close second (and Worms 3D is third, but not that close). Yes, the new HD graphics for Worms: Ultimate Mayhem are nice, so are the new sound effects and the new ""Credits"" screen (it has humorous cut-scenes), and I like the Binoculars (although I was hoping for all Worms 3D weapons mixed with the Worms 4: Mayhem weapons), the new online features are also nice (such as ""Ranked Match"", but I still prefer the Worms 4: Mayhem online system), and they also added all the Worms 3D maps as well, along with the Worms 3D Campaign, which is very important. But, to be honest, I don't think they'll ever make a game that could top good old Worms 4: Mayhem.As for Worms: Ultimate Mayhem, the PC and PlayStation 3 versions are equally as good. For the PC version, you could change the controls for your keyboard and controller too, which is very important. In the PlayStation 3 version, you can't change the controls for your controller, you can only choose three default sets for all controls on the controller (""Goofy"", ""Classic"", and ""Mayhem""). But for the PlayStation 3 version, there's a larger limit to the amount of characters for weapon and Game Style names, which is also very important. It also has a sufficient amount of characters for team names. For the PC version, it only has a large enough character limit for team names, not weapon or Game Style names. So, as I said, they're both equally as good.﻿But in general, I'd highly recommend this game. It's one of the best I've ever played.			",1,0,0,0,0,0,5

												Maybe not as good and compact as the original Worms 3D, and maybe not as original as the, well, original games and Forts but definitively worth buying if you liked Mayhem or never got a chance to try it out.WARNING: This thing here with W3D and Mayhem is similiar to Melee and Brawl: 3D was more fast-paced and competitive while this Mayhem thing is pure party and shoot 'em up. If you are into more casual play then this is what you probably want, while competitive players will more than likely be disappointed, unless they don't mind disabling a few weapons and utilities.Too bad Binoculars aren't still any use...Anyway, it quite is worth playing, so I recommend it.

All the great things that I loved about Worms in 2D translate very well to the 3rd dimension and they make for a great party game to play with friends! It isn't quite as easy to pick up and play, the learning curve isn't to steep and is absolutely worth getting past.  I'd give Worms Ultimate Mayhem a 7/10.

												Oh yes. This game is... THE MOST LEGENDARY GAME FROM MY CHILDHOOD! I remember playing worms 4 mayhem when I was like 8 years old. And this game is basically the same, just better.Let me point out a few reasons why you should immediately put all of your money into this game:The gameplay: Turn based, 3D gameplay. While it's most fun when played with a controller, it'll be almost as fun with your keyboard and mouse. It's also so much fun with local multiplayer, since A) There's usually no one at the online multiplayer and B) You can't smash online opponents with the controller. Also the story mode is a ton of fun. You get the full story mode of worms 4 mayhem and worms 3d! Also, you'll be fine with a single controller, since you just give the controller to the person who has the turn.The music: OHMYGOSHYES!!!!! The soundtrack is just amazing. I want to describe it with the word: Masterpiece. I downloaded almost the full soundtrack because the music is just so awesome. It's very calm, but fits the game for some reason.Also, you can create your own teams (with hats and stuff), weapons and gamemodes. I absolutely and warmly recommend this game. Now go ahead and buy it.			",109,16,0,2,6,0,2

												Oh yes. This game is... THE MOST LEGENDARY GAME FROM MY CHILDHOOD! I remember playing worms 4 mayhem when I was like 8 years old. And this game is basically the same, just better.Let me point out a few reasons why you should immediately put all of your money into this game:The gameplay: Turn based, 3D gameplay. While it's most fun when played with a controller, it'll be almost as fun with your keyboard and mouse. It's also so much fun with local multiplayer, since A) There's usually no one at the online multiplayer and B) You can't smash online opponents with the controller. Also the story mode is a ton of fun. You get the full story mode of worms 4 mayhem and worms 3d! Also, you'll be fine with a single controller, since you just give the controller to the person who has the turn.The music: OHMYGOSHYES!!!!! The soundtrack is just amazing. I want to describe it with the word: Masterpiece. I downloaded almost the full soundtrack because the music is just so awesome. It's very calm, but fits the game for some reason.Also, you can create your own teams (with hats and stuff), weapons and gamemodes. I absolutely and warmly recommend this game.

												We all know Worms, don't we ? This one was an old school Worms game, in 3D, meaning you had a lot more freedom. One thing they didn't really think through though was the fact that aiming was a whole lot harder (yeah, even harder than in 2D) this time. Matches could take tens of minutes. It was frustrating and didn't work all that well, unfortunately. Other than that, it had all the things that made Worms famous in the first place. Not a bad game, just not without its flaws.[Rating: 70/100]			",1661,635,69,222,194,16,225

												Worms Ultimate Mayhem. That's the name.Conclusion:A good ""turn based artillery strategy"" game, pretty much like all the other Worms games.Pros:Good gameplayNice controls/controllingThree dimensions to play in, instead of the usual twoAn enjoyable amount of weapons (though could of course be more)Very good storymode with even some voice actingCapability of creating custom weaponsCons:Some aesthetic issues (Renaming teams, game rules or weapons is not possible, and neither is the CPU level and PC switching, existing)Inspecting ""pre-built"" game rules, is not possibleCustom weapons don't have a very big lot of customization (Only available types are launched, grenade and airstrike, and only of the custom weapons can be used at a time, and they have to be assigned to a certain team to be used by that teamAside from that, I haven't found any issues Pretty much all of the issues you can find in this game, have been, or, for some reason, were, fixed in Worms Reloaded, or, were not fixed in Worms 4: Mayhem			",30,2,0,0,4,1,6

												I mean, it's Worms, what's not to like about it. Granted the fact that it's 3D is a bummer, and the story arent that good, but once you get over that it's a blast to play against your friends or against some CPUs. 8/10, would recommend.			",31,2,0,1,2,0,4

												We all know Worms, don't we ? This one was an old school Worms game, in 3D, meaning you had a lot more freedom. One thing they didn't really think through though was the fact that aiming was a whole lot harder (yeah, even harder than in 2D) this time. Matches could take tens of minutes. It was frustrating and didn't work all that well, unfortunately. Other than that, it had all the things that made Worms famous in the first place. Not a bad game, just not without its flaws.[Rating: 70/100]			",1661,635,69,222,194,16,225

												--Most of the achievements don't work at all (I got ""All the challenges"" but not ""Complete one challenge"" ?????, Glide like a worm, etc.)--Worms 3d Campaign intro texts can not be skipped in any way and it has no voice acting.++A definite classic, and lots of fun with friendsThe game is ok itself, but there are way too many bugs like the ones stated above.

												Hello people of worms!I would like to inform you that the lobbying system in this game flawed. Who said once you set off a nade you can't put it back together! Another factor is the hitbox on the sniper rifle, I got csgoed so hard. Also why doesn't prodding someone hurt them, comeon atleast put a sadface on them for the emotional scarring they get after getting shoved in the back.Thanks for the listenPhilhone			",48,6,5,10,9,0,4

												I have only played this for a couple of hours but I know enough to get a solid impression. As someone who has played Worms 3D on the Playstation 2 and enjoyed it as a kid... I have to say this is disappointing.Firstly, the things that I enjoyed doing as a kid are all there. That being, the ability to make a few teams, and then a game mode where all the weapons are unlocked with no restrictions. Yes you are able to do this, but it may at first look like there is no way to impliment this in to a CPU game mode, but it turns out ""game mode"" is different to ""game style"" with the style being the mode you have created. It's odd, but at least it is in there. So other than re-creating a bit of childhood fun I used to have when I was 10 years old...this game is pretty useless, and I would say it is unfinished.Firstly, there is not a lot of weapon variety in this game compared to other titles I have played in the Worms franchise (The DS version Armageddon comes to mind) which is a shame. And there is nothing particularly as wacky as the other games. Also, half of the sound effects from Worms 3D are completely GONE. And there is a lot less variety in the voices for your worms. The campaign modes are short as well. It has a new campaign (Which is either new to this game or was in Forts: Under Siege) and the campaign from Worms 3D. The Worms 3D only has SEVEN missions, and the new campaign has FOUR. And with each mission taking about 10-15 minutes to beat, that makes the game about 2-3 hours long. There are challenge modes and an online mode, but the online is dead and the challenge missions are pointless with no reason to play them at all unless you REALLY care about pointless score which you can't compare to anyone because there is either no option for leaderboard (I couldn't find one) or there is and no one is using it because no one is playing this game. Only play this if you played Worms 3D and/or Worms Forts: Under Siege on the PS2, just to get a nostalgia rush. But even then you won't be playing the game for very long. I mean, I've put just under 2 hours in and I don't really want to play this anymore.			",146,8,3,9,22,3,18

Kui olete harjunud, graafika setetega, siis seal neid eriti pole. Mängu alguses saad paika panna Reso, anti-analaising ja siis veel paar asja.*Mäng kui mängSee on lõbus mängida, eriti koos sõpradega. Kui on igav võta lihtsalt mäng lahti ja tunne natuke rõõmu milline absurd mäng see olla võib. Võrreldes eelmiste osadega pole see eriti muutunud ainult graafiliselt natuke.			",142,17,12,13,19,2,19

												I remember receiving this game as a birthday present when I was 9 years old, when it was under the name ""Worms 4 Mayhem"". The game is like I recalled it to be back then: amazing. I recommend you to buy all of the DLC and the game itself, especially when it's on sale. The game is still suprisingly brilliant for a game that was released in 2005 in terms of gameplay, quality and originality. I really can't distinguish any flaws in this game, although it's not the type of game to necessarily play everyday for 5 hours.			",38,1,2,1,4,1,3

												Now you can  make the worst decision in your entire Worms career, IN 3DDDDDDDDDWhat can you do in 3D!?!? YOU CAN• Accidentally jump off high cliffs at the beginning of your turn.• Waste a super weapon and miss your intended target completely• Traverse to the other end of the map just to get a cluster bomb and have your turn end because you took to long to get it.• Mistake your own team for the enemy team.• Name your worms after terrible memes.The possibilities are nearly ENDLESSSSSSS!!!!!!!1!111!!!1!11111!!!

												  Ive given this game some more time and although it might run worse on slower computers it might run fine for most as long as you dont stretch the AA.  Its like the classic Worms style play but in First person, so the new perspective makes it very excitiing. You can customize your worms a little bit along with making your own ""team weapon"" (your team gets only 1).   For those who havn't played worms before you start your match with 4 of them. The objective is to kill your friends 4 worms with rockets, bombs, guns, exploding sheep, or by just knocking them into water. Its awesome fun to play with friends but theres also a  well-made single player story mode. About 30 missions, all voice dialogue.   I give this game a 8/10 for the price theres a lot in here. I give Worms: Reloaded a 4/10 that game lacked any storyline had brocken cpu oppoents, Its falls far behind compared to this ""Gem in the rough"".			",221,44,2,45,23,3,48

												This game is pretty much a remaster of Worms 4 Mayhem, with Worms 3D maps. The devs have pretty much abonded this game. You're on your own when it comes to fixing the quirks this game has. All in all, you're not really missing out if you already own Worms 4  Mayhem. If haven't owned a 3d worms game in the past, then definitely get this one. There are still some people playing online.			",112,9,1,10,9,0,7

												Pro:Cute graphicsSingle, multi & co-op playAchievesFunnyKinda family friendlyCon:Controller suppotSlowRepetitiveOverpricedNo steam cards (yet)Stupid game (read below)Overall:I find it hard to rate this game.  If it took itself seriously, the game would suck and suck hard. However it doesn't and it's very tongue in cheek with silly elements.  Does this make up for being boring after an hour or so? That's your call.  This game really needs a demo so you can see if it's your cup of tea or not.It's not a good strategy game (there are better ones on steam for the same price), it's not a good action game (also better ones on steam) and it's not the best multiplayer - Co-Op game on steam (or even for it's price).  Without the houmor his game would be an easy thumbs down.  If you like this houmor, grab the game .... ideally in a bundle.  If your not into ""Worms"", this probably won' convert you.5/10 -1 no cards -2 price +2 funny +1 graphics +1 often in bundles = 6/10Get it in a bundle and try out one of the cheap ""worms"" games to see if you like the houmor 1st.

It's better, but only slightly, and doesn't add much.			",1107,439,35,132,114,11,221

												This version of Worms is a updated version of Worms 3D and Worms 4 Mayhem. Basically, it's a turn-based strategy, first or third person, team vs team battle of the mind.It features updated graphics and cameras, new sound effects, the entire Worms 3D and Worms 4 campaigns, and a long list of single player deathmatches and challenges.Steam Leaderboards and Achievements are included.For those familiar with the 2D series, you will find familar weapons and tools, but the whole world is now in 3D.This 3D world takes a lot of getting used too and you WILL need to invest some time in learning the controls,but once you get the hang of it you will have a blast.Eventually you may even start ""thinking outside the box"". Example? You COULD move that Oil Drum close to a Worm with your Grapple Hook...Sadly, the online community is seriously lacking and the online connection between opponents could randomly close the game or crash to desktop...I very highly recommend this game to anyone! Add me if you want a regular multiplayer opponent. :)			",32,9,2,25,0,0,10

												It's just not as good in 3D.It really, really isn't.Pro:Customization's pretty good, though for many of these games this is the caseTeam Weapon (Probably the coolest part)A sort of story with narrationNew weaponsChallengesNew grapple hook abilitiesMore gamemode CustomizationCon:The 3D makes it really unenjoyable, you are exposed no matter where you areVery few options when it comes to avoiding damageMovement is very floatyLand mines are hardly a threat since you can walk around them3D maps means water nearby from any point on the map, so you are bound to get into a fight seeing who can knock the enemies worms into the water firstControls are not optimized well for keyboards (you can fix the keybinds but not the mouse controls)Gameplay doesn't feel as well rounded as previous games, some weapons are obviously better than othersTeam weapons are overpowered (Although it's the coolest, these weapons can kill worms very effectively)Randomly Generated maps always have flat open terrain, even premade maps have wide open spaceI don't like this game. play a 2D worms game instead, you will not regret it. This feels less like a strategy game and more like a shooter. (In reality it should be both)			",81,12,0,11,12,1,4

												Fun bit of nostalgia, and the game would be fine overall, if not for the godawful camera. Just read all the other reviews. It's true. It's god awful. The algorithm is terrible. When an explosion occurs, the game focuses on worms that are flying off into the ocean. This is useless. You want to see what happens to the other worms, where they will fall, how much health they have left. But you won't see that, because before the explosion even finishes, the camera pans away to chase the worm that's flying away, which is totally useless information.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As far as I'm concerned, the key draw of Worms games always was how they were simple mad destructive fun, and great as party games. So the emphasis was on ""simple"". In the 3D environment of Worms Ultimate Mayhem, it's fairly tricky to use basic weapons effectively. There's a fairly steep learning curve that takes away the ""simple"".To be fair, it's really not bad in single player, but single player just isn't what I love - and buy - Worms for.

												This game has the potential to be fun, but it is ruined because of its absolutely terrible controls.They are not user friendly, wonky and the multiplayer version of the game is very laggy. Weapons are almost impossible to use with even a bit of accuracy. I would recommend one of the other 2D Worms games over this one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I do not understand the love of this game. i played it with some friends and it was absolutely sh*t-awful mouse controls that are inverted and have huge mouse smoothing and acceleration-Buggy mess-Lack of options-Spectating a player has about a 5-10 second delay so your always watching the player delayed-Making a 3D worms game was a stupid stupid idea. its not a worms game anymore and now its like a turn-based call of dutyif you want a good worms game then grab a copy of worms:armageddon. its been updated so it works on windows 7 machines (windows 8 works too i think) and it also runs 1080P.hell just buy any worms game thats 2D and avoid this junk			",198,26,3,15,20,0,24

												[UPDATED]Ultimate Mayhem is not bad, but fails. I'm a totally Worms fan and I shouldn't say anything bad about this series. Not this one. Story mode is a bit boring, but I have nothing against that. Worms 3D Campaign is frustrating (Why the hell I cannot skip the intro cutscenes?!) and sometimes broken (e.g. Sixth mission - it doesn't start because I had low FPS). Versus mode bores me. In most part, I hate aiming in Bazooka or other like this type weapons. I can easily get the opponent's worm if it isn't hidden, but if it does, is pretty hard. Throwing grenade in whatever number meters is senseless (I using them like a dynamite). Shotgun is useful only in middle and medium distances. On far distances crosshair floats and is hard to hit enemy (unless I have Sniper Rifle). Challenges are good, but too easy to beat devs' times (expect Deathmatches).Eventually I would rather back to the Worms 2D interface games (such as Armageddon, Reloaded, Revolution or Clan Wars) than ""torture myself"" in 3D version of this series. It isn't bad, but I recommend for those who thinks that 3D version of Worms didn't harm them. For now I keep away from them.Pros: Worms in 3D; challenges; interesting sound effects; comic particles; an interesting customization; it worksCons: Too bad it works; too easy challenges (expect Deathmatch challenges); so-so story mode; frustrating (and sometimes broken) Worms 3D Campaign; where's the old utilities (Blow Torch, Pneumatic Drill)?; no Level Editor; Versus mode bores me than enjoy; bugs; mediocre graphics; unqueal AI; ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Mines; the camera works; still it's a Worms game; BOREDOM!!!Rate: 3,5/10PS. Cause maybe I'm bad at Worms 3D games so I made some mistakes at writing this review?			",20,3,2,2,2,2,6

												This is a shameless copy of Worms 3d and Worms 4 compiled into one game that somehow manages to be worse than either of them seperately. They haven't balanced a single thing, not even the scandalously overpowered weapons. Searching for a multiplayer game will dim your screen permanently, you will have to restard. The netcode is just as bad as it used to be. There's a lot of paid DLC and promo items you get for buying specific other games. The menu screen is also worse than both of the old games. Worms 3d and Worms 4 Mayhem were PS2/Xbox games. Worms Ultimate Mayhem is a repackaging for the PS3 and Xbox360. There is absolutely no point in buying this if you play on a computer. The PC optimisation is poor at best, and still non-existant for Linux and OSX.Whoever was marketing this game either had no idea what they were doing, no contact with the people making the game or lied through their teeth all the way to the bank. Whatever the case, they have definitely never played worms in their entire life. My advice: go and seperately buy the original 2 games in a bargains corner. Do not support this kind of repackaging.

												The framerate sucks, the gameplay sucks, Worms should stick to 2D stuff and never try this sort of game again.EDIT:At least the developer reads these reviews. Thanks for that! I should probably write more informative reviews than ""this sucks""...It was mainly the framerate that makes the game unbearable, even on the lowest settings. Considering I can run high-end games on medium settings at 30-40FPS, the 8-15FPS on this game seems a bit ridiculous. Either my graphics card can't support the graphics engine (which seems unlikely), or there's a problem with the way the game is coded that's causing some sort of drag on my computer. Either way, I still prefer the 2D gameplay mechanics of the original worms. I don't think worms is meant for 3D. Still don't make another 3D game. Hope this review is a bit more helpful :)			",72,0,0,5,4,0,4

												Big fan of all the Worms series. This game is a pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥Cons:- Camera control is absolutely terrible. Just navigating around the level is a ♥♥♥♥ing challenge, beyond actually USING weapons.- ""Crosshairs"" and aiming system makes you unstable like modern-day FPS games to simulate your breathing, but its a ♥♥♥♥ing WORM in a CARTOON game. This is not neccessary at all and makes aiming with any weapon useless- If you leave the main menu open for more than a minute without clicking anything, the game automatically puts you into a cinematic mode where you are spectating AI playing. WHY. WHY DO I NEED THIS. Is this some type of in-store demo like on TV's? Why the ♥♥♥♥ does my full game do this? And no, there is No way to disable this from the settings/options. TERRIBLE. My alt+tab to do other things while waiting for a game invite ends up making me have to cancel out of and wait for the stupid cinematic to close before i can join my game, and you cant control the sound levels inside this viewDon't waste your money on this crap just because it has the worms title and seems interesting.

												One of the worst games I ever bought.  I was a big fan of the original worms.  It has a slower paced and very dumbed-down feel to it, and the sounds are completely childish, or even baby-like.  Nowhere near as good as the original, nowhere near as good as tf2, nowhere near as good as browsing youtube.			",94,12,3,27,30,2,53

												Nobody never gets the point of this,but I do. I've gotten Worms Ultimate Mayhem and Revoutlion late,and that's the reason I find that not much people play the games anymore. I end up showing late to the party,and not much people play the games anymore. It's just dumb. I never get the point of being late,but I have to bring this up. It's just not fair that I can't find any good people to play these 2 games. Can you just find a way to make it so more people play these games? Jazz Jackrabbit 2 had the same thing,but atleast they had servers still running up to this day...Can someone find a way to get more people to play Worms Revoultion and this game?			",6,0,0,3,1,0,2

												I hadn't played Worms 3D for ages, and this is basically an updated version of that game. The transition from 2d to 3d didn't work especially well for the Worms series, as it makes aiming and everything else more difficult and a little awkward... BUT the single player missions in this game are phenomenal and the visuals are absolutely gorgeous. This is honestly the prettiest game in my steam library.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

And now you can also edit maps, so the fun gets much bigger!!tl;dr Great game. If you catch it now, it's 3.99€ with all DLC. So much worth it.			",134,16,1,6,7,3,5

												What Worms in 3D?Yes, it works but it isn't the best. When it was first released I played it on PS2 and it worked good. On PC it's nearly the same, except the stupid controls. You need to change your keysettings here and there to have a good feel.The graphics look good. The Worms never looked better in 3D. They can wear hats and who doesn't love hats?The maps are still fully destructible but not physically affected. The mechanic to build your own weapon is cool but you would expect more. I still recommend it if you have friends to play it with.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

There are plenty of maps worth to play beside the random generated ones. Customize youre team to ultimate disrespect youre friends or humiliate them with a self-developed weapon.Nevertheless, the best aspect of this game is watching the other players to fail there rounds by walking in mines, not successing at difficult jumps or making mistakes by time shortage.9/10 after all.

												No matter your level of skill or innebriation, you'll drown half of your own team.Makes for a perfect party/hangover game.P.S. Picking ""crate drops only"" from the Wormpot makes for THE game mode to play with your friends.			",113,28,1,14,10,1,13

												Anyone who's ever played a worms game would know the basic concept. You play as a worm, your job? To kill the opposing worms. Obviously, the main  components in this game is multiplayer, but there's a few other modes for people who can't use multiplayer.... for particular reasons. Let's get right into the multiplayer! The multiplayer works just like every other worms game in the series, turn based. One player goes first, attacks... or not, depends, and then after they have either attacked or ran out of time, the next player goes. Before you start a match though, there's a slot machine, that can be used to randomly select 3 twists to add to your game, your you can choose them yourself! These twists are really interesting, and make every game different from the last. Some of them are; not being able to use anything but ranged weapons, you can only move using the grappling hook,or only being able to use weapons from crates! The online mode is basically the same thing, but no slot machine, and so is single player battles, except you play against a computer.The campaign is by far my favourite part of the game. At the start of each level, you are given an objective, e.g. destroy the building, kill the enemies, climb the tower, all that kind of stuff you would expect. The variety of different levels really keep things fresh, from a dinosaur attack, to the old western, nothing ever seems dull. At the end of each level though, you get coins, which can be used to buy things for your worms in the shop.The shop is where you can buy more things to customize your worms. You see, before you start the actual game, you should make yourself a team. You can name your team members, dress them up, and even choose a speech bank to make them sound like English Bobby,  or even a robot! Not only can you buy things to customize your worm with in the store, but you can also buy new premade levels based on the single player missions to use in multiplayer, or even new game modes! There is also a whole load of items you can only unlock if you own other games on your steam account though. In the end, worms ultimate mayhem is tons of fun with friends, also a whole load of fun in single player,  and with the immense variety of levels and customization options, you will not get bored soon. My final rating is... 8.5/10			",27,4,0,3,7,0,1

												I haven't played Worms in years, and I only knew one of the 2D title (forgot which one though) which was on Playstation or PC, I can't remember. Jumping back into Worms after all these years, in 3D, really changes things up for good. The 3D version does not play the same as the 2D in my opinion, but it is a great alternative. Hours of fun with your friends and lot of frustration guaranteed!			",359,78,12,53,33,4,58

Sad thing the CD key didnt work with Steam, but I got it in the Humble Bundle so it's a Win-Win situation. I don't see any of the issues apparent back in the day being fixed. I don't think this game was edited since then, it was just ported over to Steam to spread it to the masses easier.			",396,97,11,26,32,4,28

												Worms 4 Mayhem and Worms 3D put together into one game, with some DLC on the side of you want to fork out some more.Very fun game to play, though if you've got Worms 4 Mayhem and Worms 3D already.. Why bother? It's a big price for the only bonus being steam achievements and DLCs. If you have lots of friends to play games with you, it's a nice game to grab just to mess around, and I certainly would get it for that. It supports 4 players, which is generally all you need in a turn based game like this.I wasn't amazingly fond of the game, but that's because I've fully played both Worms 4M and Worms 3D. There's not a whole pile of content new to this game unless you buy one of the currently 3 DLCs.Post-game? Why bother. It's very hard to find anyone to play with, there's never anybody in a lobby waiting for anyone to play. You'll be expecting exaggeration until I tell you there's less than 20 people who will actively play multiplayer for this game now and then. With it not being a ""new"" worms title, there's never any new players to fight online.You could play offline, sure. It's alright for a while until you actually notice some of the crazy stuff the CPU' AI manage to pull off. Have you ever managed to throw a grenade like that and hit someone point blank from across some of the larger maps without having to get it stuck in a dip in the map? No? I can say I haven't, so I don't see why these bots should do.Overall? 5/10Fun for a while, then it just sits in your library; begging for people for you to play with.			",70,18,2,5,10,3,5

												If you've played the old school Worms games, such as the all time classic Worms 2, you'll have a bit of a rough start. The learning curve isn't exactly forgiving, as now you play in a kind of ""First Person"" view mixed with 3rd person for movement, which is totally alien to regular Worms gameplay.Don't rule the game out just yet, though. It's quite fun, as pretty much all worms games have been, and it's a good refresh to the series, also. There are cutscenes (although of quite poor quality) with humorous remarks about your next mission and so on. The 3D is OK and just because you expect it to be cartoonish, the lack of complexity is barely noticeable.The campaign is fun and tries to make sense and create a purpose for you to just keep playing level after level, sometimes just to see what the Worm General has at bay, hidden in his invisible sleeves.I'd give this game a 7.5/10. It's a good time waster, both for casual and more hardcore players. Oh, and the hotseat mode makes it a good game to have when your friends come along and you run out of options on what to do!

												I used to play older versions of this and had a blast with friends. Came back got it .. we played a few games, it was fun not gonna lie. The problem is that it's FULL of bugs and glitches ... to me it feels like an incomplete alpha version.Not to mention that in about 4 games we had the server just suddenly dropped ... it's really annoying when we're in the middle of it all and server just drops.The game is clearly abbandoned and no one is going to fix all the problems it has, it's a pitty really ... a little bit of finessing and the game would've been great to play with friends.I say it might be worth the 2. something euros on sale ... but it's not worth the full 15 ... not in the state it is and will remain.

												UNDERRATED GAME. NEEDS MORE ONLINE PLAYERS.Worms Ultimate Mayhem is a small bundle of Worms' 3D classics re-made with extra goodies. An easy buy for me. Anyone who's played Mayhem or 3D should definitely look into this. I have nothing bad to say about it other than the occasional (I guess to be expected, however) waiting periods in multiplayer as well as new voice overs in singleplayer which sort of tries to redo the comedy of the original Mayhem campaign. Funny at times, sure, but nothing beats the good ol' quick and witty story texts, which they kept in for the ported Worms 3D campaign. Look into the deluxe edition, it's good value. Super good on sale.And if you're still not sold, lemme tell you of one of my CLASSSICCC experiences:Christmas Eve, made an OP airstrike that dropped presents on my opponents. Made the weapon myself, of course. Called it ""Merry Christmas"". Never lost a match, I should add. Except for that one time where I accidentally killed one of my white-bearded, red-hat-wearing team mates. But we don't talk about that time!			",55,1,0,4,2,0,4

												Probably the best 3D Worms game. The plot is nice, and so is the gameplay. Making a custom weapon is probably my favourite feature. Add some more weapons and Customisable worms and you have Hat Fortress 3 a real masterpiece.Get it right now, if you still have some money then also try Worms Forts!			",142,22,5,7,13,3,19

												When WORMS entered the 3D realm, it was not a graceful transition - Lets be honest...But it worked and worked well... The Graphics are as Cartoony as ever and all the usual features that made WORMS such an epic franchise are still there... The Holy Hand Grenade, The Customiable Teams... Everything!Camera Angles can be awkward - This was a game better suited to teh console beyond any doubt, but the PC Version is still great fun!Now for the BAD SIDE:The game is a bit of a memory hogger, so you need a good PC to run it - And there are some compatibility issues.I have owned the Physical Hard Copy game now for many years - On my older laptop, it played well - but this one I have now produces a ""Black Screen"" bug which can be a pain in the backside. All sound - No game play!I do not know if this has been fixed on the DRM Version, or of any fixes that are available... Though I have heard rumor that a chap called ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ created a patch - If he has, I have not been able to find it.If you do know your PC can run the game, Its a must have for worms fans... But please be sure that your PC can run the game first.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a wonderful party game. There are few games out there that can match the humor and incredible accesability of the worms series. All the wonderful explosive goodness that was captured in the 2D versions (reloaded being first amoung this) is now supersized into full 3D glory. This is a game best enjoyed with 3 of your close friends, playing late at night and laughing hysterically at the built in humor and of course... obnoxiously fun explosionsIgnore the paltry metascore of 66, this is a game that should not be missed if you have friends over with any frequency			",381,26,11,35,36,3,43

I don't think I would pay the full price, but if you are looking for a humourous, fun game that gives you hours of endless fun (which doesn't make sense :P), this is the game to get.

												This is a great game to play with a few friends either locally taking turns on one computer or online. If you can get it during a sale I would definitely recommend it.			",126,16,3,8,16,1,39

												I grew up playing the original 3D and 4 Mayhem. They meshed the game into one, and it turned out great. Though I missed  Forts Under Siege. But still, good and goofy game.			",88,29,1,26,10,0,23

												I used to play older versions of this and had a blast with friends. Came back got it .. we played a few games, it was fun not gonna lie. The problem is that it's FULL of bugs and glitches ... to me it feels like an incomplete alpha version.Not to mention that in about 4 games we had the server just suddenly dropped ... it's really annoying when we're in the middle of it all and server just drops.The game is clearly abbandoned and no one is going to fix all the problems it has, it's a pitty really ... a little bit of finessing and the game would've been great to play with friends.I say it might be worth the 2. something euros on sale ... but it's not worth the full 15 ... not in the state it is and will remain. BOTTOM LINE : It's a fun mess.			",24,0,0,1,2,0,4

												This game definitely contains a lot of fun, just take a bunch of your buddies and enjoy killing and murdering each other. There are plenty of maps worth to play beside the random generated ones. Customize youre team to ultimate disrespect youre friends or humiliate them with a self-developed weapon.Nevertheless, the best aspect of this game is watching the other players to fail there rounds by walking in mines, not successing at difficult jumps or making mistakes by time shortage.9/10 after all.

												Anyone who's ever played a worms game would know the basic concept. You play as a worm, your job? To kill the opposing worms. Obviously, the main  components in this game is multiplayer, but there's a few other modes for people who can't use multiplayer.... for particular reasons. Let's get right into the multiplayer! The multiplayer works just like every other worms game in the series, turn based. One player goes first, attacks... or not, depends, and then after they have either attacked or ran out of time, the next player goes. Before you start a match though, there's a slot machine, that can be used to randomly select 3 twists to add to your game, your you can choose them yourself! These twists are really interesting, and make every game different from the last. Some of them are; not being able to use anything but ranged weapons, you can only move using the grappling hook,or only being able to use weapons from crates! The online mode is basically the same thing, but no slot machine, and so is single player battles, except you play against a computer.The campaign is by far my favourite part of the game. At the start of each level, you are given an objective, e.g. destroy the building, kill the enemies, climb the tower, all that kind of stuff you would expect. The variety of different levels really keep things fresh, from a dinosaur attack, to the old western, nothing ever seems dull. At the end of each level though, you get coins, which can be used to buy things for your worms in the shop.The shop is where you can buy more things to customize your worms. You see, before you start the actual game, you should make yourself a team. You can name your team members, dress them up, and even choose a speech bank to make them sound like English Bobby,  or even a robot! Not only can you buy things to customize your worm with in the store, but you can also buy new premade levels based on the single player missions to use in multiplayer, or even new game modes! There is also a whole load of items you can only unlock if you own other games on your steam account though. In the end, worms ultimate mayhem is tons of fun with friends, also a whole load of fun in single player,  and with the immense variety of levels and customization options, you will not get bored soon. My final rating is... 8.5/10			",27,4,0,3,7,0,1
