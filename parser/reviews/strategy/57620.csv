												It's been a while since I've written a recommendation for a game, and it's a service I feel the community really needs doing, so here we go:Patrician IV, henceforth known as ""Patty IV's"" is in something of a niche genre, in that it is a Renaissance trading  simulator set around the Hanseatic League in Northern Europe. Doesn't sound like the most riveting game now, but when I rephrase that as TIME TRAVELLING DOSH SIMULATOR 1420 EDITION it starts to sound ♥♥♥♥♥ing dank. (Note to self, make montage video with that title)Patty IV's behaves something akin to a sandbox, and the main campaign introduces you to the core concepts in a really intelligent way rather than simply throwing a standard tutorial at you, whereupon you start with modest resources as a simple hemp smuggler operating out of Lubeck aspiring to grow his empire until you control all the booze and kush in Denmark.The difficulties in the true sandbox mode work pretty well too, they basically make more bad things happen the higher difficulty you select, like pirates stealing your♥♥♥♥♥♥or bad winters freezing ports over as well as ramping up the costs of production, so that in order to maintain a decent profit margin you actually have to spread your goods out intelligently. Because of this, on the higher difficulties you truly end up as a wicked beer baron, having to ship your product all over Europe to find enough people keen for your booze and bud (Stockholm can't get enough hemp for some reason).Once you've gotten enough dosh behind you from your 'legitimate businesses' you can move into the world of protection, racketeering and exploitation. You can create fleets of pirate vessels or hunt the pirates that menace your trade. You can be 'elected' in charge of a town and pay off the local authorities to leave you in peace. You can build 'schools' where the goal is to design bigger guns for you ships or ways to grow danker kush. You can even pick up some wench and start 'The Family' (watch that ♥♥♥♥♥, I caught mine cheating once).Have I mentioned that it doesn't stop there?WELL BUCKLE UP KIDSIT EVEN HAS A GODDAM CO-OP MODE FOR TWICE AS MUCH DOSH.Because by know you're already clicking add to cart I'll discuss the DLC now, so you can wrap it up in one easy purchase.The expansions adds some pretty legit content, so if the gold edition is an option go for it, but the game isn't fundamentally handicapped by missing it out. I even managed to drop about 50 hours into the full edition before finding the key feature of smuggling booze and 'exotic spices' overland that the DLC introduces. It seems like there were a lot of little tweaks that were added with Rise of a Dynasty too, including some fixes with the aforementioned co-op mode, however, so I would recommend picking up the pack if possible.This is a ♥♥♥♥ing wicked game, potentially the best game to play while you're browsing the net or whatever at the same time, which is ironic due to it not being terribly casual. The reason it has a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ metascore is because all the reviewers are cowards that don't want to put any effort into learning how the systems work, which are relatively easy to understand and smooth to operate. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s are too busy giving 9.8's to on rails shooters to learn how to run a criminal syndicate, uh, I mean 'trading syndicate'. I wouldn't say the game is immaculate, but it's challenging and interesting in a fun way, and I don't regret sinking plenty of hours into it. The ship combat is a little dry too, but that's not the focus of the game.If you like simulators or relaxed strategy of any kind I'd say it's a must buy.Overall I'd give TIME TRAVELLING DOSH SIMULTOR 1420 EDITION 80/100.

												Patrician IV is an odd trading game. Costs of goods are predictable such that you can assign an administrator to buy and sell goods based on specific criteria. This ability is also inherent to your trading ships if you desire to assign it so. However, the cost of production is always the same thus far. The cost of wheat at a production market is always 39 unless the ai purchases the supply beyond its average value. This means a great deal of automation can be assigned and you're free to sail, build or do what ever you want....which involves trading so you're free to do more of what you just automated.Naval combat has designated ai that you can override and assign to attack specific vessels. Cannons will not fire unless you are in range and in a reasonable facing. Dodging shots is a bit iffy since it usually involves rapid decceleration by lowering sails and turning. It has interesting elements but I think I prefer sid meyers Pirates simply because combat can be broken up by duelling and boarding action. Its a beautiful game but so far theres not much excitement to it. I dont seem to age so  time seems to be irrelevant. The over all challenge seems to be go as high level as possible which can be done simply by automating tasks and letting it run unattended while i watch a movie. Intermittently building a few buildings to add workers and ships. While I like the game, its not for everyone and probably not for a lot of people I know. So on that basis I can't recommend it.

												Great game. Love the trading and the building and everything happening on the map. So what sinks the game?  Sea combat. I rather play Empire TW or Port Royale sea fights rather than this. It is bad in the beginning and becomes even worse as game proceeds. For me it finaly breaks the game. Early game you can just resolve fights automaticaly or do the ye old pirates style '1 fast ship to nibble them all to death' strategy. Later on it becomes extemely tedious due to bad UI and weird constraints on movement and firing. There are so many things one rather do than try to do manual sea combat in this game. And autoresolve will not help you in mid to late game when pirates get strong and tight constraints are in place when it comes to how many ships you can bring to a fight.			",776,311,45,87,97,7,148

												I was very reticent to buy this after all the bad reviews in the initial launch period. After i went through the bug fix list and compared to the reviews, it looked like they fixed / adjusted a lot of them and decided to buy the game. I do not regret it. The game has been significantly improved over patrician 3, sea combat can be a bit challenging but once you get it, its not bad. The focus of the game is economical, which is does extremely well. Prices, the supply and demand systems are well balanced, grahipcs are good, interface has been modified with the updated patch and the trade route system redesigned. In short I recommend it.

												If you like trading, making money, and killing pirates, well you've come to the right place.  If you want action, adventure, constant battles then simply this is not your game.  Graphics are reasonable, interface is enjoyable.  There is a slight learning curve and how to best set up your routes/convoys will be what you spend most of your time doing.  OCD folks will love it, but if you are very ""hands off"" management style it might not be your thing.I love it though. ",70,21,1,25,62,0,42

												Having spent numberless hours playing Patrician III, this game was a must buy for me. Couldnt have been more wrong. This would have made an acceptable Patrician II since is clearly a step backwards.Patrician IV its clearly worse than its predecessor.

												There aren't many games out there, where the point of the game is to traid and to do some capitalistic♥♥♥♥♥♥ One of them is definitely Patrician IV. I've been playing the game for some time now and I think it is time to say something about it. These games can be boring sometimes, and this or similar kinds of gameplay, are usually part of some bigger game. But the thrill is not in the gameplay, it is in the role that you are playing. In this particular game you take the role of a merchant in medieval times on the Baltic sea. Your goal is to be the biggest merchant of them all. And as far as the story goes that's about it. So, as you can see, there isn't much of a story. But there is a lot of trading to do and you have to industrialize your production of goods and trading roots.  For the gameplay I can say it is simple as far as handling it goes. You don't have any trouble trying to figure out how to do things around there. The mechanics of demand and supply are realistic and you can quickly overproduce or oversupply a market of a city that you came to trade in. So in that way you have to be careful that you always keep them a bit short on supplies.There is one thing that is in this game and has to be mentioned separately, and that is the naval battles. You can have naval battles with pirates or you competitors, but these battles are not big ones which is little bit disappointing. You can only have fights 3 on 3. Never the less, it is a welcome change in the monotone playing experience.I am enjoying playing this game, but I think that those who like more action will be bored. That's why I am giving the game 6/10, and I gave it a rating that high just because, I like to play it once in a while when I feel that this capitalistic world is not the best decision that humanity has made.

												I was not expecting to like Patrician IV as much as I did. The first historical trading sim I tried was Port Royale 2, and I found it plenty enjoyable to sail the Carribbean and snap up goods to offload for a profit. Patrician III does the same thing across Northern Europe, but it was a little too involved and challenging for my tastes. I assumed IV would be similarly complex, but to my surprise it was far more my speed than any of the others I've played.Like its predecessors, Patrician IV places you in the finely-tailored boots of an aspiring merchant in the Hanseatic League. Starting with a single ship and counting house, your goal is to make your fortune across the many ports of Northern Europe and Scandinavia. Each city produces four or five goods from a list of about twenty, but consumes all at varying rates. To that end, they require traders like you to ferry goods around to supply towns and help them grow, and make a tidy profit while you're at it.The basic trading is probably the best of its kind, thanks to some clever quality-of-life improvements. Buying and selling is done on a slider between your convoys or warehouses and the town, allowing you to quickly and easily pick exactly the right amount to give or take. A helpful four-dot display also shows you the effect of your trade on the city's overall supply, which is important because good trades for the city improve your reputation with them. In just an hour or two routes will start to become obvious to you, and you'll be zipping around the sealanes loading and unloading your wares.Reputation in the many ports grants you access to construction options, allowing you to build your own industries and move on to selling your own goods at market. Your farms and workshops will produce goods for you to trade at much greater margins, thus expanding your operations across many cities. This phase of the game is helped by a very comprehensive trade route editor, which lets you specify which goods to load, unload, or trade at every port on the route, right down to specific quantities and price points. It's an elegant system that will see your profits soaring almost immediately.There's plenty more to do in the many buildings found at each port. You can make business deals and loans, go on patrols and hunt pirates, or even woo a spouse. These secondary activities aren't as complex as they were in Patrician III but still add welcome variety to your trading adventures. Additionally there are endgame goals like being elected mayor and completing major projects for your cities as before, so there will always be more to do no matter how great your company grows.Patrician III had all this and more, but it was hidden behind some steep learning curves and unintuitive designs. I'm happy to say IV is a major improvement on this point, mainly by having an extremely useful campaign questline to follow. These missions will ease you into every aspect of the game by giving clear instructions and context, and then leaving you to work out the execution. I've found much more success in this outing thanks to this, along with the clearer messages and polished user interface.The cost of this accessibility is shallower gameplay than in III, but pulling back from such a deep well is not such a bad thing. Overall, IV feels just right to me, a perfect balance of complexity and fun. The graphics also help with the inviting feel, though fans of the previous crisp pixel cities may be disappointed. I love the soft colors and simple models of the new engine though, and the sound design completes the gentle, inviting ambiance that relaxing sims thrive on. Patrician IV managed to surprise me by shooting to the top of my sim list, and I'm looking forward to many more hours with it.			",488,212,8,71,62,7,65

												A really well done game. I find it even better than Patrician III due to the improved interface and some nice little additions like research at a university. The only thing I can find that might have been done better in Patrician III was how building ships and buildings at a town takes material from the town market even if you have the material in your warehouse, but I suppose this was some sort of play balance decision. It hardly detracts from the game though. I really find it more enjoyable than Patrician III.All in all a really in-depth trade simulation game which will offer many hours of addictive play. Wish they made more games like this to counter the unfortunate 'dumbing down' trend of games lately...			",89,6,0,23,34,0,63

												Patrician IV is a trading strategy game based (loosely) on the historical period of the Hanseatic League. It has been a board game and Patrician I was released about a decade ago. If you are a fan of strategy games, then you have probaby already heard of (and have) the original version. If you haven't heard of it, think of the strategic map view of Medieval Total War, but with the activity done by ships, not the armies.Essentially this is the same as the orginal. The graphics and sound are slightly better, but this doesn't impact gameplay. One improvement is a 'rating bar' against items in each market to show demand - this makes it much easier to make money without a running a spreadsheet alongside the game. The automatic buy/sell through your warehouses has been changed from the original, but splitting the buying from the selling on different tabs has made it fiddlier to manage your administrators. A better tutorial is included for new players.I played the original version of Patrician for hundreds of hours and the lack of major changes means that I'm expecting to get hooked again. So, for experienced players, this is worth the upgrade fee during Steam sales whilst new players should enjoy this even at full price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As a big fan of Patrician III the rise of the hanse, i was most interested to see in what ""improvements"" had been made in the next instalment in the series.And i can happily say they've made some very nice touches :)- Graphically stunning and gorgeous - Ability to zoom in and out on your ships / towns- Tracking bar to let you know how far off the next social rank you are :)- Low price to buy the game is a win win- The game it self is not very different from number III. only the modernization of the game is. graphics wise and interface wise.- The game runs smooth as a babys bottom with no technical issues encountered. i am running win 7 ultimate 64bit. (built for gaming). just an fyi hahaand many more key features that i cbf to list lol.

												For a build-up game that's in its 3.5th installment, I would have expected more.The game concept is nice, but whoever was in charge of designing the game control mechanisms should be fired! Automatic trade is tedious to manage:- an '(un)load everything BUT' option is still missing (as with earlier versions);- trying to select a destination city with the mouse repeatedly results in the program switching it with another one, or simply nothing being selected at all;- cities can only be added or deleted completely, not just the destination changed;- and to top it all off, the game keeps arbitrarily changing certain settings of trade routes back to its own defaults, WHILE THE TRADE ROUTE IS BEING USED!Specifically, this means that loading your ship from your storehouse in a city will occasionally get changed to buying from the city instead. Quite a big deal when you wonder why your funds aren't getting ahead for hours.The counting house manager seems to sometimes just forget to do his job, as was the problem before with Patrician II.Also, when quantities get really large, the default trading amount is increased - which is good for manual handling, but it sometimes seems to prevent the manager further from executing any orders, e.g. when lump trades change the average trading price and he consequently doesn't act at all. Although I'm not quite sure if these two might not just be same problem after all.The overall game flow suffers from bad priorities for messages. Various events are lumped together as 'task accomplished', without specifying what it is exactly: a returned loan you gave, or a mission you took on.To know for sure, you have to check the history list - where you then have to delete and confirm every single item of e.g. returned loans to keep the list clean.Other times, your advisor/uncle - or worse, a competitor from one of the many cities - just pops up and delivers a spoken message while you were just trying to micro-manage some part of the game. You can usually just ignore the competitors, but as far as I can tell, the advisor-uncle only says everything once.I probably forgot about 4-5 things that annoyed me like hell too.As I was saying: The person(s) responsible for this mess should be fired.Anyway, if all that doesn't bother you, the game is somewhat more charming than its predecessors.Further on the plus side, the uncle's tutorial tips don't try to micro-manage your game. He only shows up at major milestones and you are free to act in between as you wish.I will probably spend a bit more time with this game when I'm bored. But I'm not going to get addicted or look forward to playing on, like I could have.A truly mediocre product with a great idea and name. :-(			",2,0,0,4,1,0,8

												Simplistic, time consuming and strangly addictive.The concept of the game is simple, you're a trader in the Hansiatic leauge, and you have too expand your trade empire. How? By selling and buying a number of diffrant goods, all from Hemp, bricks, pelts, salt, wine and much more. The whole game is built around supply and demand, you buy goods were its cheap, often were the goods in question is produced, for example logs and mead from Stockholm or wine and wool from Colonge. These goods you will then need to deliver all across the Baltic sea and the northen Atlantic. After a few hours you might have enough money and respect in one of the cities to start producing your own goods, maybe you will start a grain farm in Lübeck and have it delivered to Riga and Malmö. The trading is very very simple to learn but hard to master, you will trade by sending trading ships into diffrant towns ( or if you have a counting house in the city you can sell goods from your local storage) and then sell any goods that you have on the boat. You can avoid all the micro management later in the game by setting up basic trading route running along maybe three towns. You can with this system have a boat sail from Stockholm with a bit of logs and hemp, and then have it sold in London were you then pick up wool and iron, you can then inturn sell these goods in Oslo were you pick up Salt and bricks that you take back to Stockholm and restart the route. The Combat in the game is quite small, you can turn into a pirate and harrass your compeditors, but also you will need to defend your own ships from organised pirates that sail all over the Baltic sea, the battles will have you control a max of three ships as you order them what kind of ammunition you want them to fire and what ship you want them to target. But this really does not effect the main gameplay that is trading, Later in the game you will also be able to become mayor in a town, this enabling you to construct certain buildings and increasing the size of the town. With all this put together there are still some flaws in the design of the game, at times it can seem too micro heavy to handle and often you end up unable to handle the changes to the trade, you sometimes lack an overview over what effects your income outcome and how you can change it, the tempo of the game might also scare away anyone who is not willing to put a sizeable ammount of time into it. Despite this I find this game to be extreamly addictive, this is not for the large cool battles or the huge cool citites you can construct, but because I can have an impact on the flow of trade around the whole region, I can utterly destroy the price on hemp or spice, and ruin my enemies chances on a market on that specific ware. This can enable me to buy up the market and then I can sell it to a very high price instead, the effects of your trade matters and you can have an complete blast seeing how your trade empire grows month after month. 7/10 for one of the best medival trading simulators out there, it will challange you to be effective in your trade, and plan out a strategy for how you will become the most popular and richest trader in the Baltic Sea.

												Info: Haven't played any previous game before.I feel this game is pretty shallow, unless I missed something.After awhile I got bored, there is no incentive to stay playing. Except building more production and trade more to gain more income, and the cycle repeats with no clear goal. The campaign is basically tutorial, a really bad one at that, no good explanation on the game mechanic. It is one of those game that you just build for the sake of building more stuff at the end.Only 3 ships that are unlocked from the start of the game. I didn't see any options to unlock more ship types, if I miss it, a correction would be nice.A bit buggy, I had the characters speaking sound completely disappear, along with portrait not going away like it should, randomly and it stays until restart. Some visual bug too.I really like trading/managing game, but this one is just too boring. Along the 10hr I played it was 2 play through. 1 was campaign in which I get to the highest ranking and felt there is nothing to do anymore.			",68,21,1,22,42,2,32

												At the beginning Patrician IV is a simple little trading game--buy low, sell high. As you become wealthier, it instead becomes a game in logistics. Successful players will find themselves creating spreadsheets calculating distribution of goods among their many towns. This uncommon feature at this stage of the game makes the game worthwhile for those who like challenges that make you think.I bought this and ""Rise of a Dynasty"" together and played too many hours in the base game before I discovered that the ""Special"" Steam Edition is a stripped version of ""Rise of a Dynasty."" If you can, play ""Rise"" and leave the Steam edition in the dust.			",162,47,3,39,12,4,52

												This game is a economic builder game. Its does the market and demand well. The trade aspect of the game is good. the rest of the game however is not so great. The sea battles are frustating. Your ships seem to have a mind of their own and do not position themselves that well while auto targeting.You are litterally pulling your hair out yelling at the computer positioning your ships. I had one ship try to break off from fighting but as soon as you click off the ship it turns back to engage. What could have been  some fun, a little break from trading is just a MAJOR dissappointment. Its so sad you hope the battle ends so you can get back to trading....its just done that horribly.The NPC challengers  do not develop their cities to compete with you. By the end of the game you will have to build all the cities up yourself to create demand for your goods. This game is long so I have no idea how you multiplay this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												6 hours of glitches and crashes.For a trading simulator it's just too simple.I bought Patrician IV to try to switch from The Guild 2 (another game full of bugs and glitches).Even The Guild 2 been really glitchy, it's really nice and I just look the other side.However it's impossible to do the same with this one.I will have to wait for The Guild 3. :P			",148,16,0,26,21,0,45

												If you like trading you will love this game. A lot to do and nicely balanced. You will need to keep an eye on your trading empire and get involved in politics and pirate hunting to succeed. The negative reviews surprise me. I think a lot of the old bugs have been fixed, especially with the DLC. Also, some people complain that it is not as good as Patrician 3. I like them both equally.If you like economic games and trading games, you will really like this!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While it is a fine game as standalone, it is a major downgrade in comparison to Patrician III IMO. Graphics are real 3d in version IV, but version III has the better gameplay and a much more informative interface which is a lot easier to handle and get stuff done with. So if it is not all about real 3d graphics to you, you will be better off with Patrician III. I will nevertheles recommend it, because gameplay is ok, it is just by far better in Patrician III.

												I played a lot of P2 and P3 many years ago. I recently purchased the PR3 and P4, for ~$7, hoping to get back to it. P4 is a huge disapointment. It is a much lesser game in every aspects compared with P3: graphics, trade routes, battles, bugs. There are absolutely nothing I like. I did prefer PR3 to P4. If you are new to this, you could get going with PR3, it is simple, betterlooking and overall better than P4. The problem with PR3 is it is way to easy and the battles are also really boring.So back to P3 for me. I don't feel my $7 was worth it.			",13,3,0,4,6,0,5

												This is a very fun and highly addicting game. However, it isn't the game for everyone. It'll only appeal to people who can appreciate complicated economy systems and a lot of strategic planning with repetitious maintenance requirements. The game is all about economic growth. You buy low and sell high, over and over again, which would seem boring after a short period if it weren't for the automated trade convoys and various other automated options for accumulating wealth.  Players can rent houses, produce goods, hire an accountant to manage foreign affairs, sell captured ships, trade between cities or even entire oceans--there are a multitude of methods for achieving your financial goals, but money isn't the only motivation. Players can also achieve reputable statuses within cities, and even achieve diplomatic ranks which allow for the player to control a city's development even further. To most this may all seem rather boring, but if you're like me, it may just be worth the investment.			",164,23,2,24,13,2,32

Disconnecting from the network before starting the game fixes the problem but there shouldn't be this problem in the first place.

												I tell my ship to buy goods at a city with a trade route, doesn't buy them. Needless to say it doesn't sell them at another city either.I thought it was the prices at first but no, I set them to the prices in those cities correctly.So non-intuitive. I tried many things and it still doesn't buy nor sell anything.Also why can't you see both what you're buying and selling at the same time? You must click a button called ""Trade Mode"". I am forced to press that button constantly. In the meantime, such a huge portion of my screen is blurred out because I am in this trading menu. Why couldn't the developpers make that trading window bigger?Super annoying.			",137,9,9,29,17,1,46

												In some games where you play as a ruler of a nation, conquer lands and advance in technology and civilization, one can usually build markets and set trade routes with other cities. It's the same, except that's the whole point of this game. Seriously, you buy things in one city and sell in another. And you grind your way up.It wouldn't be as bad, if there was a decent tutorial, consistent user interface, meaningful missions or just a bit of sense of humor. Right now is as exciting as doing taxes.			",80,8,0,7,9,0,2

												I've spent most of my time on the 'Rise of a Dynasty' DLC, 17.9 Hours to be exact, since the DLC loads separately even though it uses or check the base games files. I know very well what the DLC does and does not include, and I will not be factoring features of the DLC in this review.Patrician is a great nautical trading game. You buy low, travel to another city, and sell high. As you gain more money, you buy more ships so you can carry more goods. Then you can start a second Convoy(a team of ships basically), and assign it a route. A route tells the ships which cities to go to and what order to do it. You can tell them what they should buy and what they should sell in that particular city. And they'll do all that without any more input from you, and they'll be earning you money in no time.You can even start producing goods yourself, and have dedicated ships to deliver it to another city either to sell high, or give it to another goods producer you own so they can make more complicated, and therefore more valuable goods to sell. You gain favor in a city by selling them goods that they are low on, which makes them like you more. Once they're happy enough with you, you can start buying buildings in their city, and producing goods unique to them.You can also take up Contracts/Missions/Whatever at the Pub. This ranges from delivering a certain amount of a specific good, or even hunting down a specific pirate or rival.One thing it's starts losing quality on is sea based combat. Most of the time, you'll just want to let the fighting resolve automatically rather than take control yourself, since it's rather boring. Once you start getting more well known in the game, your ships will be attacked by pirates more often, and sometimes not even towards you specifically. Sometimes they'll park their boats outside a cities port, attacking anyone who comes or goes. Most of the time, if you lose, they'll just take a large amount of your goods, and sometimes a ship, and let your convoy go. To counter this, you can assign specialized boats with armor and weapons to fight, protect, and even scare off pirates on occasion. You can even put cannons on your merchant boats, however, this subtracts from overall storage space, but it's worth it if a specific convoy gets attacked a lot. Sometimes though, they're just a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ and you'll have to send your own specialized combat convoy to take them out permanently, since no one else will do it.There's a lot of trading to do in this game, and the DLC will add quite a bit more. I'll need to write up a review for 'Rise of a Dynasty' too, but later.I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys trading games,			",514,157,9,113,76,5,171

												Bought the double pack which included Port Royal 3... played that for a bit and liked it... then thought I'd give this a go... I feel massively cheated! It's exactly the same game, except worse quality. Avoid! Definitely not worth the money, I was expecting something more to the quality of The Guild 2, huge disappointment for the 4th installment of a game.			",42,53,0,21,52,0,18

												This game will not install by virtue of refusing to accept product codes.  Your support will not allow inquiries and side steps by referring me to non steam venues that wouldnt know about Steam  product codes.  I rue the day I became involved with Steam and would not recommend you to anyone.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												DON'T BUY THIS THING! Just DON'T !You logged into steam ? GFWL ? uplay from ubisoft ? origin from EAgames ??IT'S NOT OVER , you have to log into ""kalypso"" now !You need an email adress and a password to log into a ""KalYpso thing"" in order to play maybe one day.Why do you want to play this game anyway ??? IT IS SO FUNNY TO SPEND YOUR TIME CREATING NEW  ACCOUNTS EVERY♥♥♥♥INGWHERE AND GETTING TRACKED AND SPAMMED FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE ! ALL YOU NEED IS TO GIVE KALYPSO 29.99 EURO.There are so many better games that are just ""click-and-play"", don't bother for a game worse than Patrician III, unless they have patched the login page to an offline launch.Don't waste your money with KalypsoGames whatsoever. eVEN THE TROPICO SERIES FROM POP TOP AND BREAKAWAY WAS WAY BETTER THAN THEIR RELOAD			",161,10,33,25,37,0,66

												I paid an arsonist to set fire to a competitor's business. The fire spread and burned the whole city. 9/11 never forget.			",37,5,0,30,21,0,11
