												Played this one before the days of Steam, back when the game was advertised on websites as a banner ad. A classic indie game that deserves a whole lot more attention and love than it got.Starts off a bit slow with a bit too much dialog I'll admit, but give it time and be patient, and after a while it becomes a really addictive and fast paced action/strategy game. It's like, if Asteroids had an open-ish map where while you're fighting stuff and mining resources in one location, the enemies are doing the same in other locations and taking away your potential resources to build better ships and guns and stuff.Also, the character art looks like something from deviantART. However, the ships and gameplay graphics look great! It has aged fairly well (but be warned that the max resolution is 800x600 with no widescreen modes!!)More people need to know about this game. So... go play it or somethin'!			",163,10,5,12,13,1,15

												Interesting mix of shoot'em-up bullet hell games and 4X strategy. You can explore the Universe, fight through thousands of various enemy units, research new technologies, build a lot of stuff and experience the storyline, something that 4X games usually lack. The music is awesome, too.However, the storyline itself is somewhat shallow, character depth is nonexistent, and the game only runs at 640x480 and 800x600, forcing you to play in Windowed mode, if you have a 16:9 monitor.Overall, it's a great game, which I played for around 30 hours outside of Steam, and 13 more hours here. It's not worth the full price of 10 dollars/euros, because it's outdated, but you should definitely grab it during the sale.			",670,216,18,74,63,4,106

												Starscape is a curious fusion of an arcade and a turn-based strategy game. The arcade component is in total domination, but as long as it is not backed by strategic advancements, it tends to become overwhelmingly hard.The main feature of the game is addictive gameplay. Despite the simple idea (""collect resources to become stronger, but watch your back and take offensive actions to collect intelligence"") the gameplay is extremely immersive. The whole stroy takes ~12 hours (or less on low difficulty levels) to complete. The storyline is not bad, but not too bristling with events.From purely technical point of view, the game mechanics is trivial: the more resources you collect, the more powerful you get; and few things can prevent you from collecting resources. Whenever you save a game, it is always easy to load and avoid any serious danger you get into. It is possible to think of circumstances resulting in 100% death, but I have never encountered such a coincidence in practice. The only thing the enemies can do is substantially delay your advance. SUMMARY: plot is simple, but intriguing, graphics is nice, strategy is straightforward. But there is something in this game that makes it addictive and immersive. An insight into this game is highly recommended. Slightly overpriced (for a reason).			",12,4,0,0,4,0,16

												I have seen this game ten years ago.  I bought it about five years ago from a non-Steam service and promptly lost the ability to play it.  I saw it up on a flash sale and promptly bought it.  It is a testament to the game that it's imagery stayed prominent for so long with me.  Either way, the game is SPAZ before SPAZ existed.  Do not buy it expecting the same polish from a game with a decade of tech advancement inbetween.  That said, it's a fun romp through space mining resoruces, builing tech and blasting aliens.Story is shaping up decent for the first hour of game too.  We'll see where it goes.

												This older game is a more modern take on the classic Asteroids platform. Shoot asteroids, suck up all the resources, use those resources for research and development against aliens, yes aliens!It's showing it's age with the limited 2D art styles, but as a quick and easy pick-up-and-play for only US$10, it's quite worth the price of admission, especially with the sheer availability you will have on Steam.

												This is actually a really fun game at first, when you are first upgrading and manipulating your ship.  You can make missile boats, blaster-based ships, you get option drones to fire when you shoot, and so on.  Mining is actually somewhat interesting to fool around with early on. It, however, gets repetitive, starting with mining, and then upgrading, and finally the combat.  The final ship components cause all end-game ships to look the same, and the final boss has a stupid mechanic which requires you to either have a way more responsive ship than the game gives you, or to angle a shot in a way that gives you a generally unsatisfying win because you didn't do the high-agility maneuvers that it feels like you should do.  It caps the game off with not even allowing you to have a solid victory in the final ""cutscene.""Overall, a good 75% of a game marred by an overly repetitive final zone.  If you don't mind this, and the late 90s graphics, go ahead and get it!  It's actually pretty fun, reminiscent of Asteroids with an upgradeable ship and uh, better graphics, though still a far cry from anything you'd call ""modern.""			",91,32,0,39,6,0,33

You really have two ships. The ""mother"" ship is also customizeable and upgradeable, but just the single hull and it will come to your aid and fight/mine as well.Now I really want to create the sequel to this game :) Or play it.

												Killed some time with this back in college, but it's pretty meh.  Collect resources, upgrade your mothership and your fightercraft, research and build...but the mechanics don't come together, it feels shallow, the interface is a pain, and it doesn't do bigger than 800x600.  The concept isn't flawed, it's just too small: the mechanics would have been fine in a shorter game, a flash game, that kind of thing, but stretched out to full-game length it suffers.  This game doesn't need a strategic map, but you have to slog through it anyway.  Worst of all is that it caps what you're allowed to research pretty aggressively, so early in the game you're sitting on max levels of resources that you can't spend.  Way to identify the fun part of the game and then kick it like a puppy, guys.I still have fond memories of this game though, mainly from one night when I heard the starbase alarm going off, said ""Hey wait my mothership is still at full health"", and realized it was my next door neighbor playing at full volume.Verdict:  Go play Tyrian instead.  That's what you really wanted anyway.			",174,55,0,26,40,1,35

												Basically Starscape is somewhat fun, and I played through it a long time before I got it on steam, then I played half through and the past days I finished it. The game has nice mechanics, but it is repetitive. The story could be interesting, but somehow isn't really in the end.There are only 2 things which really bother me about it.1: The resolution is limited to 800x600, which brings a lot of problems on newer hardware, and that resolution even bothered me way back then.2: There are achievements for finishing the game on Easy, Normal and Hard. As opposed to common sense, finishing hard does not give the other 2 achievements as well, so you'd need 3 playthroughs to get all achievements, which is ridiculous.If someone has endgame saves for easy and normal, please take a look at the discussion section of this game, it'd be cool to have those 3 saves here so the achievements could be achieved properly.So yeah, with those flaws and after all this time it's just not worth 10€ anymore. If it's ever on sale again you might consider grabbing it if the points above don't put you off.			",68,6,1,8,10,0,21

												Starscape is a very pleasant combination of Asteroids with a plot and some other gameplay types: a bit of adventure, a bit of tactics, a lot of fun.  You shoot asteroids to get resources (you need them to build parts or repair your fighter or base); all the while you're under attack by all sorts of enemy types.  You can research new parts -- fighter hulls, engines, shields, weapons, batteries -- which you then need resources to build.Time is paused while you are in your base station, so you can choose what manpower to allocate to research or building, and you can arrange parts onto fighter hulls to try new tactics.  However, stuff doesn't progress until you get back out into the action.  And don't take too much damage out there or you'll use up the resources you need for building new toys, and have to go get more.  This is so fun!I bought this (and Mr Robot, the other game by Moonpod) before it was available on Steam.  I liked it enough that I bought it again on Steam.  Nuff said.			",272,77,3,25,24,1,69

												Ah Starscape... what's not to love?Space shooter? Nice.Physics based handling? Not bad.Upgradable ship designs? Pretty good!Lots of semi-interesting characters with a less than vomit-inducing plot? Not great, but it could be worse.So... what's not to love? Why's this a thumbs down vote?Well... here's the rub: the handling on your ships is very realistic, but it's slow and clunky. I'm alright with that, normally. It requires some planning of momentum and some good piloting to be competent, and that's fine.The problem is that the boss battles aren't designed for the controls nor the physics of the game. They assume perfect, pristine, pin-point keyboard turning in rapid order. I'm fine with that if the interface made such a realistic possibility. Unfortunately, starscape's boss battles are like waltzing into the olympics' figure skating event wearing cross country skiis.It doesn't matter how good you are, the controls simply flat out SUCK for trying to fight the bosses, and player skill seriously only has a very small amount to do with it. Someone with godlike reflexes could theoretically get through in a few tries, but most of your boss battles involve being expected to start moving out of the way before a boss even begins to box you in, without knowing when or where that attack will come from. If your ship were even remotely possible to be set up to cope with that, great, but it's not.Keyboard turning and physics-based thrust maneuvering simply doesn't work for the style of bosses that Starscape throws at you.The rest of the game is fun and fine, a few minor nitpicks here and there, but it's good overall... but the act-ending bosses are mandatory, and they suck HARD. I don't mean ""it's difficult"", I mean it in the sense of ""this is one of the worst design decisions I've ever seen anyone ever make... did they even play test this to see if it was fun?"".Any fun you get from the game will be sucked dry as soon as you're stuck in a boss battle, and since the controls and interface flat out aren't up to the task of fighting the bosses, it's going to make you pull your hair out over it. I highly advise staying the hell away from Starscape just in general. Unless you're a masochist, then go right ahead.Anyway, to stress it again, there's a difference between ""difficult"" and ""bad design and poor UI/controls"". Having a♥♥♥♥♥♥poor interface does not equate to ""difficulty"", it just equates to being BAD.Final Verdict:Not worth it, even if it's on sale for $1. You'll probably break a keyboard that cost more than $1, even if you don't have a history of such, and are a pretty mellow person normally. While the game has lots of really good points to it, and does a lot of stuff very well, it's flaws are gamebreaking. When you put more effort into fighting the game's interface than you do fighting the boss, the game's a bust.Score: About 35%. It has some really good stuff, but the flaws are devastating and overpower any potential the game had.			",165,31,1,20,21,2,40

												Any of you grow up playing SubSpace? That old online top-down space shooter, that could have been the first MMO? (lots of players per server, 'till the very end, and that game was OLD - the days of dial-up. Beat that.) Well, this game feels a bit similar to that and Asteroids - fly around in a spaceship, blow up asteroids, and like in SubSpace, collect stuff to make your ship cooler. But in this, you collect minerals from the asteroids and enemy capital ships with a tractor beam, and you can only hold so much before you have to drop it off in the hangar. To actually make stuff out of it, you have to do some R&D - research better stuff, then actually build it. Both actions take minerals, and there's only so many minerals per area. And they don't come back. Thankfully we have a dangerous zone with infinite resources. *gulp* Oh, and this will play on pretty much anything. Woo!			",161,11,0,23,12,0,35

In order to do this, you have to mine minerals and save lost crew that you can assign to help speed up the research and build times.
