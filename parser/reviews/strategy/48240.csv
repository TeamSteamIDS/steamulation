												I have this game. I LOVE this game.However, I cannot rate this positive at all.UPlay may be a joke, but it is a sufferable joke. The real problem is much scarier than that.----------SolidShield.----------What is SolidShield?SolidShield is a software DRM engine that was built for corporate applications, NOT computer games. In the business world, people only upgrade computers once every few years. By the time they upgrade a couple of times, the software is obsolete and has been superseded by a later version.Many gamers are completely different. A lot of us format our machines at least once a year, sometimes more often than that. A lot of us change our hardware semi-regularly as well, particularly video cards, hard disk drives and memory.This is a huge problem, you see, because all of these changes change the hardware fingerprint that SolidShield uses to 'protect' its software payload. It's akin to the Windows activation system with the very major difference that it it is extremely hyperactive, and very intrusive.According to Ubisoft, who has said in the past that the PC gaming market is terrible, we are never allowed to change our hardware configurations. If we do, we are obligated to buy a new copy.Ubisoft says piracy has caused them to require this ridiculous DRM system, which isn't suitable for games at all.I counter that the existence of SolidShield in this product is causing people to prefer pirating this game to buying it. After all, if you pirate it, you'll actually be able to install it when you feel like playing it in two years' time.I've never before seen a company that shows such a disdain for its customers. If it were up to me, I'd remove ALL DRM from Anno 2070, and give it away for free (or a lot less than its $60 price tag) as an apology to all of us for having to put up with this travesty.Until TAGES SolidShield is COMPLETELY REMOVED from this product, I cannot see how anyone could possibly rate it positively.

												Now, before I begin, I want to say that I applaud the studio who wrote this, this is one of the best games I've ever played.  HOWEVER, I will never buy another game using Uplay.  After playing this game for about a year I finally bought the expansion I was so excited about.  Well, that was the biggest mistake I've ever made.  Deep Ocean introduces an autopatcher proxy bug which I cannot fix without going out to some sketchy link on MediaFire to get a FUNCTIONAL autopatcher.  That is, unless I go in and download the game through Uplay.  Without the patch the game is registered as ""Game modification detected"" and has no connection to my login and there is no text on any of the menus, unplayable.  Supposedly there has been a fix out there for Uplay-only users but I don't have the time or bandwidth to redownload the entire game.  I just want to play the freaking thing.  Please go back to fingering your butt Ubisoft, it's all you ever do.-Slightly annoyed ex-customer			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I want to give a thumbs up, but i will explain with complete honesty why i did not: game is great, game is good, game is full of fun, play it. just one issue Uplay = U-DONT-play. it barely worke on my♥♥♥♥♥♥computer, then i got a great comp (FINALLY)  and guess what? Uplay dosnt work. Honestly if this is the route that game comps want to go, ill just go back to buying disks if that could work as an alt to NOT have to face online interfaces. Just let me play my game. I dont care about online states, Im playing a strategy game that i want to play ON MY OWN. I honestly dont care about online points or which of my freinds built the Dam before I did, I jsut want to play the game I paid money for!P.S. I got around it by downloading Far Cry 3 again since that is attached to a more up-to-date Uplay, and some have done it just by downloading Uplay else where, but my point still stands, as sometimes even when all the planets align and everything works perfectly, Uplay decides to f you over. Hopefully we all find a work around because the devs of the game dont deserve the flak on this great game brought about by their employers			",104,9,0,15,28,3,40

												This is where the Anno series take a dive, and it's all Ubisoft's own fault.Let me repeat these:1) No game should ever force you into having an active internet connection when playing a singleplayer game.2) And no singleplayer game should ever require an active internet connection in order to use in game items.3) And no game with active connection requirement should ever wipe your progress clean when you are accidentally offline, without any remediation.Ubisoft managed to ruin Anno 2070 by making all 3 mistakes. Sorry, couple these with a UI interface that alienate big screen, I just can't go on.			",127,68,2,35,32,0,18

												FIXING UPLAY:UPVOTE THIS SO EVERYONE KNOWSThe reason Uplay crashes when you try to launch from Steam is because Uplay does not install properly when the install is queued/prompted by Steam itself. INSTEAD, download and install the standalone Uplay launcher.THEN, run the new standalone Uplay install and log in with your account. NOW, you can launch the game from steam as usual as long as Uplay is running and you are logged in.			",98,7,3,13,16,0,22

												DO NOT BUY. Ubisoft's Uplay is a broken piece of software. Since it implements an always online DRM, this often makes the game completely UNPLAYABLE (broken ubisoft servers, buggy uplay software crashing, etc.).

Unfortunatly this review will not describe the pros and cons about the game Anno 2070, since its DRM called ""uPlay"" by the worst gaming company in the world (even worse than EA) ""Ubisoft"", keeps crashing every time I try to launch the game.Even though we keep telling companies like Ubisoft to skip their own platforms and DRM stuff on Steam games, they keep doing it. Uplay do have something called ""Auto login"" which allows the player to start the game from the Steam library without touching filthy Uplay, I would definatly accept this step, but the problam still remains, Uplay game launcher KEEPS CRASHING AND WONT LET ME PLAY THE ♥♥♥♥ING GAME.This negative, non-recommending review is not to blame the developers but Ubisoft and only Ubisoft.

												Good game, but Uplay is♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off.Actual Review:Anno 2070 is an amazing resource management sim. It's very fun to slowly develop your colony into a thriving city with somewhat complex supply lines leading to other colonies.However, that's all well and good until you go to 'war' with the available factions. The combat is just awful, mostly because only air/naval units are available.  And even those are really limited to fight with. (2 aircraft, roughly 4 attack vessels)The game is a really good concept, but for me after a few hours of gameplay I've maxed out my cities and all that's left is to fully eradicate my 'opponents'. Note opponents being barely true as everyone is just trying to survive. There never really is a reason to attack someone unless you struggle to maintain relations with them.The graphics are beautiful however, and the OST is somewhat interesting. uPlay is of course absolutely horrid, most likely it will take you about an hour to get the game working, that's if uPlay decides to deny you entry to the game you just paid for.I can't recommend this as late game there really isn't anything to do.

												Before I get into the utter disgrace to the gaming industry that is Ubisoft, I have to say that the game itself is absolutely fantastic. Brilliant and immersive in both its gameplay and UI, studying the most practical and most efficient ways of marriage between trade and development in a world of a realistic near-future setting, really a great addition to the Anno franchise. However, despite the game's overwhelmingly positive qualities, DO NOT buy this game through steam. The publisher, Ubisoft, especially Uplay, ♥♥♥♥ed it in the♥♥♥♥♥with a foot-long cactus and completely ruined the experience from the start. This is a fair warning, to spare you the details of nightmarish hours of technical difficulties with it being a non-steam based game trying to use another game distributing software, save your time and money and hope for Ubisoft's demise as everything they touch descends into oblivion. I can only pray for Anno 2205's fate as any franchise sharing a destiny with Ubisoft is doomed to collapse. Game - 10/10 ""Great addition to the Anno franchise"" Ubisoft - 1/10 ""Assassin's Creed was alright, Uplay can suck a fat one""			",80,12,2,12,19,0,21

												Anno 2070 is a very good game! When compared to older Anno games they've really taken some bold moves and they do work well. However, I am NOT RECOMMENDING this very GOOD GAME. Related designs (the developer) has done nothing wrong, Ubisoft (the publisher) does a lot of things wrong. I will tell you a bit about the game, but also WARN you about Ubisoft and their pushy ways. I wish someone told me before I bought this game, because I wouldn't have bought it! Please read along!A few years ago I was playing CivCity Rome. Off course I had heard of Anno, but untill then I had never played it. Then I tried Anno 1404 and I was instantly sold. Anno is a citybuilding game that is always set in a specific era. Instead of needing power and water, your citizens would like to have food and goods that you need to create for them. You build your city (or cities) on a map consisting of a bunch of islands that each have their own resources which you will need to create the goods you people want. When their wishes have been met, they grow a level. This causes the house to grow and support more people but it also generates more taxes for each citizen living there. Anno always goes very deep, you have to manage the fleet of ships carrying the goods around, time them, have the right amounts in stock etc, and sometimes when I'm about 24hrs into one sandbox game, it starts to feel like a lot of work! You must keep the production going, sell excess goods, don't go bankrupt, build that monument, manage trade routs,,,Anno comes in many flavors, just pick your favorite age and go! The latest installments are the most consistently playing ones, and with this new Anno 2070 they really made the game a lot more accessible to new players and old players alike, when it comes to the amounts of resources in a map for instance. I have a few minor points of critisism about some of the made choices though. And for me, the futuristic theme is ok, but the style is a bit bland for my taste. For instance, in Anno 1404 the palet of colors was more vibrant on my led-tv for instance. I also like seeing dozens and dozens of wooden sail ships being processed at a big massive harbor, rectangular electric ships just aren't the same. When it comes to graphics in general, this Anno is really good looking with the later effects though. I still prefer 1404, but it's a matter of taste. The action (yes, there is also warfare, limited islands and resources mean war! sometimes) is still not really spectacular and really... I don't like it. I like the building and trading! I have not played this Anno a lot or a long time, but it plays familiar enough to judge that it is a good Anno. Related Design does not screw up their beloved Anno I think! Anno games are generally good, this one is no exception... however I personally still prefer Anno 1404, it also comes without Uplay, the reason I'm not recommending this game!I would score the game 8/10 if it weren't for the game's publisher Ubisoft. I would really like to warn you about them! Really annoying buggers they are!Usually here on Steam, when you buy a game it downloads and you can play it. No worries, no fuss. Sometimes there is some online DRM, annoying and pointless but ok... Sometimes it's an online game, understandable that they want you to create a seperate account with them. But then comes along Ubisoft and their pushy Uplay ""services"". I know one thing, it's no DRM. When you buy a Ubisoft game here on Steam, as soon as you have paid for the game and you have downloaded it, it takes you away from Steam, pushes you to create an account at Uplay (which is Ubisoft's marketplace/Social Media), that is being published publicly. So in other words: you're in Department store A, you buy product X and as you put it in a bag to take home with you a salesperson from Department store B comes along and forces you to create a public membership with their store, while you were in the first store to begin with!Afterwards, you can look in your settings to get your profile to be blocked from the public again if you want to, but as far as I'm concerned the damage has already been done. Who do they think they are, Facebook?!?  When I accepted my fate and tried to apply for Uplay, it was impossible due to server problems! When I got tired of waiting to create my public humiliation, I went looking for fora. It seems ever since it's creation, Uplay has been plagued by downtime. When I waited these weeks in a row to create an acount and get confirmation I actually bought it, Uplay already existed over a year! And it also serves no further purpose. It does not autopatch the game, it just 'checks' if it's you and if you're allowed to play the game. Yes, what Steam already does. It annoys you with 'unlockable goodies' for games as you play (stuff that already was in the game and screenshots(!), but blocked because of idk, so you had something to unlock online), you can start finding your friends again, it needs to be constantly online while you play the game. Also it downloaded the game again as soon as I managed to create an account.Look at it this way. Valve is singlehanded carrying the PC-gaming sector by itself. It saved PC-Gaming and has achieved Cult-status. I mean, come on. Well over 60 Million people choose to be here on Steam. Ubisoft is just pushing their own store upon unsuspecting people walking around in this store! And then publicly humiliating them with their social media crap. They are trying to ply away the customers and public from Steam. If you have read this review, and then still buy any Ubisoft game... you clearly do not share this view of Steam, and I wish you a good day. To those that agree with me: if you have a game in your steam library that requires this Uplay crap, please write a review about it!When we look at EA, we can see that they have Origin as their store. When I buy an EA game here on Steam ""(like Command and Conquer or the Sims), EA does not push me into an Origin account. We can all hate EA for a lot of reasons (for me it's Red Alert 3, C&C4 and that city game that came between simcity 4&5), but I give them credit for that! The games that do require Origin (Fifa, SW:TOR, Battlefield and Simcity) are not for sale here.I can accept another marketplace that digitally delivers games and software. No problem, competition is very healthy! But I cannot understand why Valve allows these practices. I mean, go ahead and try this in real life. Try to lure people from a Department store into another and I bet security is kicking you out! It's just common decency! I am not going to buy another Ubisoft game untill they either close Uplay entirely or stop pushing it with their games! That's 100% certain. I would probably have bought something there eventually, but not after this, I'm done with Ubisoft.Anno, to me, is a singleplayer game! I have played a very few games of Anno 1404 with a friend, but not a lot of people feel like going for a 24hr game in multiplayer. Still, with this whole Uplay non-sense it does not play offline! There is no reason to force something as intrusive as Uplay down our throat with a game like Anno. After that short period of being very angry with Uplay and Ubisoft I decided to delete the local content and delete Uplay. The whole attitude of Ubisoft with their Uplay causes me to score the game with 3/10.Ubisoft, please change your ways! If you don't trust Valve and Steam in their sales, don't sell your games here! Stop pushing your complete store/social media like this!!! Related Designs, please ask Ubisoft to change their ways, or go find a new publisher, I am not buying the next Anno as long as Uplay is still on it. I'm also not playing Assassins Creed 3 or 4 or Far Cry 3!I have created a group about Uplay, please join if you agree: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/boycot-ubi ",56,2,4,9,19,0,14

												The game itself isn't horrendous, but the Ubisoft U-play DRM is absolutely terrible.  Not worth anywhere near $30, and the DLC is pricey for how little it actually adds- most of it's just re-skins.Additionally, I'd have to say that the gameplay is very lacking. It has 2 factions, but they play very similarly, and no matter what campaign you do most of what you build is repetitive.  All in all, a poorly-made game made nearly unplayable from DRM. 3/10, would not recommend.			",27,4,0,12,21,0,32

												Beautiful and fun game for this type of genre. Very well done interface outside of actual game as well- with the factions, faction reputation, events, global voting events to 'elect' officials that boost different stats every week or so. I was, and still am, very impressed with this emmersion. Unfortunatley, its really no longer maintained well by Ubisoft. World events are, as of this posting, no longer going on (and you pay for these as part of game and DLC). Tremendous problems with their third party DRM ( in the multiple years I've owned this I have had no less than 5 issues that were gamebreaking and had to be resolved and hindered playability). In addition, since updated Uplay workings (around Sept 2015) I have had problems saving the game. It was working fine and then this happened - not sure 100% if it a causation effect or just a correlation. This is not a game where you finish too many levels in one sitting hence it has made the game all but unplayable for me! As a game - I highly reccommend it. I very much enjoyed so many aspects. However...The condition of the game, and how it simply just doesnt work well these days - I would not reccommend you buying. Hope this helps a bit in your choice to buy or not!			",8,5,0,8,5,0,9

												This game has some of the worst DRM I've seen in a while. After several crashes, reboots, forced Uplay install and account registration, product key entries, and a gazillion updates, I am now two hours into the install and still haven't played. At this point, I've lost any interest in playing this game and supporting Ubisoft with their draconion DRM, especially when Steam already handles DRM and updates just fine. So not worth the 12 dollars. I'd rather have my money back!Do not buy this game (purely based on the DRM and installation process)!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This review doesn't reflect the game itself - it just reflects the experience after buying this steam wintersale offer.The game itself is a good one - not as good as ANNO 1404 with Venedig Addon (espionage for example), but it's a great game though.Ingame graphics are really detailled and looks just beautiful, the animations are full of life and love!DO NOT BUY IT, if you don't want to buy an over-drm'd game.**********This is the story after buying and installing the game:The installation process gifted me the game, the tages copy protection and the ubi game launcher. You have to register not only at steam - you have to register at ubisoft too. Okay, steam is not the problem - but registering at ubisoft is.But i am really trying to start the game since one hour... not possible. Something missing here, registration progress not complete, game not activated in ubi game launcher... going to offline and then online mode again: oh wonder, ANNO 2070 appears there.Good, going into offline mode again, because i don't want to have a fulltime connection to ubisoft. Starting ANNO 2070 in offline mode - it should work, right? The game launcher said, it's possible of course.Hah! But not with the commander... ""connection to server error"" and a ""Login"" Message since 8 minutes. Huh, what about the offline mode? I am not interested in UPlay onlinemode...

I am not interested in drm♥♥♥♥♥♥like this. It's no joy, it's just frustrating!---Overwiew:- You have to own a steam account- You have to install TAGES copy protection- You have to install the Uplay Game Launcher- You have to sign into another vulnerable online service at Ubisoft- You have to be ONLINE at least for the first gamestarts - starting offline will not start the game, even if you already have activated ANNO 2070 via STEAM and Uplay Game Launcher.- You have to enter a SOLID SHIELD PROTECTION key- And now you have to have much luck to access an available Ubisoft Loginserver.Now we have december, 28th and i couldn't start the game until now.---Decide yourself, if you want to buy a overprotected game like this. I wouldn't do it again.If you think, my review is totally wrong, then do a research within the STEAM forums or the internet itself. And trust me: The people are not the problem. They're not to stupid, to start a game. This is the classical ""fail by design"" feature of some companys.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Anno 2070 is a very relaxing, and an incredibly in depth RTS. I call it an RTS, but it is an economy focused RTS, and can be played entirely without any combat or war what so ever. The focus of the game is on building your society up and seeing to your peoples needs. The single player features a story driven campaign which serves as a good starting point to learning the basics of game play. There is quite a steep learning curve to this game, but luckily there are a lot of resources online to aid new players. Also there are some really in depth guides hear on Steam that can help out in a variety of areas. Don't be put off by the massive amount of information involved in this game, you can learn how things work, and why you do it is very satisfying.Graphically Anno 2070 is demanding, and you'll want a high end card to get the best out of the graphics. But it looks great, for sure one of the better looking stratagy games out there. This game is probably more like a city building game with a strong emphasis on economy, and supply chains. So if your into that, you'll really enjoy this. The pace of the game can be slow a steady. If your looking to build up and make everything work, you need to take your time. So the game, once you get the hang of it, is very relaxing. If you have any interest in this sort of thing at all, you should pick it up. And hey the developers even removed the always online DRM, so you can play offline :3 SUCK IT sim city! ",124,15,1,15,30,2,39

												I bought this game when it went on sale last Christmas, I'm just glad I only wasted less than 20 dollars on it.  Do not waste your own money on this game.  The ""U-Play"" totally ruined it.  There is nothing worse than developers who put games on Steam that make you have to then join ANOTHER social network just to play them  It's extremely annoying and pretentious. I don't give a crap about rankings, sharing my game progress, finding opponents to play against, Playing online with other people or the ""Lastest exciting news"", which is just pile of steaming DRM hooks.  I just want to play may games solo in peace, and without having to jump through hoops of fire everytime i click the startup icon. ",97,13,3,37,29,0,37

												While I thought this was something of a City builder... it is infact a VERY complex log on simulator... in which the player must attempt to navigate through a maze of logon's coupled with seemingly random patches... before once again being forced to log on... I made it to what I assumed was the first Boss battle log on (or at least the title screen) before being ambused by a wild side quest in which I was asked to log on... sadly I lost the battle (you are informed of this when you recieve the dreaded ""connection to Ubisoft server lost!! ) I am going 0/4 stars on this one...  might raise to 1/4 after I tackle that boss mob again though...

												A great strategy game!!! Try to get it on sale like I did, its totally worth it for 8 or 10 bucksIMO : 9/10 Don't trust the negative reviews from people who can't apply a manual patch to play a game, read a simple tutorial, or just use their brains to download an update.A ""short"" tutorial if this is your first install or if you never used Uplay before, like in my case.1 - Install the game like any regular Steam game2 - Run the game, let the autopatcher do its thing.3 - After autopatching, the game will try to run the Uplay client so you can log in/create a Uplay account, which will be    linked to your Steam Account.4 - The Uplay client WILL CRASH, yes we all know it, UPLAY SUCKS, but this happens because the uplay client in the game is outdated5 - Go to https://uplay.ubi.com/ and download their latest client. Install it. Run it, and Log In/Register for the first time.6 - Close the client completely (even from the taskbar).7 - Go to Steam, lunch the game, and voilá  the Uplay client will work, log in, link your Uplay account with your Steam account. And for an easy access, let Uplay remember your login data so you only have to click play on Steam, and get right into Anno 2070.Thats it, enjoy!			",132,15,2,12,8,0,34

												TLDR - I find this game both relaxing and challenging. Take UPlay out of the picture and this game comes highly recommended!It saddens me that there are so many negative reviews for this wonderful game, and all of them are due to the draconian implementation of Uplay. I've been lucky enough to not have any problems with Uplay or the DRM, so I will speak only to the game itself.In the new, wet future, you are charged with rebuilding society and wrestling the dwindling resources from what is left of the waterlogged planet. Maps consist of several islands, both above and below water. Your goal is settle a colony and grow it accordingly to meet your citizens needs to work your way up to the tech level needed to satisfy the mission objectives. You start each map with a single ship, and enough supplies to get your first colony going. There are 2 major factions: ""ecos"" and industrialists, and the third faction, techs, are available to both. You can also start building with the opposite factions buildings after you have reached a certain level of citizens. Each faction has several tiers of development, with the highest tiers requiring an insane amount of scarce resources/factory combines to get the finished products needed to satisfy demand.  Each map has different objectives, and you are given a lot of freedom in how you want to meet your goals. Do I want to spam out a lot of low end housing and industries, or work my way up the chain to produce more lucrative products? Either approach, or a combination of the two works - but your citizens get increasingly needy and harder to please the further up the tech trees you go. Random disasters and events (some scripted) also crop up to keep things interesting. It's pretty easy to stay on top of things and zip through some of the earlier missions, where you only need to deal with a few different resources and citizens needs. The later missions, and especially the expansion ones, will have you scrambling for dozens of hours to keep up with your multi-island society of thousands of citizens. It is incredibly rewarding to finally beat one of these after whittling away at it for close to a week!Important to note: There is some combat, but the focus here is supply & demand, logistics, and keeping your balance out of the red. If you like RTS games, or lots of action, you probably will not have a good time here. One thing I really like with this game, and wish was the case more often, is that it does not hold your hand every step of the way. It runs you through the basics, theres a database/help module, and the many different types of alerts warn you when something major needs your attention. Systems are there to automate trading, both at each island depot themselves, and trade routes with ships. There are tons of technologies to research, and even more to unlock through discovery/rewards - however many of these that you will need to complete mission objectives are quite well hidden. This part could probably use more in-game explanation, as I had to search online several times to find out how to get what I needed.This is definitely one of those games that makes you lose time and sleep - be careful playing if you have to be up early the next morning!

(NOTE: Anno 2070 was released during the dark days of uPlay's always-on DRM. Some people have had terrible troubles with it, and others none whatsoever. In 70+ hours I have had no issues with uPlay, but I understand that others have. If always-on DRM is a dealbreaker for you, feel free to ignore this game and this review. Otherwise, read on.)The Anno series made a name for itself with supply-chain-based building and beautiful historical cityscapes. 2070 took things in a new direction, at least aesthetically, setting your constructions in the near-ish future. Global warming has settled the debate over itself by flooding the entire planet, and you are tasked with helping humanity resettle on the few habitable islands left. It's an unusually somber game that manages both a striking beauty and extremely satisfying building.Unlike your SimCities or Tropicos where money is your limiting factor, Anno 2070 challenges you to provide goods to your citizens to both build with and subsist off of. Every building requires building materials like concrete, steel, and tools before it can pop into existence. Your citizens likewise need quotas of food, beverage, luxury, and entertainment to expand their numbers. There is money, paid as taxes by your citizens and used as upkeep for your industries, but it's generally an afterthought once your initial settlement is built. Your main concern will be building supply chains in the right proportions to keep your cities growing.The result of this balance is that you're building two kinds of settlements in parallel, residences and industries. The catch is that you're doing this on limited island space, and your industries can have dire effects on their surroundings. Islands have an eco-balance rating that can boost happiness and production if positive, and tank your agriculture and cause disasters if negative. Each island also has its own particular resources, so you'll almost never get by building on one island. There's a robust convoy and trading system for you to automate deliveries with, as well as fleets of charming ships to build and explore with. Get far enough in and you get submarines and the ability to build underwater industries, too.There's a 12-mission story mode that serves as an extended tutorial for the game, along with another dozen scenarios, an infinite mode, rotating event missions, and multiplayer modes. For each of these you can choose one of two factions to start as, the filthy capitalist Global Trust or the crunchy hippy Eden Initiative. Both have very different needs and industries to fulfil them, which lead to very different play styles and looks to your cities. Late game progression unlocks a third faction of scientists to grow in parallel, and very late game you can even unlock the opposing faction to build as. You get an enormous amount of freedom in how you build, trade, and expand, which helps keep each map interesting as you progress.On top of the faction and building options, there are NPCs to trade with, missions to complete for bonuses, upgrades to research, and military options to explore. It's a huge game with a lot to like, but not without a few stumbles. The aforementioned military options are actually pretty awkward and unfun to use, leaving conquest as the last option you want to explore. Research produces random results so it can take far too long to get the upgrades you want. And beyond the mechanics, the story and voice acting elements are half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at best and add very little to the experience.These are really minor quibbles about an otherwise spectacular game, though. The look and feel of Anno 2070 is second to none, with intensely-detailed buildings and landscapes that produce some of the most picturesque creations of any city builder. The challenges of aligning production chains is never too great but are still extremely gratifying to overcome. Spending a dozen hours on a single random map is not out of the question, resulting in a breathtaking sprawl of future cities, industrial hellscapes, and ecological paradises. Anno 2070 is easily one of the most engaging builders I've played, and its few faults are hardly enough to keep me from sinking dozens upon dozens of hours in it.			",488,212,8,71,62,7,65

												Want to put this out first, I love the game. Anno 2070 itself is a fun game with lots of stuff to do for those of us that like managing production chains and move goods around. On the other hand, the forces software (uplay) I hate.Yet sadly I can't recommend Anno 2070 because of the uplay software that Ubisoft is requiring to play it. Uplay causes 2 main issues (amongst others) with the game.First is if said uplay's servers act up you are forces to play in offline mode which means you don't have access to you ark and it's storage/upgrades and many other features they decide to tie into Uplay. So a good portion of the game is unusable.The Second issue is like what is happening right now as I write this, where you can't even play the game since some unknown issue is happening and you are unable to get past a login screen in the game, mean you can't play a game you paid for, not even to play single player campaigns.These are the two reason I've not bought a single Ubisoft title since anno 2070 and can not recommend a single title of theirs not matter how good the games are.  Their game can become unplayable at any time their servers shutdown and any time in the future they decide to stop support any of their titles you will lose access to that game, even it's supposed single player sections.Edit: fixed spelling and grammar issues			",109,16,0,28,19,1,41

												I assume this game would be enjoyable if not for the DRM-infested turd fest that Ubisoft forced on us. I just bought the complete editon because of a Steam sale. I read that it required 3rd party DRM but I assumed (incorrectly) that it would actually... work. Ubisoft requires the user to install Uplay which, to my chagrin, crashes every time I log in to play the game. This is completely and totally unacceptable for a game released this long ago to crash every time because of some ridiculous DRM. Go ahead Ubisoft, show more contempt for PC players who actually pay to play this steaming pile of garbage.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Anno 2070 offers the perfect synergy of RTS, City Building and Trading. I recommend the complete edition because the Deep Sea expansion adds a layer of extra depth to the tech trees.In Anno 2070, the size of your city is limited only by the size of your island--and there are some really BIG islands. If for some reason you aren't satisfied with your island, build some nukes, launch them, watch the pretty mushroom clouds and then move into your newly acquired glass parking lot (island). Don't feel like remediating nuclear radiation from your newly conquered paradise? Try sabotaging your enemies' main food source--destroy an oil tanker off the coast of an enemy island (preferably next to their fish hatcheries) and while he/she scrambles to clean up the oil, harass the cleanup crew with fast attack boats or helicopters and then send in your attack fleet. Even better, with the Deep Sea expansion, you can create tsunamis to wipe out your enemies' coastal holdings by destroying strategically placed geothermal power plants. After all, your citizens are worth more than your enemies' citizens, especially if your enemy happens to be the Eden faction... those hippie tree-hugging ♥♥♥♥s! Pick the Tycoons and use the power of coal and nuclear energy to crush the little Eco ♥♥♥♥♥! There's no Captain Planet to help them against your rain of nuclear fire! Crush them and their tree covered islands and pave over everything with concrete!Anno 2070 is not your typical city builder. As I explained earlier, this game is more of a hybrid City Builder, RTS and Trade Sim. Unlike traditional city builders, Anno 2070 has warfare. If warfare isn't your thing, you can play a peaceful game or you can eliminate your enemies through economic policy (hostile takeover). A hostile takeover is not as intricate as it sounds because all it involves is buying out enemy island shares until you have greater than 50% but, it adds another unique aspect to Anno 2070 game-play.Another feature that sets Anno 2070 apart from other city builders is that you, the player, have 100% control over everything that is constructed. Compared to traditional city builders where the AI constructs buildings after the player zones an area for residential/commercial/industrial--Anno 2070 gives the player COMPLETE control over all structures: construction, destruction and placement. This is the perfect feature of the anal-retentive City-Building fanatic because it allows the control freak to CONTROL!Placing buildings in Anno 2070 is almost like playing a puzzle game. Its always good to maximize space so when you're building in Anno 2070, be prepared to destroy and rebuild. I have over 200 hours in my current continuous game and I've rebuilt each of my major cities 3 times. I also razed and rebuilt the entire power grid across all 29 of my islands (largest map size). The reason for the rebuilding is pretty simple--I keep thinking of better and more efficient ways build, produce goods and house my citizens. My 3 largest cities started with max populations of: 29,000, 29,500 and 34,000 and each of them barely had enough power to keep on the lights. Now, those same islands boast populations of 34,500, 37,500 and 40,500 and each island has 1000+ excess power to share with the power grid.Honestly, this game is a blast! The only reason Anno 2070 doesn't have 'Overwhelmingly Positive' reviews is because people hate on the Uplay DRM. I agree that its annoying but, its no reason to avoid one of the best city builder/rts hybrids of all-time.EDIT: I noticed a number of people complaining that Uplay doesn't work for Anno 2070. Since I hadn't played in a few weeks I decided to boot it up and see if there was a problem. Uplay works just fine. The Steam version of Uplay is outdated. You need to update Uplay and everything works just fine.The fix for this is so simple its mind boggling how many people fail to see it when its mentioned in numerous threads within the community hub. I know the Steam fan-boy knee-jerk reaction is to hate/blame any third party DRM so I guess I shouldn't be so surprised.EDIT 10/17/2015: I see the reviews for this game keep slipping BUT not because the game-play is bad. The reviews are slipping because a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Steam fan-boys hate Uplay DRM. Sorry boys but, Uplay works just fine and has done ZERO to inhibit my Anno 2070 gaming experience.UPDATE 11/24/2016: Anno 2070 is still the best City Builder on Steam but, it doesn't matter because the Steam fanboys hate Uplay which, means, according to the fanboys, that Anno 2070 is a bad game.

												I love playing this game. However, there's a very big problem with trying to play it. Shortly after acquiring the game, I got a new graphics card so I could attempt to run this on max graphics. However, I didn't realize that a ""SolidShield"" function would block me from playing the game. In addition to this, the game likes to crash. In my 70 odd hours of playing, the most I could play consecutively was maybe an hour and a half to two hours. My 70 hour campaign looks like a 40 hour campaign because of all the time I lost from crashing.There's one other outstanding problem with this game - the online play is awful.Back when I bought this game (quite a while ago), when you invited your friends (lets say you're inviting 3), only 1 could get in and the other two would error out and not be able to join. The chances of getting all 3 players in were very slim, and if you wanted to save and come back to the game later, you'd have to go through the cumbersome process all over again.There is an online DRM for this game that many seem to complain about, and I don't blame them. Having a game, specifically this one where you're in it for hours not interacting with others, is redundant. Ubisoft's stance on piracy and their expensive games have lead to this online DRM for practically every one of their games nowadays. If Ubisoft fixes crashing bugs and if you don't upgrade your computer hardware while wanting to play this game, I'd recommend it. Unfortunetly, the bugs have been present for a long while and I doubt they'll be fixed, so I'm inclined to write this game a nevative review.			",71,5,0,13,13,1,14

												Game itself is great and certainly worth playing once you own it. It's some classic Anno gameplay, so if you liked any of the previous one, you'll be fine with 2070.Now, I can't recommend buying this game. Ubisoft is a piece of s*** developper that took a great game and wrapped it up with as many layers of useless 3rd party apps as they could:- Installing the game will make you go through a ton of launchers and various stuff when Steam is all about streamlined installs- It will install Uplay and who knows what else to your machine (and launch it every time you launch the game)- TAGES DRM might prevent you from playing the game in a few years if you change your computer a few times (game will self destroy after you change computer 3 times)- You have to be online at all times to experience the full solo gameplay- Did I mention it's launching Uplay everytime you want to play the game? :(			",620,182,28,84,82,6,120

												A ""MEH"" Comment, not a no.I'll keep it short.The game itself is sublime, with the mods like AARC etc it becomes even better, probably the best anno game ever. You get to have the best parts of city building and RTS combat, with AERIAL, SUBNAUTIC, and NAVAL choices in same time. Get to nuke cities, capture them. Build dams and wonders. I've about 160 hour in this game, I would have more....UNLESS, this Ubisoft launcher wasn't an issue. I'll tell what ubisoft, as a company; they make very appealing games, I will give them that. BUT the problem starts, when they actually start selling it. They spam DLC like there is no turn backs, and release NO single fixes for the ingame bugs. Letting community find fixarounds. Which is extremely painful. As techical support and community support, Ubisoft the worst, unethical, disgraceful company I've ever witnessed. (after EA ofcourse). The game used to work on my computer, but now the ubisoft launcher doesn't even work anymore, doesn't update, crash all the time, no fix by ubisoft, no communication from ubisoft.MAKE GAME -> SHOW POLISHED SCREENSHOTS -> RELEASE GAME -> LET THEM GET BAITED -> BE SILENT TO THE COMMUNITY RAGE ABOUT BUGS -> RELEASE DLC TO SHUT THEM UP -> ABANDON GAME -> MAKE SEQUEL WITH %150 MORE PRICE.That is ubisoft for you. Anno 2070 used to work just fine before they released 2250. Now it's not working, probably they sabotaged the ubilauncher for 2070 just because they want to force people to buy 2250. I was really happy when I heard first about 2250, I was about to buy it from prepurchase, but the price seemed off. So miracalously I waited for review and ingame videos. It was a disaster, they took great anno series and put a retard city sim simulator with pathetic combat in different zone. I hate ubisoft, I hate them.

If you get the game on Steam, download uplay again from the dedicated website, otherwise you won't get anywhere. Since doing that, uplay hasn't affected the game since.

												It seems that most people not recommending this game are actually doing so on the basis of its 4th Party DRM; while archaic and utterly infuriating, being that Steam is already 3rd Party DRM, it does not reflect on the game itself.Anno 2070 is a beautiful open world city-building game with many different strategy aspects intertwined. Think of it like a far more advanced, far more stable, version of Sim City, with missions, singleplayer, NPCs, combat, and trading. Not to mention underwater city building.You can choose from 2 factions in game - An ecologist faction and a trade faction, each one with its advantages and disadvantages. As the environment plays a fairly key role in the game, your decisions as to how your islands develop and the pollution they produce can seriously affect end-game production, as more and more buildings are required to cope with the diminished returns of crops and livestock. However, pollution is necessary for supplies and income to be produced en masse; you, the player, must decide on how you choose to build up your city(s)Anno 2070's soundtrack is nice, without being too overbearing; it's certainly more mellow than other games, but for good reason. It's a nice listen, and I never play the game with music set to off.The game's graphics still look beautiful, even for a game that is 2 years old. The lighting and shadow effects are phenomenal, with water rendering that doesn't much detract from my FPS. What isn't shown in the screenshots is the underwater portions of the game, in that you can build supply depots and other research facilities under the sea. I strongly suggest if you're interested in that sort of thing you look up a video on it, it's rather amazing.Overall, the game is fun, very fun, enough to warrant a solid 8.5/10 from me; its seemingly laidback start to any game belies a hidden undertone of complexity not seen in most city building games such as this one.

												I really can't recomend this anymore. I have had horrible issues with Uplay. Now you can't play the game on mutiplayer without portforwarding, this make mutiplayer to the average steam user  virtually impossible to acess, and this is what this game is really good at: playing with friends, I ahve made a lot of good memories with this game. However it does not fare too well in single player, after several games you memorize the AI patterns and you just really need a person to play with you, but now you have to do portforwarding♥♥♥♥♥♥ other than that it's a wonderful game!

												Anno 2070 has given me both the best and the all time worst gaming experience in my life.  When I was able to play it, I enjoyed it very much.  There were so many ways to play it, so many objectives to achieve, scenarios to conquer, places to explore.  Even though I spent quite a few hours on it, there was still much to see, still so much of the game I had yet to play.  I was so disappointed when the Uplay catastrophe struck!  I could not believe they were not fixing the problem.  I don't understand why any company would knowingly abandon so many of it's paying customers.  ???  I was excited at first when Anno 2205 came out!  However, upon further reflection, I decided against purchasing it.  How can I take that risk when Ubisoft may also abandon it as well somewhere down the road?  No, I will stay away from this company's products.  I simply cannot put my trust in them again.  It's been a difficult lesson, but I've learned it well.  Sad and Disillusioned.... That about sums it up.			",27,6,0,3,14,0,9

Having only just recently decided to return to playing it, Uplay decide to♥♥♥♥♥♥it all up for me. The game has refused countless times to even open up for me. I have never had much of a problem with Uplay (until now) and having tried every solution in the big wide world web, sadly nothing has help. I'd love to recommend this game to anyone who like Anno however Uplay is involed.

												Now I fully understand that the issues with the game have nothing to do with Steam and everything to do with the Uplay launcher, but I would advise against purchasing this game due to the insane and inane issues with Uplay. I have contacted their supposed support on seven occasions and have never heard back, not even a courtesy automated response stating that my submission was even received at all. The two times I ever got the Uplay launcher to actually open without popping up its unexplained error the game would not launch at all, no error message, nothing. Again I don’t blame Steam at all really seeing as how they have no power over Uplay whatsoever. On a quick closing note I cannot play any games that require Uplay to launch, they all state that my CD keys have been used and prompt me to pay again, they need to fire the people responsible for making such an atrocity of a launcher.

												I simply can't recommend this game as good as it is. Not only does it have Uplay (sorry, I just can't support a society of DRM anymore. it's completely useless) but it also has a 3 system activation limit. Meaning? Don't rebuild your computer, ever, or else you are wasting an activation. And if you use all your activations? Guess you're buying another copy of the game.The game? 8/10. It's fun.The experience? 1/10 : UplayHow do you play this game without uplay? You don't. Don't buy it. Honestly whatever enjoyment you would have gotten isn't worth buying a game that isn't yours after 3 activations, and the frustrations of the Uplay DRM. The game isn't THAT fun to recommend playing and dealing with the hassles.			",288,33,0,53,69,0,56

I do not recommend this game due to the fact that it is completely unplayable and has been so for over 2 years.I contacted customer support a few times now.  Every time they are very friendly and professional and have helped me with a number of issues successfully.  But they are unable to fix this connection error, and are unable to explain it.Darn Ubisoft. :( great games, helpful staff...terrible service. uplay is just abysmal.UPDATE 3 Feb 2017:I built a new rig and installed a fresh new copy of Windows 10. Installed and updated OS and all hardware drivers, then installed UPLAY before anything else. Tried downloading Anno 2070 and because the key is linked to steam UPLAY forced me to install Steam to play the game...duh.Well, I got the same error. ""Connection to Server was lost"". I'm going to call Ubisoft and see if they will revoke my Steam Key in exchange for one through UPLAY to see if this fixes my issues.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Uplay is no-playThis sums up my review in a nut-shell. No matter how great this game may be, it does not justify the hassles and potential problems one may find in using Uplay.Took me 6 hrs to download the game from steam only to get an estimate of 21 hrs + through Uplay. Though it should be noted steam was downloading only 3 Gigs and Uplay 4.5 Gigs, a shocking difference I know. I would assume this is due to the limited sources Uplay comes from for as I monitor my network activity, steam is maintaining many more connections and images from DIFFERENT LOCATIONS.Uplay is annoying as hell and doesn't belong on steam. Steam SHOULD be thouroughly warning its customers when they need to go through a steam-knock-off server/client. To avoid doing so is a direct conflict of customer satisfaction.			",24,3,0,9,6,0,9

												After seeing this game drop in price I decided to pick it up mainly because I enjoy civ/city building games.  All of the screenshots looked good and I was really looking forward to playing this after several months on my wish list.However, first it runs a secondary program as a type of updater/DRM that for some reason reset my WMPlayer and I had to re-confirm my players settings. Really not cool since a few codex came up missing.  Secondly you need a account with ubisoft before you play.  I never got to play as I'm a firm believer that if I purchase a game here on Steam, I expect to download and play.  Not take part in secondary registrations and e-mail gathering.  After discovering this, I noticed the small “Requires a UPlay account"" at the very bottom.  This needs to be stated more clearly on the games you provide Steam.If this does not bother you then by all means pick it up, as for me this will be the last time I get anything from Ubisoft.***FYI the Ubisoft Game Launcher DOES NOT uninstall after removing the game on Steam.  You have to use your control panel to do so.***			",127,16,1,39,14,0,36

												Anno2070 is an economic game with Tier based progress system and basic elements of combat.The game has decent Video, Music and Interface settings. At highest settings with ""i5-2500K @ 3.30GHz"", ""GeForce GTX 560 Ti"" on 1920x1080 I have significant frame rate drop, but nothing unplayable. At just high settings it looks fine and works excellent.You have key bindings for the most useful actions, but any nondefault settings are stored on server, which means you have to reconfigure them for each offline session.Game launches via Uplay client. It is weird to see 2 game clients while playing Anno2070.The story is about the future with rised level of sea. The gameplay is based around island colonization (including underwater plateaus), building cities and product chains.You have 3 playable factions: Tycoons (or Global Trust - industrial conglomerate), Eco ( or Edem Initiative - global environment organisation) and Tech (or S.A.A.T - faction of scientists). There are third parties you may interact with during missions. There are aggresive parties, parties that are good for trade relationship, some may colonize islands. You may declare a war or do thier quests and gain reputation which gives access to different functions.Ingame progress is usually the next one: setup Tier1 residences, goods and construstion material production; evolve to Tier2, setup Tier2 residences, goods and construstion material production and so on till Tier4. The difficulty rises with Tier progression because productions may require resources from different islands, you have to extend productions of previous Tiers and do not forget to upgrade residences, and everything requiers certain mount of construction materials at certain place. AFAIK there is no way to tell how much goods does population need and how much production you should build in order to support it. There is no even ingame indication how much ihabitances, let say, Tea plantation may support. You have to use some wiki information and demand calculator for it.Even so it seems very tence, at practis it takes a huge amount of time to reach late state of the game. Pure rush to Tier4 can take 1-1.5 hours.Tech faction has interesting ability to research stuff (surprise!). It can give you items to boost production, extend raw matherial deposits, upgrades for your Ark etc.Ark is basically your cross-mission storage for goods and upgrades which is available from the beginning of the mission. In some situations Ark functionality is partially unavailable.There are natural disasters like Acid rains and Tornados. The last one can be very devastating. Your Nuclear Power Station can even explode and cause Nuclear Fallout if you are not careful.The Combat system is presented by ships, aircrafts and submarines with their strengths and weaknesses. For the late game there are also nuclear missiles and power shields available.The game also offers achievement system and Career progress with some unlocks like titles, skins for your avatar, Ark, some useful buildings and researches for Ark upgrade.There are daily quests and World Events to help your Career progress. World Event offers new Easy, Medium and Hard missions chain with unlocks that depends on type of Event.The game has Campaign, Continous mission, Single Missions and Domination mode.- Campaign is basically a big tutorial, has generic plot with its silly moments, but is ok, gives you a feeling of being involved in saving the world... again ;)- Continous mission is a mission created by player with wide variety of customization like third parties, amount of resources, win conditions etc. You may also make it as multiplayer by inviting people.- Single Missions are basically predefined Continous missions. Some of them can bring a real challange like ""Power Games"", so if you beat it you are somewhat prepared for the Domination mode.- Domination mode is where currently all peolpe are playing. It is a passive team multiplayer. You have map with different missions. Domination conflict has its length and time limit per day. If you don't spend all your day limit, it will transfer to the next day. You compete in achieving scores with specific goals like achieve Balance value, energy production, trade balance etc. You cannot meet neither your competitor nor teammate directly in mission. Once you get more scores than your opponent, you dominate mission and receive bonus scores. The winner is a team with the most scores at the end of conflict.The problem with this mode is that most conflicts have 12 hours/day setting and usually the winner is not the skilled one but the one who spent the most its time. Also there is some domination rating, which AFAIK affects nothing. So unless you play versus skilled players (which are usually attracted by 1 hour/day setting) purely for fun, it quickly becomes boring.The music is awesome! For 200+ hours of gaming I didn't get bored. It is very thematic and atmospheric.Anno 2070 has fair Business model which does not break game balance. It offers bonus contents which otherwise are available by compliting specific World Event or getting specific achievement.If you like complex economy management, sick multitasking, strategic planing and step-by-step growth with Tier unlock, this is definitely for you. If you find yourself in situation when game says you ""Dude, you have been playing for 6 hours! Stop it!"", then you know this is your game!			",16,3,0,3,5,0,1

												I've played all previous Anno games and I've loved them all. It is a great game to relax at due to its slow nature. You can even turn off military actions within your skirmish game so you can focus on building up your city and anything you want. You can take as many islands as you wish and build a city and production on every one of them. Eventually you can get to build underwater production which is an exciting addition to the game and a wonderful idea. Even after multiple hours of game time you can't actually finish building everything because there is simply so much to do and build. An other great improvement is the graphics that looks stunning and therefore screenshots and videos from it are beautiful.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this game a couple of years ago, and I still can't play it, because Uplay doesn't work. When I went to get customer support, from Ubisoft, I wasted about an hour trying to find and then get their customer support to work, only to get the following response:*""We're having intermittent server problems...""*""Keep trying...""*""Sorry for any inconvenience...""I kept trying and it still hasn't worked. So, I can only imagine they mistook the word ""intermittent"" for ""permanent."" Uplay is both broken and redundant, yet it's mandatory to play the game. Why? Why do I need this? I can't even login on offline mode because I need to sign in, at least once, but the server is always down.I paid about £30, for a game I am completely unable to play, because of broken DRM.

												Pretty clear the Ubisoft no longer supports the game as I have gotten no help in solving my activation key issue. Uplay and the Game ask for the Key twice, when entering it again, it says it's invalid. I am not able to play the game at all.When I COULD play the game, I had a lot of fun and would have given it an easy recommendation. At this point, I would turn most people away simply because the maker is Ubisoft.			",35,5,0,11,11,0,16

												I only have 3 words to say :Don't Buy It.Even if it was thrown to you as a gift, don't use it, stay away like it's an infectious plague.Now, here is the reason why :I will not extend myself on the game, as it is probably nicier and more fun than I could even imagine. And it pain me that I could not play it.BUT to play this game you have to install UPLAY and bend over to what ever decision Ubisoft make. And don't get me wrong. I don't mind a 'nicely done DRM that treat the customer right'. But I don't support DRM done wrong that consider every single buyer to be 'potential pirate'.The fact that Ubisoft want every of their players connected constantly is only the proof they are completely out of their mind. They have imposed real bad DRM over the years (the destructive Starforce for example) and they have pushed the whole system over the edge.Mixing a limit of 3 activation for a game, with the need to be constantly online is just.... how to say.... feeling like I need to pee in the check tube every time I connect to my computer and have the police of the town authorizing me to move around with an electronic bracer and a tailing car. To emphasis this, when I added the game in my wishlist, the page was not 'clearly' indicating the 3rd party and 3 activation limits.But when a friend offered the game to me, for my birthday, I first though ""nice, will finally try it"", before finding out it was asking for Uplay.Having had my share of problem with Uplay with Assassin's Creed (preventing me from playing through the first, and even killing any desire I could have to try to play to the second and 3rd that I bought), I felt forced to install it nonetheless as it was a 'gift'. Don't take the 2 and half hours as an indication about my play time. As in fact it took me over an hour just to have uplay working. And once I had finally all that thing working, I ended up trying the game, and was in fact starting to 'enjoy' it when suddenly I was kicked of the game and lost my whole progress without any more information than ""You lost connection to the uplay server"".So, if Ubisoft want to screw us over with their DRM, please don't give them any money. The only way to show them the light, is to vote with your wallet.Exert your right to put bad companies out of buisness with your wallet.			",140,21,1,21,45,2,63

Once you try starting the game with your new DRM it will fail to load.You might be able to jerry rig the game to work some how. If you feel like spending 4 hours talking to Ubisoft tech support you may be able to make the game work properly.The best part is...... Steam doesn't provide refunds for games you have played. Which means when you start the game... and the game doesn't load........ That means you have played it........Which means Ubisoft literally stole 40 bucks of your money.LITERALLY STOLE YOUR MONEY.

Posted: September 4, 2016
												I really don't get why so many people seem to hate Anno 2070. I really don't. And trust me, my play-time here on steam is nowhere NEAR accurately representative of how much time I've ACTUALLY spent playing it, so I've had more than enough time to explore this game.Anyway... as I was saying. I won't go so far as to say that Anno 2070 is perfect, but frankly, it does a lot of things so göddämn right that I can't help but wonder just WHY people hate it so much. I guess, and this really is petty even by MY standards, it's because you need Uplay to play it. A very VERY small price to pay in my opinion, since you already bought it on steam, now didn't you, ya daft bastärd?! Or maybe you didn't. I dunno. Either way...Graphics-wise, the game may be similar to 1404, its predecessor, but aside from a few VERY shallow similarities, that's the only things they really have in common. Let's first take a look at the resource system. In 1404, it was REALLY arbitrary and kinda silly how resources worked. For starters, how the flippety fûck-balls on shït-toast does it make ANY kinda sense that you can replenish a copper mine by paying money? And I'm not talking about some roundabout thing either. You literally just click on the mine, click a ""replenish"" button or something, and PRESTO!! Mine's full of shït to extract.Nah, in 2070, it's a bit more sensically designed. If your island is running low on copper, you get a laboratory to hook you up with a drill-thing-item-gadget-thing which digs the mine(s) deeper and thusly uncovers new deposits of that brownish stuff. Which makes a whole lotta more sense than just throwing an arbitrary sum of money down your mineshaft which then MAGICALLY transforms into clusters of copper ore.But I digress... the game's been upgraded in terms of, well, pretty much everything, really. Instead of there being only two playable factions like in 1404, there are now THREE playable factions!! Okay, so that's maybe not that huge of a change, but since the Orientals in 1404 were barely more than a vestigial ""resource outpost"" type thing, I'd say the change is a bit more than just a cosmetic upgrade.The very well-established contrast between the factions makes for an interesting setup as well. Will you play as the E.I., or Eden Initiative, a bunch of tree-hugging hippies, which're also eco-terrorists with a penchant for mischief ""in the name of mother earth""? Or will you favour the hard-hitting, fast-talking, no-nonsense G.T., or Global Trust, a heartlessly huge and hugely heartless mega-corporation, for whom pure profits outweigh all else?Joining these two morally ambiguous groups of lunatics are the S.A.A.T., a faction comprised almost entirely of engineers, scientists and other ""scholarly types"" of varying backgrounds. But they're depicted as a sort of aloof, ""science above all"" bunch of technocrats, who'd forego both a positive eco-balance AND a positive bank-balance if it meant they'd get their hands on some sweet new tech.So with all that in mind, the game is WAY less ""black & white"", what with all the morally questionable characters in it. And on that note, there are WAY more NPC dudes (and dudettes) in 2070 as well! Trenchcoat is my personal favourite; a sort of shady black market dealer who's refurbished an old aircraft carrier to use for shipping and dealing his questionable merchandise. Fun guy.Which reminds me of something that I REALLY appreciate about 2070 compared to 1404. Now, as those of you who've played 1404 knows, you could customize your flag/crest/emblem/whateveryacallit, your player colour and your portrait in the game, but these things were all acquired by buying them with some arbitrary bullshït ""gems"" you got for achieving stuff in the game. ""Plant 100 flowerbeds!"" and get 10 stinkin' gems. Nevermind the fact that you needed 200 or so of the fûckin' things to get a new portrait!Anyway, back on topic. In 2070, ALL customization items are unlocked by doing specific achievements; some easy, some hard, and some bloody fûckin' impossible. But that only made their associated unlocks all the sweeter! If you could dïck around and do a whole bunch-a easy-peasy-lemon-squeezy achievements and scrounge together some gems or whatever to just BUY the Vadim Sokov portrait, it wouldn't be at all special. But no, in 2070, ya gotta EARN your stuff!Which I obviously like. Achievements are all fun 'n' such on their own, but I find them to be WAY more interesting and compelling to go for when you get some kinda REWARD for 'em.Oh yeah, and there's a political aspect in 2070 now. D'ya remember those things in 1404, those unlocks you could spend your Honour Points on to unlock some vague benefits per game? Well, now there's a different thing available: faction progression. By doing daily quests, voting, and partaking in events, you can gain points with the three major factions, E.I., G.T., and S.A.A.T., which in turn awards you with various cool stuff.These include (but are not limited to): player profile customization items, various tech unlocks, and new arks to use. Oh yeah, that's something new to the series: arks. They're this sorta... base-thingamajig, that you can use to store goods (if you're kinda thick, since things can't be used when in the ark's storage), and order emergency shipments of goods as well. Anything and everything stored within the ark will be available in other missions as well, so it's sorta like a mobile player storage bank thing.Furthermore, if your last command ship (basic military unit) gets destroyed, you can order a new one at your ark for a hefty sum of credits, but no resource cost. Another benefit that replaced the attainments in 1404 is the Ark Upgrades, which is a collection of various items which gives you small but powerful (and GLOBAL) power-ups/boosts, such as lower maintenance costs on ALL units in the sector, or higher productivity for ALL farms in the sector. There are even ones, incredibly powerful but also hard-as-hell to get, that makes your cities IMMUNE to disease, fire or even crime!But anyway... moving on. I honestly don't know if 1404 had a co-op mode for multiplayer games, but if it didn't, then that's also an awesome new feature in 2070. How it works is that you actually DO NOT play as a faction each and then co-operate, each player controlling their own team, but rather that you and 1 (or more) other player(s) share control over the same team in the game. Needless to say, this is awesome for when you wanna teach your newbie friend how to NOT ♥♥♥♥♥ up in the game, without having to stand around behind 'em the whole damn time, pointing at the screen like you're trying to teach your 89 year old grandma how to do even basic computer stuff. Stupid old people.Where was I... oh, right. Yeah. Multiplayer! You can play with up to 8 distinct players/teams/factions/whateveryacallit in multiplayer now, so it can get pretty damn hectic if you let it, and with the added benefit of co-op, you can have 2-3 newbie players teaming up against 1 seasoned veteran without unbalancing the game too much, units-wise.Anyway, I think I'll be done rambling now, but if you're one of those lazy shïtwads who can't read, what... 12 lousy li'l paragraphs of text? Well then, fûck you and your laziness! That said, aside from Uplay, there is no reason WHATSOEVER not to give Anno 2070 a try. It's cheap, it's fun, it's moderately addictive, it's highly replayable and it's definitely worth a measly ten bucks/euros/whatever barbarian currencies are used elsewhere. 8.8/10			",256,39,2,25,30,0,45

												I purchased this game in 2011. I have never been able to launch it (I can get into the main menu). I have tried numerous times in five years. Ubisoft DRM stops me everytime. You can see I have 3.5 hours of time in-game. That's time spent attempting to connect to Ubisoft's servers, and also time the game (at the main menu) has been minimized while I've been troubleshooting. Nothing. Numerous support tickets over the years have not even yielded a single response. I have one open now that's been unanswered for a few hours shy of a week. Worse, I am not an exception to these issues. 62% of ~7000 reviews are positive, and quickly scanning the negative reviews shows that a large number of paying customers share this problem. That's at least 2500 customers that Ubisoft has basically written off over the years, and it doesn't even include the customers who don't own the game on Steam or haven't given it a thumbs up/thumbs down. That's bad. I wouldn't chance this if I were you.Edit: For anyone that's curious, after ten days I finally received a response from Ubisoft support. I was told I need to activate the game on Steam. In fairness, I'm not sure I made it perfectly clear in the support ticket that the game is installed on Steam, so I messaged them back. We'll see where it goes. It is worth noting I think the ticket classification which is essentially ""key is already in use"" corresponds with an error message you get in-game that tells you all the same. This is why I didn't specify in the ticket, as I thought it was obvious. If I was having an issue activating a game on Steam, I certainly would be contacting Steam. Ubisoft's prescribed steps don't even seem to work, as the Steam Product Activator doesn't recognize the CD key string as a valid string. Indeed, given the sheer number of reviews complaining about having the exact same problem I am having, you'd think Ubisoft would... well...			",101,17,1,20,40,0,34

												With regards to the negative comments, I have to say that as of the posting of this review, I have not experienced any flaws on behalf of either side (Valve or Ubisoft) in terms of both the game itself, or 3rd party sites (like Uplay). The game itself  is a lot of fun to play, and well optimized for PC systems. The graphic qualities and option of both continous free-play and linear story grasp my attention in a very positive manner. Therefore I highly recommend this game. I hope this review was of any help to the fellow gaming enthusiast looking into buying this game for themselves. I have to add, that many do not realize that the game has a third party policy that forces the buyer to buy the game every 3 new machines the game/steam account is launched off of. Be sure to keep that in mind when deciding to buy this game.			",81,4,3,7,12,1,7

												Anno 2070 is a complex game it takes a RTS (real time strategy) to a new level.  But if you love building cities, having limited resources, and limited land this game is for you.  Took me more then a few restarts to get a feel for this game but its so beautiful when it all comes together.  Its all about making do with what your granted and balancing it with the environment, and keeping your citizens happy with supply and demand so they can improve so you can improve.   Also lets not forget about the trade because that island next you more then likely has something you want be it rice, sugar, oil you get the idea.  This game is a must for any true die hard RTS gamer or even the casual RTS gamer but don't get your panties in a bunch cause you fail.  You need patience and understanding and the willingness to scrap your game and start over to achieve greatness in this game.			",57,2,8,14,5,0,19

												Sad sad Ubisoft. Don't get me wrong, this is a beautiful, extensive, and immersive game. It is an above ground and underwater city builder with complex city management and trade.  HOWEVER, UPlay is a horrendous gaming network and a DRM of 3 installs is appalling (to say it kindly). When I discovered I could only install this on 3 machines I was quite disappointed. Ubisoft support also seems seriously lacking. My son recently made purchase of a hardcopy ubisoft title, registered it to his account but could not download it - was just stuck in a registration loop. He was outright ignored by Ubisoft/Uplay official support contact - even after posting for help on their Facebook page. Eventually he exchanged the game for something worth twice as much (and not needing Uplay). So he posted again to their facebook to let them know he didnt want their assistance anymore because they are useless and he had solved his problem. Within minutes they deleted his post from the page making us well aware that Uplay had seen his original help request but they had deliberately ignored it.I'd hate to see what will happen when I have to contact them for a new key for Anno when I next upgrade my machine. If the same DRM restrictions exist for the new Anno when it is released I simply wont be buying it ... ever. In fact my experience with the few Uplay games I do own has taught me to be extremely wary of investing in any Ubisoft games again.			",48,19,0,7,12,0,7

Why Ubisoft decided to make you install Uplay then update the game through them and not Steam is a mystery and a pretty poor decision and means I won't pick up another Ubisoft title unless they stop forcing their Uplay service on me.

												I have bought this game here, on steam, didn't i?So, how could it install an upaly client on my computer without my permission, and ask me to register an account on uplay site when i just want to play the single-player part?!And then, when i have done all of this and get logged into it, the uplay client kept updating and verifying and restarting the game and itself again and again and again and again and again and again till i feel fed up with it!In addition, the connection to the uplay site seems not stable at all, i have failed to connect to it several times! I feel so glad to get my fund back!			",10,12,0,2,6,0,6

												Most of the negative reviews are for the uplay, not the game itself.So if you are not having any issue with uplay, just ignore it.The game itself is actually pretty good and looks beautiful.A rather complex city builder game with lots of things to handle/manage: economy, military, technology, and a little bit of diplomacy.IMO the main asset of the game is its economy, how you handle your goods, production, trade between island, your city/island planning.Creating a whole chain of production and how to distribute it.In a nutshell it's like logictic simulator.There are a 2 big factions that approach things differently, so you have to choose where you gonna start. One is ""go green"" kind of people and the other is ""max productivity"" kind people, each got its own advantages.And 1 more faction to expand your tech (science faction), both previous faction will gain access to this in mid game.----The campaign mission is doing a poor job at explaining the game and make it looks like a bad city builder game for starter.At first I drop this game because of the mission.But after trying to go on the skrimish/free sandbox mode, I change my mind.After you begin to understand how the game works, it's getting better and better.And afterward playing the missions are becoming a lot more fun to do, it gives you challenges and objectives.There are world events & world leader vote too. Not too important, but definitely add value to the game.----I'll recommend this game to those who love city builder games which have goods production in it, like caesar, civcity rome, banished, etc.I won't reccomend this if you only like city builder games which only have public services building in it, like simcity, cities skylines, etc.			",80,18,2,8,13,0,29

												I bought Anno 2070 only on sale despite all the negative reviews about Uplay and activations. I was hoping the issues wouldn't apply to me. Welp, after having to install Uplay, physically activating the product key (first Steam game I've ever had to do this for), and launching the game, I still have to be actively connected to Anno's servers to even play. And of course I got a ""connection to server is lost"" message so the game stays in an endless ""Logging in..."" loop.So anyone on the fence about this game, I do not recommend the hassle at all. It looks pretty, looks fun, but there's way too much DRM to even bother. If the servers go down you're screwed. I bought this on sale a long time ago so I'm way past Steam's refund window, so I highly recommend that if you do purchase you should try to play right away just to see if the servers even work so you have an opportunity to get your money back.

Patch the game again! I'm not kidding it installs the game then goes into another patching loop. 4 hours after Steam said 100% and I'm still not playing the game, Horrible experience, Uplay is a terrible addition to the Steam experience.I wish I had known it was infected with the venerial disease that is Uplay before purchasing and I could have stayed away.I can not comment on the gameplay as I still have yet to even see the main menu.

												I am a long-time fan of the Anno series but avoided buying this version until yesterday, during the winter sale. Today I remembered why I avoided it: the DRM is so horrible it breaks while installing itself. Ubisoft makes some great games, but manages to find such novel ways to shoot themselves in the foot with their anti-piracy schemes that they practically beg you to  search for the pirated versions (which usually come up no more than a month after launch and with greater user experience).I'd definitely recommend the game, but it has one of the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ implementations of UPlay I've met (having played quite a number of Ubisoft games).

												The game is actually quite good, but Ubisoft insists on sodomizing you with Uplay and the worst DRM known to man before they'll actually allow you to play it. If you're not bothered by the possibility of Uplay hogging resources in the background, and possibly the servers being down entirely curtailing your ability to play, as well as the chance that you'll have to wait on hold with some customer service line to get Ubisoft to unlock the game for you; then by all means get the game because it's one of the best looking and ingeniously complex economy simulators I've ever played.

Awesome experience building up cities and (almost always) overextending and failing at logistical management with fairly unique factions each with their own strengths and weaknesses. I also thoroughly enjoy the ambience of the menu screen (which sounds weird unless you know what I'm talking about).Uplay can be annoying, but I've never really had any issues with it, and those that I have had, customer support was able to fix in 10 minutes or less. Disregard all the negative reviews of people too intolerant of Uplay and give it a try, especially if you can get it on sale. ",104,11,1,18,18,0,37

												This game is awful.  The first missions are all about entering CD Keys, installing software you don't need or want, repeatedly picking usernames and profile names for accounts you don't want, and downloading all s from atrociously slow servers.  Regardless of whatever else this game may have to offer, the atrocious DRM and terrible launcher and update mechanics are reason enough not to buy it.  I already regret this purchase.  I normally try to avoid Ubisoft products where I can but failed to notice in time that this was one.When the game finally launches you will be pestered with surveys and pop-up advertisements.  Like visiting a porn site, but without ... well, any of the reasons you'd visit a porn site.  Tab out to note this for your review and the game will crash, revealing another advertisement in the launcher.  Wow.			",87,27,2,15,19,1,13

You think that is all? No! After you log in the game you have to:- insert your key again, now for the Uplay- download more updates of the game- reboot the game- more some kind of updatesAfter that they will make a proposition on a large banner for you to play Anno Online (even they have to understand you are playing it the first time).After all this crap, when I finally could be able to play, I just log out this ***** game.

												Thankfully I bought the game when it was on sale, a whole 7.49 for the entire game including all of the DLC, sounds like a good deal right?Well, I made the sad mistake of not looking at who had published the game....Ubisoft.Now, Ubisoft is a great company no doubt about that, but.... Uplay is the video game client equivalent to a tumour, it's ♥♥♥♥ing annoying, and its very hard to deal with. The setup for the game goes as follows1. Purchase game on steam2. Download game on steam, put in game key3. Open up Uplay, Groan because it's another loop to jump through, put in same game key4. Open game, Make account for the game, and cheer!(By now it has been at least 10 minutes, and you just want to play the freakin game)5. Continue cheering, and then freeze, because the game has closed and you need to download more of the game on Uplay in order to play, but the download starts as soon as you put in the game key for the third time.This is not an effeicent system what so ever, and i have no idea how they though this is good....Buy at your own risk, because this games set up takes way too long.P.s. DRM up the♥♥♥♥♥ just throwin that out there.			",168,43,0,24,9,2,7

												This game reminds me of Caeser, Pharoah, and the other economy-based city-builders of the 90's and early 2000's. I haven't played any other Anno games so I cannot comment on if this is a good or bad Anno game, but I've really enjoyed it. You have to build a city while managing a bunch of different resources, which are used to upgrade your city and advance up the technology chain. You can only get certain resources from some islands, so you need to either expand your empire or trade with other players. It's a little complex, and it can get very overwhelming in the late game when you are dealing with many islands and every resource, but it's really satisftying when everything clicks into place and you have a functioning chain of islands.The big downside is the Uplay DRM. It's actually problem-free for me, but I can't deny that it is utterly useless. It runs in the background for no real reason, and you need to sign up for a Uplay account. If you're lucky like I am, that's all the  interaction you'll need to do with Uplay. I know some people have an avalanche of problems, so your mileage may vary.Get the Deep Sea expansion, because it adds a whole new faction to the game and it feels incomplete without it.I'm not sure if the campaign really goes anywhere, and the bulk of the game seems to be based around the sandbox-esque continuous game mode. So, if you're looking for goals and missions, you might want to look elsewhere. If you like managing cities and supply lines, and micromanagement is your game, you'll probably have a great time here.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I have tried reaching UBIJUNK many times by opening a ticket and by email never recieved a replay after weeks of trying. I wish steam would drop UBIJUNK for good they are NOT needed steam is far better. I wasted my money with my purcheses. NEVER again!			",13,2,0,5,10,0,19

												This game is... ...surprisingly boring.At first it seems fresh, and is indeed very graphically capable for it's genre.  But then.... nothing.  It's just dry.  There's little drive or point, nothing to do, few resources to manage (and those there are seem wierdly forced and arbitrary-  like why is my city so obsessed with tea and hamburgers as our ONLY food resources?!)It's not that it does much wrong, it just doesn't do much at all.  One of the most boring games ever made for both the city-building genre and strategy especially.But hey, if you want a game you can completely master in ten minutes, go for it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I can't recommend this game in any way shape or form. That 2.1 hours of playtime? I haven't played a single minute. What I did do was spent 2.1 hours wrestling with UPlay, downloading updates for it, updates for the game itself, putting product keys into Uplay, putting product keys into the game, then being kicked out of the game to download the expansion pack, more Uplay connection issues and eventually when I managed to get into the game I get spammed with offers to play whatever ""free""-to-play garbage they're vomiting at me and asked to complete a product survey.This shouldn't be on Steam. Pretty much every other Steam game, regardless of the developer, integrates soundly, downloads DLC easily and doesn't require multiple logins to different services just to play the game. Just awful. I deeply regret purchasing this, and a copy for my wife so we could play multiplayer. I shudder to think of what horrors await those who would try to establish a multiplayer session. It probably requires Gamespy arcade or some other archaic nonsense.[Edit] Decided to try it again in July 2014 - this time Uplay decided it would crash when trying to login. I had to uninstall it, manually delete it since the files didn't actually uninstall, and then manually download and install Uplay from Ubisoft's website. That's another hour of my life I won't get back.			",987,240,41,150,103,7,140

												Great game, my favorite RTS ever actually, except Ubisoft proprietary DRM which is a real pain in the ***. Thus the huge play time recorded: I used to hibernate the PC with game running to shorten startup time.I was actually able to launch it recentely (dec 16), but it has been abandoned by developers (no more monthly campaign, which were one of the most challenging parts).As of now, I cannot recommend buying.Really a pity, I add.

												Anno 2070 is a hybrid resource management, city building sim and RTS by Ubisoft. Using futuristic technology, you must build a city to complete various goals while balancing the favor of three factions.The main campaign for Anno 2070 revolves around a rogue A.I. and the steps that you must take to protect your people while solving the puzzle of how to defeat it. The story is told through in game events as you complete quests, and through pre and post mission cutscenes. While story can be somewhat secondary in these types of games, I found it rather compelling and was definitely interested in what would happen next.For the campaign mode, you will be designing your city so that you can complete certain goals given to you by one of three factions, which are representative of business, technology and environment. Towards later missions you will be balancing the needs of multiple factions, whose unique buildings or abilities you will need to complete your quests. Since your city is persistent through multiple levels, this can create some issues while you are planning. You may spend one whole mission optimizing your city for the tech faction, only to find out later that you will need high level buildings from the business faction to continue. Your cities are mostly built on islands, and square footage is at a premium, so this can be problematic. Luckily for the most part there is not much of a penalty for having to tear down a building to place something new in its place, but still you can find yourself having spent hours designing a city perfectly just to find out later you have to tear it down.Game balance is done very well. You will need to provide your citizens with certain goods, depending on what faction they are from, and most of these goods can be manufactured in your buildings. You will need to balance your cash, power supply and ecobalance to complete each mission, and luckily there are generally ways to increase each if you are patient.Graphics are top notch, as our sound effects and voice acting. A lot of effort was put into the creation of this game, and it shows.After completing the main storyline, there is still plenty to accomplish. There are council votes which you can participate in, and will give you bonuses to certain factions. There are many scenarios to play through. The main story can take you upwards of 20 hours or more to complete, and if you still want more to do, more is available.Overall, I would completely recommend Anno 2070. It has that one more turn mentality that can keep you hooked for hours at a time. There is so much to do even after the main campaign that you will definitely get your money's worth. Anno 2070 is highly polished, well balanced, and very, very entertaining.Score: A-			",777,367,21,112,93,8,122

												Beautiful, Smooth, and Enjoyable. Unlike other strategy games like Civilization, Meridian: New World, Starcraft, etc, this game focues on more realistic ideals. Economy, Citizens, Resources, and the Environment are the main aspects. Now you may say that this game sounds like any other, but it focuses on these aspects greatly. You can't just build a mine on a resource and expect it to instantly be accessible and have the resource flowing to your city. Time el facto is one thing, it takes time for resources to go from point a to point b. Citizens have needs and there are different demographics for citizens. They level up as you fulfill there desires earning you more technology and resources. The economy is based on your tax income and expenses. Unit maintenance, citizen's needs, tax rates, and trade all affect tax income. The important part is the environment. Disasters, cities, units, and resources are affected by how polluted or clean the environment is. Great game, Co-op is good, everything is good.			",64,5,0,10,14,0,12

												Both the game as an entertainment piece and as a product should be reviewed and considered when deciding whether or not to give money to the people who made it.In this case, they will treat you like you are a thief by default with a broken 3rd party DRM. You can end up locked out of your game and having to go through to a customer support nightmare to prove you own this legitimately. Surprisingly, this is a problem a pirate will never have. Which begs the question: why did they put this DRM in the first place?The game is all right, but as with much of what they publish, not worth having to deal with Ubisoft.Overzealous publishers need to either remove their games from Steam to avoid two pieces of DRM conflicting or to remove theirs and trust Steam (which is light years ahead in my opinion).If you're really keen on this game I'd suggest getting it directly on Uplay or elsewhere.

												This is not a bad game if you can manage to launch it.When you install the game, do not launch it. If you do, uPlay will crash on start. Go to the uPlay site and create an account if you don't already have one. Add the game to your account from the uPlay web site. Download the uPlay launcher from the web site and install it on top of the one included in the Steam version. If you don't follow these steps, uPlay will repeatedly crash and you won't be able to play at all.The single player missions are tough and actually require strategy and a grasp of the economy. You will run out of money and you will try many different strategies to scrape together the cash you need to continue. This is essentially a city builder with a great deal of micromanagement, not a war game.As you progress, game elements and enhancements can be unlocked with points earned. An internal voting system exists for everyone playing through uPlay to elect factions which provide various buffs. Unfortunately, uPlay's internal achievements and points system don't allow for Steam cards or achievements.If you can get past the extremely frustrating nuisance that is uPlay and manage the steep learning curve, you will enjoy the game.

												I really wanted to get into this series of games, I've been watching a lot of YouTube tutorials/reviews because I like to be an informed buyer and know what I'm doing once it's started up. No where did I see anything that foreshadowed the hell I was about to endure. After buying and installing the game I was prompted to install a third party launcher called Uplay, alright that's fine, I've had to install these before so it's not much of an issue. After entering the CD key on Steam to activate the download I was asked to provide the key again for Uplay, okay cool. After launching the game I was ONCE AGAIN prompted to enter the key, however, there was a message. In the area where I was supposed to enter the key it said, ""No SolidShield."" This is where the issues begin. After entering my key for the THIRD TIME, I was told it was already in use by another Uplay member. I don't understand this, I'm logged into Steam, I'm logged into Uplay, both of them have the game activated using the key provided through steam but I still can't play?You'll see I have 4 hours on record, the entire 4 hours come from me troubleshooting. I never got past the login screen. I'm starting to hate how Ubisoft won't let me skip their logo, (I just wanna get to the log-in screen to verify that Ubisoft is trash and it won't let me play, cause let's face it, after 4 hours of forums and support pages, even a ticket to Ubisoft, it's not gonna work).Here's a list of everything I've tried from first to last, as best I can remember.> Running Anno 2070 from Steam.> Running Anno 2070 from Uplay.> Running Anno5.exe as Administrator.> Running Anno5.exe as Administrator in compatibility mode.> Running Uplay.exe as Administrator.Somewhere I read having the Uplay and SolidShield folders in Program Files will cause issues.> Reinstalled Anno 2070, Uplay and SolidShield to my Desktop.> Continued to get ""No SolidShield."" > Uninstalled and reinstalled SolidShield.> Continued to get ""No SolidShield.""> Uninstalled Anno 2070 from Steam and downloaded directly from Uplay.> Continued to get ""No SolidShield.""I've been all over the Steam forums, Ubisoft forums, even some lesser known forums, trying to find an answer. There are countless threads of people having the same issue, one customer I saw had been waiting over two weeks for a response to his ticket. Some customers aren't getting responses at all. Some people posted in 2015 and followed up late 2016 just to inform others that their game still doesn't work and they haven't found a fix.TL;DR - I'm envious of those who get to enjoy these games, they look amazing, but I will never make another purchase from Ubisoft. This is ridiculous, completely unprofessional. I'd expect this from an early access developer and wouldn't be angry, but this is a major international developer with studios in 18 different countries. Pathetic.			",23,4,0,3,1,0,4

												This is an excelent city builder style of game. You always play on a sea map where there are a bunch of islands which can be developed into somewhat independent cities each that can trade with each other.  The AI is also developing its own city-islands.   It is a lot of fun if you are into city builders. Here is a lets play that can give you an overview of game-play and does not contain spoilers:

												I don't know how to review Anno 2070.  The game isn't for everyone.  It's a complex logistics chain simulator, in essence.  The game focuses very little on 'city-building', in actuality.  The primary focus that consumes the game is production chain management.  You have limited space, and multiple islands, and you have to get raw resource A polished into finished good B, and then get B delivered to the particular population that is demanding the good.The game has many other elements, including building cities.   It has a lot of beautification and aesthetic items you can add.  It's the best of the Anno series I've played thus far.Essentially, if you like making a well-oiled machine and watching the beautiful results of said machine, you'll like this game.  If you don't like managing supply chains and trade routes, you won't like this game.I adore this game.			",156,33,0,23,12,0,33

												Be aware that all those warnings about Uplay and what a pain in the neck it is are 100% true.I've read them before buying this game, but unfortunately didn't think it could really be that bad and the others were just unlucky, so I bought the game anyway. Yeah, now I've spent 45 minutes trying to get the game to start, all the while installing this other software for uplay from Ubisoft and god knows what with it on my PC (it installed without asking, I love that!) and the game still refuses to let me start it. The best part so far was, when uplay was running, steam was running but the game itself was nowhere to be seen and then, when trying to start the game through steam (again) I get the error, that the game is already running. Uplay couldn't be exited 'cause a game was running, a game that didn't show up in my uplay account or the taskmanager. So only forcefully killing uplay and steam did the trick to at least get the game screen up again.I know, I'm not really talking about the gameplay here, but I think the experience with the set up is bad enough to warrant a review and warn others that this is is one of the worst installations I've come across in the last couple of years.If only I had believed the other reviewers, I would not have bought this game.

												The most annoying part of this game is dealing with UPlay. After downloading the game on steam, you download several unknown things in several different launcher type windows before being forced to download the UPlay launcher. You are then forced to create a Uplay account (in a desperate attempt by Ubisoft to make it more popular). If you manged this far, you will have entererd the game and entered your game key 2-3 times before the game quits itself and starts downloading something else again. By the end of this you finally make it into the game where numerous cut scenes repeat information. Anyone who has never played the game will experiance some difficulty as the game makes the controls very unclear. I would in no way recommend this game, it is wrapped in disappointment and frustration!			",112,12,0,6,15,2,7

												DO NOT BUY THIS!!  You cannot play this game, They have a third party program that makes you login and run the game, then once you login using that you have to activate your product, it won't let you because your key is a steam key and won't be recognized because it's on a ""legacy"" product. (any product made before 7-14-14).  I submitted a ticket and they told me that I typed the key incorrectly (copy and pasted it btw) and closed the ticket out.  Of course I can't refund because it was before the refund days.  Ubisoft refuses to beleive they have problems with U-Play, but it's seriously broken.			",174,32,10,81,83,3,109

												Ubisoft have completely ruined their games with Uplay DRM. If it actually works, it makes you jump through the most ridiculous hoops to play your game. steer clear of this game and all Ubisoft games. They are simply not worth the hassle of dealing with Uplay.Edit: A comment I made after the review that elaborates on some of the issues:Uplay updated recently and wanted me to download the game again after I have already downloaded it through steam. Uplay adds nothing to the game experience and is an intrusive nuisance. Good luck playing a Ubisoft game bought on a steam sale as it will require Uplay activation and their servers are so poorly resourced that you'll have to wait several days to play it. It's a terrible customer experience. It's easier to pirate the game than play a legitimately bought copy!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is top notch. One of my favorites. I was initially skeptical about buying this game due to the barrage of negative reviews regarding Uplay. But then, getting the complete edition in $2 is a steal for a game of this caliber. So I went ahead and bought the game. Although I was fearful that the DRM would screw this one for me, but to my delight nothing of this sort happened. The installation went smooth. No issues with Uplay launcher, CD-keys or anything for that matter. I suppose all you need is a really good internet connection so that everything goes uninterrupted. I agree that it took around 20-30 minutes to initialize the game at first run. But it was worth the wait and now I am running the game smooth as butter. For all the fans of city building games, this is definitely a must have. Notes :- I will explain how the installation went for me, for the reason it might help the first timers and also those who are facing issues.1. Downloaded and installed the game on Steam. Copied the CD-key for future use.2. Uplay took a while to download, logged in with my account.3. The game was not in my Uplay library. So instead of activating a key in Uplay, I simply ran the game from Steam. Now a popup appeared telling me that the game will be linked to this Uplay account.4. The autopatcher downloaded a lot of files, updating the game to the latest patch.5. Ran the game. A pop up appeared again with ""No SolidShield"" written in the box. I just erased the text and typed the CD key in the given format (xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx).6. Voila! The game is activated and good to go.			",11,0,0,2,0,0,2

												Hard to tell what I think about the game, because it's literally been an hour of uplay restarting itself and making new accounts and patching something new each time and asking for another key.If I'd realized how many hoops uplay was going to put on the game before being able to play it, I wouldn't have even spent the few bucks it cost in the winter sale.

												I'm starting this review off by saying that as a newcomer to the Anno series, I really enjoyed this game. The production chain building and shipping from island to island is well done and is quite fun. It also offers a surprising amount of replayability. Also unlike some other old Ubisoft titles (Endwar springs to mind) the serverside portion of the game (voting on events, timed missions, ect) is still running and offers a good shakeup. Its worth noting that I haven't tried the domination multiplayer gamemode, but it looks like it is very good. I unfortunatly can't comment on the graphics because every computer I've run this game on is a potatoe, but thats my problem.Onto what caused so many people to vote this game down, the DRM. I personally haven't had any trouble with it but I installed Uplay before hand because of other games, so I don't speak for the majority of the playerbase aparently. The elephant in the room, Tages, almost never caused me problems and when it did it was understandable. The only time I ran into an issue was when I was messing about with VM's and I only ran into the problem on the 5th VM try. All it took to fix it was talking to ubisoft support to get it sorted out, and I haven't had a problem since.All in all, near perfect game (the combat is very obviously not the focus of gameplay or design work) with a little bit of annoyance related to DRM, but nothing that even got me close to upset. I'd recomend this game at anything up to $45, as the amount of enjoyment you can get out of it is amazing.			",129,19,1,20,59,1,94

Due to the seriously stupid DRM bundled in with this game I have been unable to play since, apparently, it has de-activated my account but not freed up the CD-key for use. Basically, I cannot activate my game, therefore, I cannot play my game. You know… The one I spent money on.I have become sick of being treated by a criminal by publishers… I wonder how many pirates had this problem…What a waste. Perfectly good game ruined by ♥♥♥♥♥♥ practices.Edit: I managed to fix my issue after spending 2 weeks in uplay support. My previous opinion and comments still applies, Anno is a fantastic game, but the practacies by Ubisoft have utterly destroyed any hope to a positive recommendation.			",221,40,9,35,28,1,44

												Anno 2070 is very much like it's predecessors, however, the polished look and feel of the interface, nicely balanced units, and cross building between the various careers (factions), and coupled with that ever so slight appeal of future tech and possible future make it shine all on it's own.For those who don't know, the Anno series is a city builder / real-time strategy game, leaning a bit more heavily on the builder aspects. Managing the needs of your sector and cities within can sometimes be a juggling act in itself. If you're looking for the pace and speed of say Command & Conquer or Starcraft. This isn't for you. If liked those games, and also liked things like SimCity or other builders I think you'll enjoy this.The amazing emmersive soundtrack, and top notch voice work, splended visuals, and solid gameplay really add up to an enjoyable experience be it for a quick daily mission game or, whole evening dive into continuous play. With multiple game modes, multiplayer drop-in, world-events, user interactions through elections and making choses, advancing up your career ladder. The Anno 2070 is a game that could keep you busy for months.			",577,182,1,89,43,3,74

Complex, deep, everything you want.It looks great too, the animations for all the buildings are done really well and you can just sit looking at your creation for hours with a smile on your face.People who whine about UPlay are flat out incompetent. I've bought broken games before, this is far from broken. UPlay is not good, at all, but it's not even close to as described in these reviews. Don't let that scare you away from the game if you are interested.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of the most challenging, time consuming, and addicting games I have ever played. I have never had any ""Launch Issue"" or Ubisoft login issue. I have over 200 hours of gameplay invested in the Anno franchise and this is by far the best of the series. Recommend 10/10 times.			",23,0,0,7,1,0,2

												I am glad that I decided not to listen to the mass of childish reviews regarding the annoyance of Uplay and the loading times. I enjoy this game for the city building aspect set in a futuristic world.The graphics are good, however don't expect to fall in love with them unless you zoom all the way in.Controls and objectives were not clear initially, however after a few hours things make 'sense' for why the developers have made the game this way.Overall if people haven't bought this simply because of the loading, and they have a mere few hours to their names, please disregard them. Keep it on your wish list, and purchase when it is on sale - but purchase you should if you enjoy sim building experiences. ",12,4,1,6,6,0,10

												When there are so many great features in Anno 2070, why am I saying ""Not Recommended""? I'm a lover of older city builder / production chain games. Unfortunately in Anno 2070, the campaign got in my way: instead of having time to learn the ropes, experiment, and calculate building production, I was almost immediately forced into a time-critical deficit situation. For me, at least, it took out the parts I find fun about city builders. There are lots of other ways to play Anno 2070, so I imagine it will work better for other styles of play. Certainly, with the three types of economies, the multiplayer features, and the frequent ""event"" chapters, there is a lot to do. But for me, I found the introduction frustrating enough that it's been hard to enjoy any of the rest of it, even with 30 hours to get used to it.			",67,32,0,22,22,0,26

												As a general rule, I always turn my back on UPlay games knowing the fate that would befall me should I stray from that path.  Yet my love of Anno 1404 (Dawn of discovery) drove me to risk and dragged me to ruin.  The game itself, when Uplay graciously allows you to play it, is non-intuitive and the tutorial severely lacking, especially when it comes to new concepts for this itteration.  Having a deep background in complex games, I found even this one to be needlessly obtuse, and just generally not fun.If Uplay, then no one plays.			",112,25,0,24,21,1,53

												The reviews are NOT over-sensationalizing uPlay; it's the most needlessly complicated registration system out there that can prevent you from ever playing the game. I should know because I just got off the phone with Ubisoft customer support after being locked out of an account I tried to create. Not only does your account get banned, but you IP address will get banned so that you can't play the game, cannot log into your account for support or  cannot log-in to ubisoft for chat help or even see their 'help' section. I had to browse through steam forums to find a local number to call because the 888 (toll free) number I found on the forum redirects you to the support website (which doesn't work unless you log in.) It just says that 'You broke the internet.' Not very funny, Ubisoft.I had a u-play account, but I wasn't sure what password I used. Not only that, but I wasn't sure which of my emails I used. After my third attempt at the combo, everything became banned for a minimum of 2 hours to an alleged max of 24 hours. So don't plan anything around playing a game from ubiSoft.This is the first time I ever had to leave a review for a game I haven't had a chance to play. The antiquated system and poor planning that this company uses to prevent account phishing and pirating is helping no  one - not the consumers and NOT the company. It's alienating gamers and turning people off from playing their games. Read through other comments about U PLAY and please be advised that these are not just highly-dramatized gripes. People legitimately cannot get access through U Play. The customer support cannot unlock your account, help you register your new game or even tell you how long it will take before you are able to log in. And try to log in again too soon... BAM, block timer reset. 0 stars out of 100.			",29,30,0,31,53,0,16

												Ubisoft Uplay is required, and installs when you click ""play"" when the game is installed on steam. It then needs to update, requires you to boot the game in order for you to put your key in, then exits the game to update it. Massively sloppy game installation process. We should never have let EA get away with pushing Origin down our throats, now every game dev gets their own annoying app store which is required to play their games. It is not okay.

												The game still uses Uplay and maybe worse than that (ye I know I’m shocked there’s something worse than Uplay) is that 3 machine limit which is so dumb it’s not even like we can sell the game on its linked to our account now add into that that at some point this year I will be upgrading to a new rig that will be my 3rd and last install (last year I got a new SSD for my main drive).My advice is DO NOT BUY THIS GAME although it’s a great game and looks beautiful it has too bigger downside in the limited install.

												I was really impressed with my first impression... The single player campagin starts as the corporate tycoons exploiting the earths resources, you can see the beautiful environment slowly fade and erode into nothingness. An island that once was inhabited by deer and bears becomes barren and the beautiful seascape of whales and dolphins becomes empty... This is until the game introduces the environmentally friendly faction which attempts to establish a balance with nature, with a slower production rate, yet sustainable resource consumption rate. So far the game seems incredible, until they introduce the second campaign... there are so many random events with litttle to no explaination of solving them... such as poison fish, special build technologies, or most frustratingly telling you oil is available and buildable until a special event occurs. For a tutorial based campagin, all this game does, is confuse me... After roughly 10 hours I am confused and annoyed.			",29,5,1,4,8,0,11

												Deep and intricate city builder/supply chain manager game. The learning curve is a bit steep at first, but once you get the hang of it it'll be second nature.  I hadn't played it in almost a year and I came back to it with zero need for a refresher course.  It is fantastic, beautiful, relaxing, and once you know where everything is - intuitive.  As with any Ubisoft game it is tied to Uplay, but this is something I've learned to accept.  I had given this game a negative review long ago because of the Uplay attachment, but mostly because at the time it also had a limit of downloads, making it essentially a rental rather than a purchase.  Yesterday when I downloaded it again I saw no mention of this limit.  Kudos Uplay.  At it's regular price it is a steal, and I wholeheartedly recommend it if you are looking for an intricate builder/manager game with minimal combat [if you're playing outside of the campaign, combat becomes entirely optional].  Would definitely recommend looking up some tutorials on youtube though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't usually like to write reviews. When I write them, its hard to put my thoughts into words because my understanding of a game is almost always different than another person's understanding. Nonetheless, I need to write a review for Anno 2070 because i've spent enough time with this game to put my thoughts into words. TL;DR is at the bottom if you want it.I'll start with what most people consider the deal-breaker with Anno 2070, which is Ubisoft and their toadies Blue Byte and Related Design. Ubisoft, in their *infinite* knowledge, decided to shoehorn in their UPlay DRM for what seems to be no reason. In fact, all it does is break the game for some and make another hoop to jump through for others. Either way, its annoying. But reviews on Steam aren't gonna stop them, so I won't drag on about them.But I will drag on about Blue Byte and Related Design. If these guys weren't owned by Ubisoft, I can make a safe bet that if these guys were runned by a more consumer-friendly company, than we wouldn't see issues like losing integral parts of the game overtime or having to jump through hoops to get the game running. But the problem is that these developers are too afraid of telling Ubisoft to shove-it, so we end up with all these issues in their games. I know that both of these developers can produce very amazing games, but because they can't be self aware we end up with carcasses of games overtime.Enough about the people, let's get to the game. It is basically the mammoth of the Anno 2070 franchise. More factions, more AI competitors, more goods, more everything! This was my first Anno game, and although it was a little overwhelming at first, I got the hang of it after a while. This game is luckily very well polished, and has been updated overtime to make a better experience. The soundtrack, graphics, and mechanics are all top notch. I couldn't have asked for anything more. I'm not gonna get into the gameplay, but once you look on YouTube or you play the campaign it'll become easy to get the hang of. I do want to warn you though that certain features are just plain different from when the older videos were made or when the campaign was made. As of writing this review for the game I am in the works of creating an updated tutorial/let's play for anyone who wants to get into this game now. That may be available at some point.Let's just address some new things before I end this review. The DLC is certainly worth it, and expands the game so much you can't resist. It will make your life easier. However, the only DLC you may want is the Deep Ocean expansion. The rest is just little cosmetics or things that will be a minor benefactor in the end. As for the current state of the game, they removed the 'World Events' system, which is a little bit of a pain, but you'll probably still be okay. The best part of Anno 2070, in my opinion, is the experience building and nuturing a whole civilization. That won't ever be going away, so if you wish to share that experience, then this game is certainly for you.TL;DR: Although Ubisoft and their Toadies are a pain, the actual game is a breath-taking experience that will be a staple of the city builder for a long time.

												This has to be one of my favorite games of all time - I've played it every now and again for years now. Anno 2070 is a city builder/management game. The management game is stronger than the city builder, which is good because I prefer to look at graphs and optimize workflows rather than make traffic flow properly or design something pretty. But that's just me.The soundtrack is wonderful. I listen to it on my own periodically and I have for the past couple of years since I heard it for the first time. I would say that playing Anno 2070 is a thoroughly peaceful experience which tests the mind's puzzle solving and planning abilities rather than reflexes. But it's also really beautiful.It's like cities skylines with less traffic, or roller coaster tycoon with more management and less design. If you like games like those you'll probably like this one, too.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												DRM is a blight to the industry and all I hear from the devs or publishers is all the whining about pirates stealing the game (which is all propaganda) and I'm NOT sorry to say that any game that uses DRM pretty much won't get a sell out of me (excluding this one, of course). I tried to give drm a try, you know give the dev/pub a shot but it is too ridiculous. As a steam client I should not have to deal with this. The Whole selling point of steam is to put all your games in a convenient library only to have to agree AND sign in elsewhere and pass those hurddles... ugh. PASS! And now unfortunately this game just sits in my library and does nothing. Well, actually thats not true... it stands as a reminder to never buy anything from this dev/ publisher again. Because you know, there is always another dev or publisher to take their place. Graphics - 8/10Story - 9/10Gameplay - 9/10  subtract 10 for DRMFinal Score - 0/10			",27,1,0,4,2,0,4

												Haven't had much trouble with U-Play as everyone else. Works just fine for me. As for the game I finally just beat the campaign and it opens up a ton after the campaign. Its amazing if you would like a strategy game about trading and maintaining your populations happiness with food and other stuff like technology. massive chains of trade. economic strategy simulator. The quests in the campaign sometimes were not to clear as what i had to do which kind of annoyed me. Once i beat the campaign this game became pretty awesome rather than ok. So i would reccomend it and graphics and the detail of the enviroment and cities is really nice.			",795,247,17,80,108,8,137

												Though it might not be as visually charming as Anno 1404 (also known as Dawn of Discovery for some people), Anno 2070 is still lovely in its futuristic way. I've had a lot of fun playing this with my husband, both of us cooperatively building our ""empire"" together. The production chains are always fun to figure out, and trying to get things running as efficiently and effectively as possible is very satisfying. It's one of those games where you think to yourself, ""ok, I'm going to play this for 10 more minutes"" and then look up and realize that was 2 hours ago. Having to go through Uplay is a bit of an inconvenience, but I don't let that detract from the fun of the game.			",113,36,2,28,14,2,30

												Why this game is♥♥♥♥♥♥1. Forced uplay (ubisoft store) account setup is♥♥♥♥♥♥and I don't want it. I'll take steam thank you. 2. Buggy as all hell. Trying to get through the tutorial and I just keep getting stuck because the game glitched out so I can't finish the quest. Had this happen twice and had to reload the mission and replay it to beat it. Found many other minor bugs aswell. Just look this up others are having problems too with bugs.  3. Complicated and lack of tutorials. At many times you will have no ♥♥♥♥ing clue what your doing or what half of the♥♥♥♥♥♥even means that is on the screen. The game does nothing to teach you the basics. I had to go watch someones youtube video to find out what they are. Which was another 1-2hours of watching a video of how to play.  4. Don't buy/avoid this.			",38,6,0,3,6,0,3

												Annoying and unintuitive.Launching the game launches Ubisoft's UPlay, which requires you to set up an account.  Annoying.  Finally get through that and some graphical issues causing the game to minimize on startup to find that, yes the game itself now wants me to set up an account!  Annoying.  Do that and then, oh we need to restart to download updates!  Annoying.  Finally reboot and get the game to launch and log in.  It's been an hour.  Frustrated.  Try to figure out exactly what I'm supposed to do at this main menu of sorts.... end up clicking on quick start to the campaign.  Game session begins.  No tutorial.  Start clicking around to see whats up and clicking on the Ark (the main building platform) and this has the effect of muting and dismissing the guy in the top right trying to tell me what I need to do to complete this mission.  No idea what to do.  Game isn't helping.Don't buy this game unless you enjoy setting up various pointless accounts and being thrown into a gameplay environment with zero tutorial.

												Anno is an RTS god type game that combines the fun of You need a Budget with a game for the UI.  This game is a challenging RTS game, it is NOT a fun RTS game.  Is a challenge fun, of course we love challenges as gamers.  The only challenge is fitting all that stuff onto tiny islands, take away the islands, and there is no challenge.  See that picture for the store page with the boat?  That boat is not in the game, and I never had the fun feeling of waving to anyone in this game.  Because in this game you can't click the little people and see their needs, even roller coaster tycoon games going back 10 years let us click the little people.  The Coconut Queen would be displeased by all this whining from these people wanting more sushi or cell phones, each person wanting like 10 cell phones made me call them Annitches.  Skip this game get Tropico, its super fun caring for little Tropicans as El Presidente, or for a real challenge take on Civ.Buncha Annitches... On that note, play me out Jay-Z in the key of 99 Problems, starting at, ""I aint tryin to see no highway chase with Jake""I aint tryin to see all my time go to waste,Plus I got the DLC to make sure I dont wait,So I... played til the game told me, take a break, Son, do you know what I'm stopping you for??Cuz, this sucks, and its boring, and it really does blow,Do I look like I'm havin any fun, I dont know.This game is real long so you should grab some snacks,Well, this aint worth 55 and it aint worth four, Thought I'd play a game, thought I'd have some fun, I'm a fan'a god games, I know alot of you are.Bought this game on steam so I know its legit,Well do you mind letting the game make sure about it?For DRM theres Uplay, with TAGES, on toppa Steam, with over 35 install steps, its justa bad dream.Well, isnt this game full of crap,Everyones a pirate or somethin,Buying games to steal them or something.Well, there aint no tutorials, the game gives no hints,So get used to googling to find tips and tricks.Well, we'll see how smart you are if the day ever comes.Two thousand seventy problems, and this game's number one,If you buy this game, you'll be wishin you bought a gun,Two thousand seventy problems, and this game's number one.Im seriously not joking, Anno aint no fun,Your gonna have a bad time, I feel bad for you son,Don't buy Anno 2070, it sucked, deleted, done...Rating:  2/10  Value:  $2.99			",2655,1122,101,267,367,29,398

												Great city builder and commerce manager. If coming from other  Anno games, it is much more streamlined. The game is tons of fun and has a great deal of replayabillity. What's more is with the ARK system you can do things in one game to effect other games. My criteria for games is did I have fun the entire time I played it? For Anno 2070, yes I did.

												Starting up the game is a trial itself. I spent around half an hour just to get it running. And even then, it was riddled with crashes (5 crashes in under 20 min)If anyone is interested in how to get it running at least once:First, I had to enter the key, and wait for the uplay installer to update the recently downloaded game.Then uplay started crashing, had to enter go to the Anno 2070 installation folder, right click the game.exe and set it to win xp compatibility mode. The game will refuse to launch through steam as it will crash on startup, you must open it directly through the game folder game.exe.After setting up the uplay account, which again asked for the key, I was able to start the game.I thought my troubles would end there, however.... The game crashed 4 times in the first campaign mission (3 of which were during the last cinematic, and the fact that Anno doesn't seem to have an auto-save is even more irritating). I inicially thought it was a problem in only the first campaign mission, but the second mission crashed 2 minutes in, I gave up playing after that.Although I played for an extremely limited amount of time, I have to say. Anno 2070 would have been a great game if it were playable, I've seen many early access titles more stable than this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The climate has changed, sea levels have risen… What a great time for a strategy game! Anno 2070 is a futuristic real-time strategy game focused on city management and colonization. The game provides a good campaign that deals with the kind-of-steep learning curve. Harvest resources, explore new land and waters, engage in diplomacy and much more.The gameplay is very smooth and well made, the graphics and sound quality is excellent. There are global community votes that actually effect how the game is played, I found this to be a nice little feature to include. Developing your cities takes time, this does get tedious during certain moments of the game, but usually you can find something to do while you wait for whatever it is you're doing.Anno 2070 is a great strategy game and has me going for several hours at a time, even though the game asks me to take a break every hour I find it hard to put down!

												Until you're not an expert in handle ur OS and internet-connection devices get ur hand of this game. If u take a look into the forum, u'll see that a lot of people got a problem with the server-connection, u need at least one time for playing. There's a guy, who hasn't fix that issue, yet, since he bought it at summer-sale 2013. Ubisoft support just gives an automate written email at hand with a lot of oppurtunities to solve the problem. Shutting down ur DHCP-service for example. Kinda bull**** since u need this service to get an IP for ur inet-connection. However, in my case nothing worked at all and unfortunately it seems to me, like Ubisoft doesn't care much at all about it.I'm really a great fan of the Anno-series and played it from the beginning, so I'm right sure this sequel is minimum as good and addicting as the last ones, but since I can't run it, it doesn't matter to me. However, u might be lucky and it will run fine, like it does in other cases, but by reading this be intensly warned.In my case I'm truly fond of supporting developing games I like by buying them original, like I was by buying Anno2070, but for now it seems to me, that there isn't any solution than cracking the game, what means giving the multiplayer a miss.

												Dont buy. Simply dont. While the game it self was actually quite good, it is unfortunately distrubuted by what I am starting to considder the largest scamming/pirate company in the world: Ubisoft. They use ""Uplay"" which people below have name u-dont-play, and with good reason. Like many others like me the Uplay launcher crashes on startup, and I am not even able to start playing this game. Meaning, they got my money, alongside many others, but they do not deliver...I would personally like to see this company closed down (unfortunately they are propably to big). But a good place to start would be to make sure that Steam Users are not lured into wasting money on games that will not work (the game worked last year I think, not sure when the launcher started crashing to be honest).So, Steam, PLEASE remove ANY game that utilzs Uplay, or at least make a VERY significant warning that this is a Ubisoft games and several have reported nonworking products from them.---Had the game worked I would have given it a thumbs up, but it doesnt and havnt for too long (we are talking several months, and most likely more than half a year. And Ubisoft simply dont care, they received the money, they dont seem to feel they need to provide a game for that.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												BIGGEST WASTE OF MONEY I EVER DID.Gameplay wise it looks good, trailers look good, heck even the deal it came with during the summer sale was awesome. My rig is powerful enough to play it. So yeah, looks like its definitely a great game to get.There's only one problem.It won't work. No matter what I do, the game won't load because of the constant errors from the Uplay launcher that i've gotten tired trying to figure out how to fix it. Which is something that any person shouldn't really experience after they used their hard earned money to acquire a game legitly. So yeah. Big regret right here. Spare yourself the heart ache and buy something else instead			",93,8,4,13,13,1,6

												I was very hesitant to play this game, seeing the steam reviews are at 62 percent.   I shouldn't have been. Anno 2070 is a very unique and amazing game.  It's an economy simulator, a bit similar to Simcity, with minor Civilization elements (mostly in combat).   However the important difference in this game is that combat is more of a last resort, not a constant need in the game.  In fact in the campaign there's really three missions with any combat, and two that require combat, and only one with more than a minute of necessary combat.The focus on the game is more development of a city/civilization.  There's two major paths in the game.  You can go with the ""Ecos"" or the ""Tycoons"" and let me stop here and say the first thing I thought was it's going to be a story about ""the hippies freaks"" versus ""the capitalist swine""....Well it's not.  There is just two forms of civilization.  Ecos try to stay in balance with nature, not abusing it but growing food.  Tycoons tend to be more destructive to nature, but get some items far easier (while others have to be grown which is harmed by their production).  Tycoon sound like an easier option, but neither is particularly overly balanced.  Tycoons are easier to play at the beginning because they can just create the equivalent to strip mines.   But Ecos can consistently stay in the race because once they're set up they keep getting benefits.   The ecological impact of Tycoons are (mostly) non permanent.  They can destroy a strip mine and get back the negative ecology effects too.  So experimenting or completely redesigning the world is acceptable, and in fact I like that feature of the game. As for the Story, again I thought ""Man vs Nature"" was going to be core.  And I was completely wrong.  There was one point in the story where you chose between the two, and the only thing that did was decide which type of building you got.  There was no great conflict between the two, and the conflict came from an outside group.   The campaign story was great in my opinion.  The story kept progressing at a good pace, but what was great is the game teaches you how to build your cities for about half of the story.  The downside is that when the game doesn't teach you something (and there's a lot of small spaces), you either need to check the internet or read massive data logs and hope it's explained.   I had a problem in campaign Chapter 3, Mission 3, where I couldn't figure out what's wrong.  There was an oil spill that was killing my fish production.  Low fish production meant people weren't getting fish that was harming my taxes.  The game gently mentioned the oil spill was a problem, but this was the end of the game, there was no way to know how to fix the oil spill (which involved a number of unintuitive steps)  and because I didn't do that my money was just bleeding out.  There also was not a second mention of ""maybe you should fix the oil"".    This type of lack of information almost made me give up until someone online said ""you have to clean up the oil spill"" and laid out the steps.  A lot of annoying steps, and they had to be done early because without the money for the steps, you are doomed. So the coolest part of the campaign though is it's nine or ten mission over three Chapters.  Each mission has a small story arc but your buildings persist in between missions, when a new chapter begins you do start over.   But if you have a really good layout, you keep it after building the mission.  This is both a strength and a negative.  It means you start to feel for the cities you're building, and your decisions and layouts will matters, so you can't just push for the final goal, but rather should build a good city. The downside is if you've screwed up your city and just barely win, you are left with a screwed up city.  Such as in Chapter 3 Mission 3.  I had a real problem, and now had to deal with it.  Of course I could go back to playing mission 2, and fix the problems (I don't know if that was possible but imagine you have a huge negative balance and finish the mission).  But with the later missions taking hours, I don't know if I ever wanted to go back and replay one of those missions. The other side is I don't think there's ever a ""lose"" condition in the campaign.  However, you can create layouts that are so grossly ineffective that they are like a ""lose"" condition.   If you go more then 5k in the red, that might be so bad you'll never climb out of it.  When it's that low, you can't buy things, and some of the ways out will be to buy items.  You can instead destroy objects, and build objects that don't cost the credits the game requires.  But you will lose the ability to build roads, a crucial piece of development (if you aren't connected by a road, your building won't work)  The difference between a working configuration and a grossly ineffective configuration isn't that big.  Being unable to get enough resources, will start to lose the player money fast, and the game can sometimes over upgrade and create these problems itself with no player interaction.  A city with a 1000 credit income can quickly become a city with a deficit without player interaction.  That really sucks.   There's ways to mitigate this, but the player is never really told to watch out for this, and the tools to mitigate this are weak. Overall though if you avoid a few pitfalls, the campaign is a delight, the story is pretty good, and the gameplay is great.  The final chapter of the campaign seems to remove the hands and just let the player play the game, giving abstract goals (build X on the third tier of development) and let the player have to get through the first 2 tiers themselves.   At that point the player has already done all that development so it should be easy, though time consuming. Once you move away from the campaign, things get a little murkier.  There are a number of single missions, and they are all in-depth.   The issue is these are single missions and they are LONG.   Probably taking a couple hours or so due to the length of the supply chains involved in the early ones.  Later ones I'm sure take even longer. This isn't a negative necessarily, but what worked well in the campaign (build a city and keep it for the next mission) is gone here.  If you spend two hours and beat the first single mission, that's gone.   with at least 12 missions that means you're going to be building 12 cities. Some of this stuff is just UI.  I'd love to have ""planned"" my city, and then let the game build it over time.  I also wouldn't mind better balance sheets, or more helpful hints when things go wrong.   When building a city, if you don't have the ""pieces"" you're out of luck, and have to wait for the city to generate (or trade) for the pieces. Trade is also a little wonky.  If you have two cities on two different islands, they have their own commerce.  That makes sense.  The problem is that you have to build supply chains for EVERYTHING.  And to do that, you have to select one island, then the other, load a good on one island and then off load it at the other.  You need to manually build every trade route and that takes a decent amount of time, and then even more before the route really becomes effective. The final thing I'd like to talk about is the piece I played with the least.  Apparently the game has a persistent player, that is in all games.  Your ""base"", the ARK is the same between maps, and what this means is you can store goods on one map and take them to another.  This is HUGE of course.  It also is given upgrades, and you can keep those as you change maps.   I'm at the character limit so I should wrap this up even though I have more.  Overall Anno 2070 is pretty damn good.  I didn't have any of the issues with uPlay that others have had, and I'd recommend this game for people who want something that's a cross between Civilization and SimCity.   It's quirky but it's solid.			",427,129,17,51,43,6,82

												3rd party DRM made this game a pain to play multiplayer, which is a real shame since its multiplayer is the most enjoyable aspect of this game. It still has playability in single player matches against AI although but after a little while of playing the AI can become a bit predictable, i'd suggest only buying it when it is on 75% / 50% off.With its current price of 29.99 i cannot recommend buying this game at this moment. If its on sale at 50% off to 75% off consider taking a look at it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

To play the game you need to run steam as an admin and then you need to redownload the game again, so in total its 8gig instead of 4.Ubisoft is such a disgrace, there should be a big fat warning in steam when buying ubisoft games.

												The 1 hour of play time involved me trying to get Uplay to work, then re-downloading this game (I already downloaded and installed it on steam, why do it again on Uplay? Horrible, horrible system). When I finally jumped through all of the hoops to get the game downloaded, I loaded it up. I was quite excited to play the game, despite the hurdles involved getting to it.""Error connecting to the Server. Please check your internet connection."".....My connection is fine. I click okay on the message, and it sits and spools at ""login"" for 10 minutes. I finally decide that enough is enough and uninstall it, along with Uplay. Way to go Ubi, you've lost a good customer. I won't even buy your games for console anymore. Good day.			",74,28,1,45,28,1,59

												Purchase Anno 2070 and you'll need to also install Ubisoft's incredibly buggy DRM software, U-Play, which you can read more about in other comments.As for my personal experience: after a long download, install, and update process, I was finally allowed to login to U-Play, hoping to play the game I bought. Unfortunately it then crashed every single time I logged in, preventing the game from even loading. I was given a refund from Steam, and will avoid any U-Play enabled games in the future.In short, the software Ubisoft created in order to prevent piracy, actually makes the game unplayable, forcing people to pirate their games as the only means of playing them. After trying the cracked version as a result, I can say the game is quite good! Just don't buy it from Ubisoft.			",18,4,1,6,6,0,1

												This is a fantastic game, both in looks and gameplay.  An absolute blast to play either alone or with other players, with an improved but simplified combat aspect from previous entries.  But the game really revolves around economy and tech progression, and it really shines there.  If you always wanted to build and maintain an entire socieities supply chain then this is your game.  Three different races with various differences provide further playability.  This game can really suck the hours away, though it does give you in game suggestions to take a break which I always ignored.  I couldn't recommend this game any more.  But it has Uplay which is the absolute worst when it comes to DRM and will often lock you out of playing.  God forbid you upgrade your computer because then you won't be able to play at all.  It really ♥♥♥♥ing hurts to say this,  but do not get this game.  JUST PIRATE IT FOR ♥♥♥♥S SAKE			",72,2,0,6,11,0,33

												The game itself is makes a very good impression, but there are a few points that totally destroy the fun with it.1.) Like with many other games you have to install a completely useless tool (UPlay) to play the game. Not only is the tool frequently broken, it programmed so badly it slows down the computer.2.) Features in the Solo-Game nead online connection. When in the description is written I need a connection for multiplayer mode, I expect ALL solo features to work without it, otherwise you have to write the game needs a connection not only one mode of it. Clear case of customer misinformation to increase sales.3.) The AI of the NPCs is totally screwed up, as they build no cities. All there settlements seam to be a randomly scattered collection of a few building-types, even if these sets of buildings vary between different NPCs  it looks just strange.4.) Bugs. I frequently encountered bugs like, complete reset of all researched technologies, boni that were substracted instead of added and so on.			",15,3,0,12,14,0,8

												So much to do with hours of fun. Many empires to build and enemies to defeat. Oh did I mention underwater Bases too? Game is detailed on all levels from economy, trading, diplomacy, etc. Combat though can be a bit weak, but makes up for it in natural disasters, like oil spills (if you have oil rigs or someone else does) Tsunamis’ if you have the proper DLC, and various infections that can poison your empires food supply.Having to counter those disasters can take a while if you’re not prepared for it. Still getting into the game myself, and must say the game is a great buy. I would definitely recommend it, especially if you have friends to play with. On that note, This review is based solely off of the game itself. No DRM negative review because DRM and UPlay sucks. I could care less, as I already had a Uplay account and the game was easily linked with no problems.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Anno 2070 – Complete Edition is a strategy city building simulator. Decades after the global warming that melted the polar caps and changed the face of the Earth, you are put in charge of an Ark: an aquatic base of operation that travels the seas to establish new settlements on oceanic islands, managing economy, resource exploitation and relations with other factions. This review includes all DLCs and the Deep Ocean expansion set.Pros: This is a great addition to the Anno series, this time taking place in the fairly-near future without going too sci-fi (that's for Anno 2205 to do). Like past iterations of the franchise, you start with a limited amount of resources and must build industries with to make more building material. Citizen classes are upgraded by providing commodities, and the quantity of citizens you have of each various classes will unlock more buildings and options. The game looks great, factions are easily recognizable and the islands are gorgeous. You can play a continuous free-mode game or pick from a large selection of mission challenges. You also have a campaign mode which is a great gradual introduction to the evolving selection of buildings and to the factions you can side with. You pick between the economically-strong Global Trust or the ecologically-sustaining Eden Initiative factions, and can also ally yourself to the scientific and underwater-expert S.A.A.T. faction. The Uplay community is actually made use of for something else than serving as a DRM: the various factions will regularly put up proposals players can vote on, there are online elections to pick a governing faction that will offer changing bonuses, and the game downloads a temporary ""mission-of-the-day"" Daily Event.Cons: The game doesn't have an actual tutorial, so even the introductory campaign will leave you wondering whether the next step is a building, an option, or an upgrade. Combat was obviously not the focus of the game which makes PvP multiplayer games hard to win. Although all three factions have different buildings and citizen needs, they ultimately are the same thing with different name on them: Global Trust has Distilleries while Eden Initiative has Tea Plantations, S.A.A.T. has a production chain for Carbon while Global Trust has one for Concrete, etc. The material or commodities a faction can't make itself are material it simply doesn't make use of or commodities its citizen doesn't care for, so there is little need to trade with other factions.Verdict: ★★★★☆ - Next on your listThis is a great city builder! Like other games of the Anno series, it's very different to manage building material and citizens commodities than the usual complexities of budget, taxes and municipal services. If you enjoyed past games of the franchise, or simply want to try a different formula than the other City Builders out there, I strongly recommend giving Anno 2070 – Complete Edition a try!P.S.: The included Uplay appears to be broken for many people, so you must manually download the latest version (which you can do here[ubi.li]) or the game may not work at all. That's too bad for what is essentially a good game.—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												I love the predecessor games AD 1701 and AD 1401, but this one isn't good. Preachy environmentalism and forcedly-corrupt capitalism turned a great franchise into a downer.  AD 1701 has a fun, happy, Caribbean feel to it. AD 1401 is super complex but awesome mechanically, with a West-meets-East setting.  They are both impeccably polite and perfectly British.2070 has none of the charm of its earlier games and makes no real improvements to playability or mechanics.  Let's hope the next Anno game is better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Anno 2070 is a beautiful game. This city builder is unique in its play style and will have you invested all the way through. There are countless special buildings you can work to build, all the while maintaining your peoples happiness and well being. There are even global events that you can participate in and when completed, you can earn yourself some special items. The only downside to this game I see is the fact that you need to download the Ubisoft launcher.			",101,4,0,19,13,1,10

If you discount this, rather glaring, issue with the game; this is one of my favorite of the Anno series--and even of all city building games.

												I'm sure this game will be/is fantastic IF you can get the mandatory online play part to work.Just purchased yesterday. I have spent 30 minutes so far navigating the jargon of Ubisoft, and I am NOT pleased with my experience.I even have an excellent gaming PC and fantastic internet ability, but the company is crap for requiring always-online server play. It nullifies the experience, especially when Ubisoft seems unable to actually provide the type of networking they need.It's all bull and I won't buy another of their games EVER again. They were even keen to make me use another form because I happen to be several months under the age of 18, which I completely understand, but it would be nice if the website they directed me to was actually available.The poor planning behind what looks like a beautiful experience has made me less keen to enjoy it. I'm glad I paid only $13 instead of the rediculous $50 price of the regular bundle. What baffoons these developers are! I'd even go as far to say it's worse than the launch of SimCity 2013. And that's saying something. Long rant short: great game, I love what I see, however, if your computer and ISP aren't up to the challenge, abandon all hope of getting to enjoy it. Meanwhile, I'm going to try again to actually play.			",0,2,0,1,24,0,17

												This is a review of the product that stops with the log-in screen to UPlay. Thankfully, I picked this up on sale, so I didn't waste too much money trying it out. I installed the game through Steam, and when I launched it through the Steam app, it then proceeded to install ""UPlay"" that took, and I kid you not, another 15 minutes to load, patch, repatch, repatch again, and finally launch, then demanding that I create a UPlay account. I immediately uninstalled it without bothering. I will never, never, never, never, never, never, EVER purchase another game from UBISoft. Period. So, good job, UBISoft! I've read other Fanbois (or UBISoft shills, more likely) defending the UPlay DRM before I decided to post my ""review."" They can defend this BS as much as they want, but they won't receive my patronage a second time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the best economic simulation game I've played so far! It's very detailed and realistic. I love how futuristic it is, the graphics still amazes me. Also the soundtrack is just perfect - almost every piece of it! There are 3 factions you can choose to play: Ecos, Tycoons and Techs and all of them are equally cool and well done and I like playing each of them. When you choose Ecos, your island looks just stunning - all the greenery, chirping birds, clear water, peaceful setting. On the other hand, when you choose to play Tycoons, your island gradually gets polluted and you can really see the process. Eventually, there are acid rains, oil spills on the ocean's surface, typhoons devastating neighboring islands. Techs can be unlocked after reaching a specific level of development on the island. This game has really a lot to offer in the single player mode, but man, the online multiplayer mode is what keeps you awake all night long! You can play a cooperation, you can be enemies, you can have either separate islands or manage one island together, set trade routes with your ships, declare wars between each other or NPCs, build airports, fleets, underwater facilities and many more! If you wanna try, clear your schedule at least for 5 hours!			",19,1,0,0,2,0,1

												This series is not evolving into the right direction. The first game in the series was 1602 and this game was amazing. 2070 is just a bad copy of the original translated into a futuristic environment. This kills the flair of the predecessors. It just doesn't work well in a future scenario.In addition to the over complicated counter intuitive user interface the DRM is killing the last bit of fun. I loaded the game within 11 minutes and it took me another 60 minutes to get the game installed, registered, activated and updated. In addition the steam integration is not working all the time which took another 20 minutes to find a workaround.In summary this game is disappointing. ",140,34,2,43,49,0,41

												Not only does this game make you register and install a special little sales domain for UbiSoft and try to get you to subscribe to a variety of newsletters in the process - in the most annoying way possible - the required updater for that theme park of greed is broken.  And once you manually fix it, you still have to wait for the game to update itself, over and over.I strongly recommend that no one PAY for this game, since you spend so long working at getting to the point where you can play it.  PAYING for this game would be a mistake, even if it is a fun game.			",40,1,0,13,5,0,13

												I have uninstalled and reinstalled this game 3 times. UPLAY will note properly install - this prevents any and all attempts to play the game.

												ANNO series is great (as well as Settlers), but Ubisoft managed to ruin everything.I sincerely hope that each and every individual in Ubisoft directly or indirectly responsible for the creation of Uplay will be merrily sizzling for the eternity in the hottest, stinkiest, and the most unpleasant level of Hell. Of course, they should be given a chance for redemption, which they will be able to obtain by merely logging into their Uplay account. So burning till the end of time seems to be their only option, anyway.			",50,3,0,14,15,0,33

												Took a leap of faith with this one. Never played any of the other Anno games but was intrigued by the concept. Lucky I did. The gameplay was fantastic, graphics were beautiful. The story was short but good. One thing I really love about the game is the replay value. Trying to get your culture to the pinnacle of society and combining the other factions to help was awesome. The game can be lengthy which in my opinion is great. The combat could have been done slightly better. Not a fan of requiring the Tech's airplanes to finish off islands or waiting for your boats to starve them out by taking out the ports. Overall a very great game			",26,7,1,13,21,0,26

I enjoyed the Anno series, but Ubisoft couldn't get it more wrong than this with the 1000 patches and the Uplay that interferes with Steam. If you have your own store and want to make me signup, then don't do it on Steam.Only purchase this game if you can spend a few hours before playing.

												The older Anno games are superior in every way except graphics, and the graphics on this one are so overdone that this game, an RTS, over-stressed my video card more than any other game I own, which includes all CryEngine games. The initial experience is that it patches the patcher to patch the updater which updates the initial installation of uPlay garbage that Ubisoft inflicts upon you in order that you might eventually be allowed to play the game. After 5 patching screens, I get the UPlay program open, and still no way to play the actual game. Had to kill uPlay with task manager and restart, and finally got uPlay to acknowledge that, yes, I have the right to run the game. Thank you. Can I play now? No, actually, I need to put up with in-game ad for ANNO online, and a request to go fill out a survey about my ANNO playing experience on Survey Monkey. Really, guys? Are you serious?!When you do get to play, I find it to be too much story, too many distractions from game-characters, and campaign scenarios that are uneven in quality. For example, where you need to just build a city that produces so much fish, and then the scenario is over. Weak. It is also uneven in hand-holding, where I found it irritating to be told exactly what to do next, and then suddenly run into a situation where I had no idea of what to do to get some stat up to the critical level for the hokey scenario to finish.As a game, it isn't terrible. If your video card is less than three years old, you might be OK on that front, though my dual-GPU card was definitely stressed to the point of an early heat-death... that was on the lowest settings, to be clear. On my new system, at the time of writing this, it works very quietly on the lowest settings. Now that I've reloaded it on my new system, I will probably enjoy it more, but my earlier experience has soured me on Ubisoft, and ANNO 2070, certainly.It is, underneath the hokey storlline, an ANNO game in the end. But for me, I just cannot get over having to put up with the idiocy that is uPlay. I've promised myself to never pay money for a UbiSoft game again, due to that crap.It's pretty. Underneath a butt-load of flourishes, bells, and overdone whistles, it is an ANNO game. But, I recommend dropping back to a previous ANNO and playing that instead.			",132,22,0,33,37,1,65

												This is a beautiful game, easy to pick up and with a user-friendly interface. But set against the backdrop of its predecessors, I can't recommend it. Every time I opened it up I was left feeling saddened by the missed opportunity.There is a built-in conflict described between the eco-focused and development-focused factions, but this conflict isn't enforced by the game's resource exploitation models and tech trees. They took it halfway there with an eco-damage mechanic, but the two factions should have been forced to adopt diametrically opposed progress conditions, rather than the carbon copy mechanics we see here. An example: both sides possess the same number of housing tech levels, with the same mechanic for evolving them (population numbers plus availability of secondary goods). Since there is very little crossover of secondary goods, there is no tension between eco and development factions when reaching the highest goal - the ecos don't care about lobsters and champagne, and there's enough rice farms to go around. Instead, we should have seen the developers require huge numbers of tightly-packed houses to advance, coupled with a flourishing economy; and the ecos requiring a low number of big-footprint houses coupled with minimal environmental impact. This means that the factions would always find it hard to coexist at the top development levels, and it'd always occur to one or the other that things would be so much simpler if the other's stuff would just start blowing up.Which leads to the second problem. The tactical and strategic combat wasn't thought through very well at all. Put simply, you don't make rock-paper-scissors work better by restricting the number of choices players have. All three flavours of combat units - air, land, sea - should be available, and the balance between them should be a determining strategic factor. Strengths versus weaknesses. Instead we have a world with NO land-based forces except for the occasional (and limited) turret, restricted air availability, and a poor tech advancement tree.A caveat on the last: there is actually a brilliant research and development tree available via the scientist faction. Unfortunately, it doesn't have the impact on gameplay that it deserves. There is no need to pursue a technological race with your adversary, since it's far more efficient to just spam out more low-tech units.Makes me sad, considering how brilliant parts of this game are. Lost opportunity. Then again, maybe I should just get off my♥♥♥♥♥♥and learn modding, since the game is well supported in this area.			",157,27,0,36,33,0,49

I think that states that this game is wonderful. I love the strategy, citybuilder and micromanagement. It's all the love I have/had for Anno 1404, with a new look and feel.I realize that a lot of people avoid the Anno-series because of uplay, but honestly I haven't had any major difficulties with it.

												I've owned this game for quite some time now, and yet I've never played it.  Steam says I have played for 4 minutes, but that is 4 minutes worth of accumulated time trying to start the game.  Once I hit play Uplay starts running.  Within seconds it crashes and that is the end of that.  If I manage to actually get past this immediate crashing, Uplay starts a loop that takes me back to the beginning where it crashes again.What the hell is wrong with the people at Uplay?  Why ruin a game like this?  From what I understand this is a great game and I'd love to try it, but since Uplay wants to stand in my way I can't play it and can't give it a proper review.  I also own From Dust, a game that I absolutely love, and yet I can't play it on Steam.  If I hadn't played it on Xbox I would never have known.  Uplay, you are ruining the experience for the gamer as well as the audience for the developer.  What a pain.			",114,34,6,10,54,2,11

												Do not buy this game from Steam. Once downloaded, it also requires the Uplay application to run the game. Steam and Uplay don't work well with each other. So far I did not get the game to start and there are many others with the same problems. Just visit the ANNO 2070 forum on Steam. About every 3rd post is a complaint about Uplay and the game that does not start properly. It's  a mess! Steam as distributor and Ubisoft as publisher have done a very bad job connecting their 2 platforms and the users have to pay for it. And even if you get it to work, you have to run both applications (Steam AND Uplay) in order to play the game. Just utterly annoying. Then again, I would already be happy if I could play at all...

												Uses Uplay. Very badly. Patch process takes ages and contains lots of headaches, mostly because of bugs and plain bad programming in Uplay. Patching can't be done in the background because it needs you to accept the same licence four or five times at different points during the patch process. DRM and downloading seems to be recursive. Will ruin any enjoyment long before you have the game running. Don't bother.			",138,41,0,18,38,1,31

												Seriously? The game asked for the cd key 2-3 times & has more DRM software & launchers, as usual for Ubisoft. It ""bound"" the game to my ubisoft account at least twice. Also, you can't change your profile name after you make one. Stay AWAY from this game, and any game that treats you like a thief and punishes you for buying it.			",304,126,0,65,24,2,43

												1.  I'm not sure what Uplay is or what it does, but I don't like having it forced on me.  If it offers me something worthwhile, then I'll opt in.  Not giving me a choice simply shows that you have no confidence that I'd opt in if given the choice.  If you have no confidence in what your own software offers the consumer, then why should I?2.  Between all the patching and updating and trying to figure out what Uplay was and why it wouldn't just let me play the game and registering and being told I couldn't play in offline mode, it took me about 45min to get to the game's main menu.3.  The game felt eco-preachy right off the bat.  This isn't what I'm looking for in a game.4.  If the game has a tutorial of any sort, I couldn't find it.  I figured it must be built into the campaign, but that didn't seem to be the case either.  Instead of a mission walking me through the game mechanics, I'm given some terse orders and vague goals with no clue as to how to reach them.5.  I was feeling plenty grumpy by this point and remembered I have a number of other games waiting for my time in my Steam library.  So I decided to go play them instead.  I doubt I'll be back.  You only get one chance to make a good first impression, Ubisoft.			",28,4,0,10,16,0,17

												I don't recommend this game for only one reason - Anno 1404, its predacessor, is SO much better.This entry in the series is a technical advance, but it has taken the organic feel of 1404 and sterilised it, losing a lot in the process. Much of the appeal of the original was finding your own solution to a very broad set of objectives, but 2070 adds a campaign that provides a rigid structure to the missions that feels far too constrained, and it has thrown in additional mechanics that serve only to restrict how you can build and interact with the world.If you enjoy these kinds of management games, I'd recommend picking up 1404 plus its expansion, Venice, before even considering Anno 2070.

Every single other game I own, as long as not Uplay, run perfectly and never crashes.This one never started, even after spending hours on Steam/Ubisoft FAQ and forums, I failed at fixing this game.If you have previous recent Uplay games then it's safe to assume this one will run on your machine. If you don't, well, it's at your own risk - my request for a refund was denied.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My mind is twisted about this game. Sure, it looks fantastic and at first glance has a lot of depth. After I bought it I was very excited of finally calling it my own. But that's where the trouble started. The Ubisoft launcher is a catastrophy to put it mildly. It took hours for countless updates to install and I had to enter my serials three times. Needless to say that my excitement about the game shrank considerably. The whole point of buying games on steam for me is to avoid all the nasty installation procedures, click a button and more or less start playing. The only good news here is, that after going through the hellfire of the initial installation the launcher is less agonizing. Still it may take 10 Minutes to just launch the game. Big fail.When you can FINALLY start to play you're pretty much on your own in a world you know only little about. There's a campaign mode which I tried to start with. Quickly I ran into trouble just because I couldn't figure out what to do in order to fulfill the goals. The game doesn't teach you at all. I abandoned the campaign mode and went for the sandbox. Youtube videos on how to play the game helped me to make some progress and pretty soon I settled on a bunch of islands doing great. The game became fun! Big plus ... But that was about all I got. The game just became stale. There was nothing left to do. So the few moments of excitement went away and now I can't be bothered to turn the game on again. What a shame, but this game is honestly one of the most boring and repeatative games I have ever played. Despite it's beauty and appearant depth, there just isn't much of a challenge left to it once you've played for a few hours.So I'm sorry to say that I can't recommend this great but utterly boring game. The ubisoft launcher alone kinda kills it to begin with, but the gameplay just didn't manage to excite me enough to forget about this.			",41,37,2,1,10,0,8

												Anno 2070 has been my absolute favourite RTS game. Long games, complex system and decent military tactics. My to go game for ""I have so much time and don't know what to do with it"" right after skyrim. Negative side is Uplay, but not as big of a deal after Ubisoft implemented Steam syncronization. Overall I love this game and would gladly recomend it for someone who is willing to learn the system.			",109,10,0,7,13,0,6

												Before i begine. I WILL NOT COUNT ANY ISSUES WITH U-PLAY AS ISSUES WITH THIS GAME! (those who do downvote and ruin a great game based on issues with the drm system that isnt THIS games fault.) All in All, this is a fun game. Its full of a rather LARGE number of things to do if you get the final, complete version. has quite a bit of gameplay mechanics to learn and enjoy, and so long as your patient, can give  you plenty of challenges to enjoy. the learning curve isnt overwhelming but there is one to it, but as with any city builder/resource management game, thats to be expected. all in alll i give this gameGraphics:9/10 (a few issues here and there with graphical bugs but mostly perfection)Sound 10/10 (the music is beautiful, with decent sound effects and good quality to sound placement (and a few funny things from your dwellers if you zoom in on them)Story 7/10 (This game lacks somewhat in the story department. It does have a story but nothing grand or utterly new. As you would expect, Nature, Money, Science, Take a choice and the story follows.)Gui/Controles 8/10 (the controles feel pretty natural for a game of this type, though there where some issues finding things in the GUI at first. The controles and keys can be remapped in game which is a plus and once you learn the basic locations of things, it gets really easy)Overall 8.5/10 (Go and play this game. you will enjoy it)*side note* I have never experianced ANY issues ever with uplay. I have, however, Seen plenty of issues both here and with friends, dealing with the DRM system crashing. I recommend you download uplay from ubisoft and make sure that, not only can you run it, but that you find out what is causing the crash in the first place (most of the issues and solutions can be found online, with a short google search. The game issue i found with friends is that it wasnt installed using Admin mode or run under admin mode with windows 7 and up) ",142,49,0,32,33,1,29

												I spent more time installing this game - than playing it so I hear it was supposed to be pretty good.  However, Having to install Uplay and then having to use my cell phone to activate a google authenticator.  Even to access my online uplay account I had to get another code from google authenticator in order to log in online.  I ultimately decided to uninstall this.  If they are so worried about me stealing then it is not worth my time.  I wanted something simple.. not all this DRMOn another note, I was not too keen on the futuristic one world order stuff in the game for sustainablity.. call me old fashioned but overall I just want a simple RTS like Age of Empires, etc.			",3,0,0,1,18,0,10

												Hear me out when I say that this is a WONDERFUL game, but you really shouldn't purchase it unless you enjoy downloading separate gaming clients in order to play your games. Before you can even start the game, you're required to download Ubisoft's own ""UPlay"" client and make an account solely for that service. That isn't the end of it, though. As additional obstacles, you'll also need to log in to the game through UPlay, then once more in-game. It's a real shame that so much is required of you to play such a great game. In an effort to convince Ubisoft that this sort of purchasing model is both unnecessary and undesirable, I'll never buy another Ubisoft game through Steam (unless I hear that things have changed). On a final note, I'll say that this is the only Steam purchase I've ever regretted, and my Steam library consists of 70+ games. *Just a fair warning.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this game through Steam, a fine and trusted resource...or so I thought. In order to play the game, after downloading, I had to sit through about 40 minutes of patches, including a forced membership with Ubisoft's useless 'Uplay', followed by patches for Uplay, followed by downloading the game again, through Ubisoft's sad little robotic clone of Steam. Steam says I have played this game for over an hour. I played it for 2 minutes last night, just to see that it works, only to have to sit through more updates, a faulty uplay connection, and the second download today! I don't even know if this is a good game or not, but if their choice in publisher is any indication of it's makers' good judgement and professionalism, then I have my doubts. I will never buy another title with the word 'Uplay' anywhere near it. Ubisoft might as well be on that list as well. This kind of abuse of a captive consumer makes pirating seem attractive, and justified. I believe in paying people for their hard work, but I work hard for my money too, and this waste of time feels like theft to me.			",16,7,0,6,8,0,8

												Bought this game as a good way to excercise memory and multitasking skills. Unfortunately, this game ends up frustrating the casual gamer due to its programming style of keeping the player constantly micro-managing items. Ends in wasting a lot of time and it is rather pointless as entertainment value of a game. The other game aspects such as missions and graphics are satisfactory and graphics are ok for mid range computing power. Noticed some slight bugs but otherwise pretty solid as a game build. I purchased game on a Steam sale but I would have regretted paying full price. The fun factor is only 5 out of 10. IF the micro-managing was made simpler and game play focusing more on building and battle tactics then this would have been a fun game. I would only recommend this to supertaskers, but because I am a casual to mid range gamer I would have to say purchase only when the price is in the bargain territory.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's like someone at Ubisoft is scared of making money or something. I can honestly say I won't be buying anything else from them until they ditch their ridiculous DRM.

												Don't buy this on Steam.  Just don't.  Buy it elsewhere, because it's usable there.  Anno 2070 is essentially the block before Simcity 2014, by a different AAA publisher.  Always online DRM, launching through Uplay, and really-sketchy Steam integration makes this game impossible to recommend for the majority of audiences that want to play it for the first time.A few notes before the game critique:You can still resolve issues with Uplay by installing Uplay before downloading and activating this game through Steam.  There's some manual patching you need to do, but that does put off a large portion of the audience.  Pick it up if you're willing to put in the effort to get it working; as of late 2015, Ubisoft hasn't addressed any of the fundamental problems with getting it runningMake sure you have a machine you'll play through the entire game with, because this Steam version acts as one copy.  I can't play this copy anymore because I upgraded to Windows 10; and thus my previous machine (which I can't go back to) has this copy on it.  Make sure you've got it on a medium that Ubisoft trusts you to have it with, be it on Uplay originally or a physical copy.This is not the game for you if you don't have great internet.  If you lose access to Uplay servers, you could forfeit your current work even on the single-player campaign.The ProsAnno 2070 is a gorgeous addition to the series that adds a lot of addicting features.  Citizen management, faction alliances and tech research all feel much more interwoven than in previous titles, and given the futuristic asthetic, it seems pretty coherent.Though I don't think it was executed as well as it could have been, the story mode was very immersive and I found the real-world themes of industry vs environmentalism to be very engaging.  There's different styles you can set things up to appeal to the masses and obviously multitudes of methods to accomplish those means, which I found very encouraging for me to find my own solutions to problems I had (usually) brought upon myself.The ConsAs a first time player, this was really, really hard for me to get into.  I actually went back and played Anno 1503 to sort of understand what the game was asking for and to acquire a general feel for how it's played.  Thereafter, though I like the very high-tech and modern feel of the game, I don't think the intro or tutorial to the game were well done at all.  Having gone through it's predacessors, I struggled re-learning the specifics of new units and buildings, as well as having the map  awareness or sense of scale to do quests at apropriate times.  It's a very challenging game, and it mostly leaves itself for the player to figure out.My VerdictAnno 2070 is a game you likely won't play, and will regret not doing so.  Though it's built on the previous titles quite a bit, I don't think it inhibited my progress at any point and kept me coming back for more.  I ended up ""sinking"" many more hours in this installment than I did in 1503, and hope to play 2205 soon.8.25/10However in the current setup on Steam/Uplay, I do not recommend purchasing this game for the sake of your future playing it.  Anno isn't a game to be played for 5-10 hours and then put down - heavens no.  This is something that I find rivals Age of Empires, and you might end up sinking well over a hundred hours into it.  If you lose your copy (like I did) you would have been better off buying it somewhere else. ",171,65,1,18,21,2,28

												After beginning the download, it is now approaching 2 hours of just trying to get the game to start. First problem that really causes things to stick is that to play this, you must go through steam to go through Ubisoft's game portal UPlay. But the UPlay component that downloads from steam does not work. Do not use google to look for the Uplay log in because when you get to that security thing where you have to enter words or numbers in their picture (or spoken in the verbal challenge) , no matter how correct you answer, it responds as being wrong all the time. Instead you actually have to open your google or windows explorer and go to the Ubisoft Website and download the UPlay software from there. Then, running the Ubisoft site downloaded UPlay, set up your Ubisoft account. Then you can go to steam to launch Anno 2070 which just launches the Ubisoft environment where you again direct the Play of the game. Then there is another download for add-on updates, which adds to the length of time required of the start of play. Anyone seeking to obtain and play this game, perhaps getting the CD of this one might be easer. I can't recommend this game based on this as I have not even had the opportunity to play Yet. Look to other review for the actual game review because determining to buy the game should be based on quality of play. This is my first steam review so I don't know if I can edit this later as actual play experience occurs.			",1,3,0,1,14,0,9

Unfortunately I can't really review it properly because I have NEVER BEEN ABLE TO LOG IN TO UPLAY EVEN ONCE SINCE BUYING IT.  Uplay just says CD key in use, even though I'm logging into the exact same account that I made for the game.  I have been wanting to experience this game for YEARS and I paid full price for it.  I never knowingly bought another Ubisoft game since, as the way I see it, they literally just stole my money and ran with it.  Do yourself a favour and get the hell away from this garbage.

												I have to say this is the worst instance I have seen of failing to grasp the concept of Steam integration. This game is a mess of patchers. To start with, the entire game downloaded via Steam. When launched, a 3rd party patcher launched instead and patched. After that was done, UPlay installed and patched. Upon logging in to UPlay, I had to redownload the entire game because UPlay ignored my Steam install. Once the UPlay download completed the patcher launched once again and patched.Finally I get ingame only to find that any DLC owned is mandatory and not downloaded by default, so the game quits and reopens the patcher, downloads the DLC, reopens the game, sees another missing DLC, and downloads that. TEN TIMES.As such, I have yet to even reach the main menu and cannot review the gameplay at this time.			",400,131,10,37,78,3,65

												The game itself is vaguely fun and there's so much micromanagement but at the end of a game I dont feel like i've really influenced the victory - Just clicked along for the ride. The games pretty mediocre to be honest but what really swayed my negative was uPlay for one. While it worked mostly alright (only crashing once or twice) it was just unnecessary and should have been stripped from the game. The other reason was finding a game breaking bug in one of the missions which left me thinking I did something wrong. After googling it it seems to be a known fault from 2013. It's still not fixed.

												This game, first and foremost, is the most expansive, intricate city-builder I have ever played.  The number of structures, units, etc. is stunning.  There are three different, largely unique buildings tracks, each with their own style and appearance.  The fun part is mastering each and then using them together.  While the diplomacy and combat are somewhat rudimentary, they are adequate and add a further level of complexity to already intricate gameplay.  Moreover, it is a gorgeous game.  You will play this game for one hundred hours and still be amazed by it.The problem, of course, is getting past the first 5-10 hours.  This game has a very large learning curve and has almost no tutorial. What tutorial exists is a very bad one.  I believe this is why this game has received bad reviews in the past.Overall, I would recommend this game highly, if you have the endurance to learn its gameplay.  And I am writing this having not even purchased a single DLC.  I can’t wait to do so.			",79,7,0,22,10,0,27

												When i seen Anno 2070 on the steam sale, i was pretty happy. It appears to follow the path of the previous anno games which where great fun (even the one on the DS). However, i have not actually had the chance to play anno 2070 yet, due to the amount of time it took to update the game itself after download (expected). As i was greeted with the request for a serial key, i had to remind myself that it wasnt 2006 and that i did buy this game on steam (supposed to stop this), but ok, its only a few clicks ill roll with it. As i progressed though this, i was then greeted with a SECOND digital distrobution platform.. uplay. Hold on, did i not buy this game on steam? no uplay, uplay why are you updating.. ok ill wait. About 30 mins later, i was bored and lost a large chunk of my playtime for that session. A few days later i thought, hey uplay will be updated, ill give this another blast... uplay was not fully updated and took another 30 mins or so to get me updated. A which point i was greeted with a login screen within uplay... WHY is this game forcing me to sign into two platforms? TLDR: The game has a dual digital distribution, requireing two online accounts to use. Why? no idea. I will add, that i have not yet actually managed to play the game.			",51,20,0,24,47,0,44

												 I'm convinced that this game is just trolling us. Keep in mind after numerous hours of research into the game it seemed like the game I hab been searching for. But somehow the start up system made the whole idea of building a furturistic city fall apart. Ready for a screwed up system that won't let you log in? How about a ""help"" website that doesn't even work? Don't waste your time on this one, anno 2205 was likely a game to make us forget about this version, but if the devolpers would just let us play the game without going through a login process I'm sure anno 2070 would make a comeback. Until then the local content will remain inactive.			",7,1,0,1,6,0,2

												For those of us looking for a top notch economic simulator with a focus on strategic city building, Anno 2070 will scratch that itch and then some.  You'll be expanding accross a number of islands (and viable plots of ocean floor) on each map that produce and grow independently from one another which makes creating trade routes imperative if you hope to make them prosper in the long run.  A fun campaign injects a story and special objectives into the game, but the large number of maps available keeps Anno 2070 playable for a long time after that.Your colonies themselves have a lot of customization available as you would imagine with a city builder.  Three different population types are available each with their own unique perks that they can offer.  There are the money-obsessed, capitalism-loving Tycoons, the beauty and clean living Ecos, and the science fanatics known as the Techs.  Each has several tiers of classes to unlock within them as long as you meet their ever-growing list of demands.  Workers may not ask for much but executives will require a significant, continued supply of resources that will take some commitment to produce.Creating and maintaining trade routes requires a level of micromanagement but when you hit that sweet spot and start shipping the near-perfect quantity of a resource from your single colony that produces it to all of your colonies that use it to produce more advanced goods you feel an incredible sense of accomplishment.  Watching the economy thrive and grow after having built it from the ground up is fantastic feeling.I recommend this game to anyone and everyone who enjoys city builders and economy simulators.  This is easily one of the best ones that I have played.  Few games of the genre manage to reach the depth of Anno 2070 (pun intended?) and I still start the game up from time to time even having completed the campaign quite some time ago.

I went through 3 different log in processes. I owned the game on Uplay, but inside the game when I had to log in for a third time I had previously activated the game on some other unknown account (stupid on my part). All those steps shouldn't have been an issue though. Most other games you just open and play...			",158,16,1,16,14,0,17

Posted: July 16, 2015
												An incredibly intense city-building game with plenty of complex interactions.So, very first impression, yes this is an Ubisoft game, and yes that means using Uplay, and yes Uplay is a terrible client, but that should absolutely not prevent you from enjoying this fantastic creation of a game.Next impression I get is of Anno 2070's high aesthetics. The interface, setting, art, and music are all very appealing and I'd say downright immersive. Although this does bring my first real complaint that the interface did sacrifice a moderate amount of utilitarian value for the sake of aesthetics. Really what this boils down to is an extra button press or two to select the proper category of building, and also not as much information as I'd like to be displayed on the screen at all times. And then comes the initial campaign. Initially I was annoyed with the moving my boat back and forth to transport arbitrary quest objects, but later on I came to realize how important it was getting those basic mechanics mastered beforehand, before having to manage multi-island economies. In hindsight, the gradual pacing of the introduction of game mechanics was well done, even if it might not seem so at first.And then finally the meat and potatoes. For each game, the map is spread out across several different islands. Each island has ~3 different fertilities which allow for the production of their respective agricultural products. There are also a limited number of mineral nodes for other types of resources. As you develop your city, your people will want for goods far in excess of what their home island can produce. This is the key base point around where all the emergent interactions come from. You'll need to colonize other islands in order to have a more diverse selection of resources, and then you'll have to weight the pros/cons of refining those resources prior to or after shipping them, and then you'll have to setup trade routes in order to move the goods around to where they need to go, but in order to do that, you need to be able to build additional ships to throw at it. And all of this just falls under what I describe as the first order of complexity.The second order of complexity, is that when you're expanding, you're not only introducing demands for new forms of goods, but you're also increasing the quantity of demand for lower forms. This base principle creates this order of emergent complexity - resource balancing. You need to constantly be mindful of actions that you take introducing resource imbalances, and figuring out a solution to correct them. There is a ratio of resource gathering, to manufacturing, to demand, but it's never perfect and usually up to you to diagnose it before your people let you know by being upset. Proper management of imports/exports with other parties in the game can smooth out these resource imbalances as well.So now you've been on the same map for a dozen hours, and you've finally gotten your starting faction up to the highest level of development? Well there's 2 other factions that you unlock as you play, and they both have their own completely different resource trees. So all that balancing you were doing? Now you need to do that x3 across the same islands. And one of those factions, the Techs, have many dozens of different researches to do in late game to assist in optimizing your economy even further.Summed up,  what all of this means is that when you're playing, you're never ever waiting for your city to grow - you're constantly juggling half a dozen things at once for hours on end, and it's not even mundane. Deciding on optimal building placement, managing resource imbalances - these are not cognitively simple tasks.By the way, there's also a military aspect. There are other players in the world who can do the same sort of things you do, and you can declare war on them and blow their stuff up. Myself and many other Anno players haven't really fully plunged the depths of this, though, since the resource management can be cognitively taxing enough without this as well. Which also brings me to mention that there's also multiplayer support, but it's a very special kind of person who wants to throw human players into this mix.tl;dr, game is complex enough that I've put in over 50 hours and I'm still not all that comfortable with all the content that is presented to me.

												This was the single worst purchase I have made on Steam. I have Verizon Fios down here in Florida, which is a very fast and reliable internet provider for all of my needs, except UPLAY. UPlay is the worst DRM I have ever seen, I was too excited and didn't see the developer of the game before purchasing. I refuse to support Ubisoft due to their aggressive behavior towards consumers.I have not been able to play the game and despite hours of trying different fixes and appealing to the technical support team of this game over and over, I made no progress. In fact, I found that the tech support people were concerned with only one thing: Closing my work ticket. Did it matter if I solved my problem? No. As soon as someone repsonded via email to me, they closed the ticket without waiting to see if their advice would actually fix the problem. Single worst Steam experience.If you see ""Ubisoft"" as the developer, don't waste your money or time, and don't support an organization of cockroaches.			",65,8,0,26,26,0,26

												Like others have said, Ubisoft kills this game.  I bought it because it looked interesting, but after launching I'm now an hour in without even having played it yet.  You must create an account with Ubisoft's Uplay service, and sit through a seemingly endless barrage of updates and patches and activations and registrations and so forth.Other than that, I can't really comment on the game play, because I'm not sure if I'll ever actually get to play it.  To be honest, I don't even want to anymore.			",17,4,0,10,7,0,5

												When I bought this game, I didn't realise it had Uplay.When I opened it for the first time, it started this app called Uplay. I had to create an account with Uplay, which was inconvenient and I didn't want another account just to play this game.Then, after Uplay opened, I couldn't figure out how to start the game, so I quit Uplay, and clicked Play Game from Steam again.Then finally, Uplay launched, but it had to auto update. Then it asked me to add the game to my Uplay account. I already bought the game on Steam, why do I need to register it a 2nd time?Then again, nothing happened, Uplay was just sitting there, and I quit it. Then I clicked Play Game from Steam again. This time Uplay launched, then the game launched. Once in the game, it asked me for the product key, which I had to cut and paste from Steam. It told me that the game would be registered against my Uplay account, but haven't I already done that?Then, I had to create a profile in the game. The game then told me that it was installing some addons (???) and had to download them and restart. I clicked Okay, and the game promptly crashed (""Anno 2070 has stopped working"").I launched it from Steam again, which told me the game was already running. I found some weird updater GUI running minimised with some EULA agreement. Then on my (slow) internet connection, it took 1 hour to update (god knows what it was updating, don't I already have the game via Steam!?).Finally, I could launch the game and play it.I feel like I'm doing the work of the QA/Testing staff. What the ♥♥♥♥?			",218,39,5,22,29,0,34

												I was recommended this game by a friend of mine recently as I've been playing a lot of strategy/citybuilders. So far, I'm enjoying the scenario mode, I haven't played endless, MP or the individual missions but the only glaring issue I've found so far is lack of a real tutorial. The game prefers to throw information at you on an ""as and when"" basis, whereas I'm the kind of person who'd like a thorough run through of all the basics before I dive in. Still, that's nothing that would put me off as I'm a fairly fast learner, but I'm aware that there are those out there who might be put off by the level of complexity with just an in-game ""manual"" to refer to.The gameplay is what you'd expect from games of this type, functional point and click with plenty of micromanagement. I loved how simple it is to manage your resources and trade networks and to quickly sell off any of your stockpiled surplus to make a few quick dollars, I've never been very good at budgeting so that was quite a help when my depots started to fill up.Graphically, it's absolutely gorgeous to look at with some absolutey beautiful levels of detail (the fat guys working the sugar beet production plantation made me giggle a bit) on structures, vehicles, NPCs and landscape, the underwater areas have fish, rays, jellyfish and other marine creatures which makes exploration something very enjoyable.It sounds lovely too, a nice, non-intrusive score which nevertheless conveys the atmosphere of the game very well and the change of track from over- to underwater was a nice little touch. The NPCS voice actors are well chosen for their roles with my only criticism there being of Dr. Salman Devi.. where are you from, Davi?!I'd definitely give this a thumbs up to anyone familiar with strategy, citybuilding and suchlike. There are a wide range of expansions to keep you busy once you've cracked the game too which should push its longevity, definitely worth the money!			",46,19,0,20,7,0,9

												I am here after about 3 hours of getting the stupid game to work.  The game has three major points of failure. Here has been my process.Buy game through steam.Download and update through steam.Launching the game actually launches Ubisoft's terrible UPlay.Uplay then asks for the activation key, which I then enter.Uplay attempts to redownload the entire game. I cancel it.Uplay now has 2 entries in the games list for anno; one for steam and one I'd have to redownload.I click the other one, and it launches through steam (yes, steam launches uplay which launches anno through steam).Anno then decides to update. There are now 3 updaters for this ONE game.Anno launches, and once again asks for my cd key (why??) and for me to log into uplay (although I *launched* this from uplay).It crashed a few times after this, but finally it took my cd key and told me that I have to restart anno to access the DLC; it gave me no choice than to restart the game.I restarted the game, and it took several attempts to even connect to their server to download the DLC.In sum: This game will only  work if steam, uplay, and the anno servers ALL work and are responding, and the process of even activating and authenticating yourself as a customer is hell.I haven't even gotten to play the game yet, because I just spent 3 hours of jumping through DRM hoops.  Do not buy.			",168,16,2,15,8,0,27

												Anno 2070 is a great game that takes elements like city building, food production to air and sea combat with a futuristic them. The campain is ok, but doesn't utilise all the interesting things that vs ai does or multiplayer does. I personally don't like how certain AI wont attack each other at all and a wider variation of AI personalities would be cool,  Overall it's learning curve is good and takes a few hours to grasp.. great game if you like RTS, city building, and combat.

												I have bought Anno maybe around... 2014 now ?Since then I have played it for a few 100 hours and it's still enjoyable.When I bought the game originally , I wasn't aware of the DRM system Ubisoft used.I have used my key twice by now. In about 3 years.Let me get this straight.Ubisoft are plain scumbags for this method by treating you like a pirate.It's bad , it impacts the game but only on the long term.From the reviews I have read , people complain about changing their computer Specs often.I don't really mind that people like performance , but I never had these problems.I don't see why you would require to wipe out your Hard Drive often. Or why you would need to change your GPU or CPU often. I don't agree at all with Ubisoft's system. It's awful and shouldn't exist for such a great game.But 3 keys activation is enough , if you know how to be reasonable with a computer.So in the end , do I still recommend the game.Yes , absolutely , it's really great.Do I recommend using Uplay over Steam ? No because Steam is significantly better.It's acceptable though (their customer service is also far better).But what I'm warning you is that people make a bigger fuss about it than necessary. Considering Ubisoft won't even change.Simply be aware of what you buy , and make sure you're not getting ♥♥♥♥ed over.			",72,5,0,1,3,1,20

It looks good,the Soundtack is incredible,its a lot of fun andits not that easy to master (like 2205 was).The only thing which I wished for is more interactions with AI characters like Rufus Thorne or so.

												Despite having an annoying piece of broken bloatware that comes with it, the game itself is great. If you can manage your way past the firewall that is U-Play (fix explained in the last paragraph), you get a real-time near-future game that touches on city-building, resource management, and military actions.The simulations runs smoothly (so long as a few certain buildings stay in one piece, that is) and cities can grow and adapt depending on the play style of the player: both of the starting factions provide very different gameplay. Players can choose to be city designers, researchers, or military powers and win victories set by the match host.Although most of the game's missions are difficult at first sight, the campagin and single-player missions follow a plot line that is understandable and memorable. In addition, the game well incorperates ""today's global challanges"" with daily senate/council votes, world events (generally a mini-campaign that refreshes every month or so.), and lots of cool little features most people don't notices until later.My only complaints about this game are down to two things. Firstly, one of the game's earliest production chains, tools, requires the very resource it creates to build it. In general, the player has to store some aboard the Ark (an inter-game storage system) or order some in-game from the Ark's delivery system to start this production. Repairing U-Play:Secondly, the U-don't-play service that comes with the game is just... upsetting: it's buggy, it's slow, and serves no extra purpose over using plain Steam. Aditionally, it will almost always crash on and machines that aren't Windows XP SP2. That said, if your game does fail to start: right click on the game in your library and browse local content. First, right click Anno5.exe and view Properties. Next, navagate to the Compatability tab and set the game to run in compatability mode for Windows XP Service Pack 2 and have it run as administrator. Steam will show that the game launched then immediately closed: give it a moment for U-Play to start and the game to launch shortly after.			",54,7,0,4,11,1,6

												Uplay DRM can be a hassle, but once you get past that and the learning curve it results in a great game that is loads of fun.Edit - Now I know this isn't ideal at all, but if you have trouble starting up after update like me, you have to let uplay do its thing, then exit out and restart anno 2070 from the steam menu. Pressing play on Uplay after update doesn't seem to work for me, I can not comment on others.			",129,22,1,25,22,0,41

												Great game, but completely umplayable. UPLAY is the most un-user friendly interface possible. If you do manage to get to the game itself, you better hope your computer is up to snuff, since it is very graphics-intensive. That is, of course, assuming you can get to the game. because it WILL crash. A lot.			",11,2,0,5,2,0,24

												Back when I played Anno Dawn of Discovery, I loved it. Years went by and I forgot about that game. Now, while I was scrolling through the steam shop, I saw this game. I loved the other one, so why not get this one! Well, I'll tell you why, UPlay. I bought this game through steam, but it wants me to download UPlay so I can play this game! And it is terrible. I tried to play this game for 1 hour, but whenever I tried to, UPlay would crash before I could ever open the acual game. If you want to deal with UPlay, by all means buy this game. But if you are a normal person, and don't want to deal with UPlay's♥♥♥♥♥♥ don't buy the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game will take chunks out of your spare time and consume them until it's the next morning when you look away from the screen. Build your cities, take over islands and create a stable economy. Survive against the harsh enviroment changes as you turn the green islands into either even greener or into grey industrial dumps. Manage your resources and protect your caravans as your opponents do the same.The game itself is very slow but rewarding the further you go. Single misstakes will turn your production chains into dust so be careful.Pro: Fun and rewarding experience Con: Extremly time consuming to get anywhere ",550,104,16,70,77,7,127

												I bought this game about a year and a half ago during the steam summer sale of 2013. I enjoyed the game at first, and learned about U-Play.... If I enjoyed it then why did I not recommend the game? I don't reccomend the game because I think that the core gameplay is dis-functional, and it's mostly notices after various games. This is a long review but in-depth. Read on for more info.Engine:Let me start out by saying that ever time, before i launch the game, i have to validate the game files or else the game crashes randomly. I looked it up and this is a known engine bug that existed in the last Anno games as well. Ubisoft must not have thought that the game-breaking bug needed to be fixed. (Remind you of any recent Ubisoftness)-Pros/Cons:+ It CAN work----- Bad Engine-- CrashesGeneral Gameplay:Let me start out by noting there are two player factions which change looks and core gameplay. Power production and even the resources you need to get to the new tiers change. I only have played with the Tycoons since they are my style but they both look fun. I've never taken the time to play extensively with the Initative. More details can be found below on each aspect of gameplay.++ Diversity- Resources:The gameplay is supply chain and resource production. You build your iron mines, smelt it into steel, and then produce tools from the steel. Managing the buildings, citizens, supply and demand, food, and fleet can be a challenge at times. If you are into micro managing things than you're probably going to like the gameplay.-Pros/Cons: ~Meh+- Supply chain+- Management-Economy:The problems arise in balance however. You start out with little money, barely enough to get your island under control and produce more. Often the money ammount is so low i cannot get the revenue i need, even through trading, to keep my island running smoothly, so that has made me loose many times. The money will make you loose more often than a war.-Pros/Cons: ~OH MY GOD HELP ME!!!!--- Horrible economic start, you start behind-- You'll keep encountering money issues until the late game+ More citizens = more taxes = more money- Diplomacy-War:Speaking of war, war is bad. The AI start with a fully developed Island and fleet, not you however. This screws with the balance. Ships can really only start to be made in the mid-game, and AI has a fleet in the beggining. Even when you get the materials to make ships (supply chain) you can not make much ships. If by this point you have done something horrible, like building a building that makes the AI mad at you (more on this in a little bit), it's game over. Ships are so hard to build at the start i've only ever had one game where I could even produce ships, but I only ever made two because of the budget (money issues again). Im not sure how well balances war is if everyone has ships, i've never had more than one attacking ship.-Pros/Cons: ~Dunno, I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO WAGE WAR!----- Horribly unbalanced, game ruining-- AI always ahead-- Hard to make any fleet to defend-- money needed to do anything cool with a fleet++ no excessive micro managing during battles-Diplomacy:If you ever try and use diplocy you will be mad. Diplomacy isn't like civ where your trading resouces, it's just you paying the AI for services, like delaying another AI, not expanding, ect.. The prices are steep so you'll most likely never have the money you need to do what you want done until the end game (more spending). If you're in the end game I don't see why you would nbeed their services though. As I mentioned earlier, the only actual diplomacy is where you do something that pisses the AI off and they send you a threat. You have two options, follow through with the demands or declare war. YAY for options.... If you actually have a fleet by the time you receive the threat you might be able to fight.-Pros/Cons: ~Never used-- Useless+-- AI Threats!! Example: I needed oil to start a new production line and get to the next tier, so I expanded and build oil wells. Then I receive a threat from the oil baron AI, ""Destroy all your oil wells and production or declare war."" I couldn't destroy my oil without consequences and didn't have the money to just buy his oil (More economy issues, again) so I was forced to declare war. I thought it would't be that bad and he'd just leave me alone mostly, but he charged in with high level warships and leveled my main island...Island colonization:I actually liked this gameplay aspect. You can colonize other islands and produce good that can't be grown on your main island (depending on the island). Then you can create an automated trade route to exchange resources. The only problem is that you need a cargo ship, so one will always be busy. If you want to trade also you'll need at least two cargo ships or to stop the transport temporarily. If you need two ships you'd better be able to build the second one, so you'll need money (wow, more money needed. Cargo ships are the easiest ships to make though). If you chose to repurpose the main ship then it can stop the production chain which can cause unhappy citizens and then tax problems leading to a ruined economy in the long run (...). -Pros/Cons: ~I Enjoyed it++ Different islands+ You can intercept transports to ruin a players economy (works both ways)+ Underwater islands (This is more late game so i've never been able to use them)- Could maybe use even more island diversityGraphics:Now since im over with the gameplay let go into graphics. Not too bad actually. Futuristic looking, of course, so sleek building and interesting vehicles. Good graphics overall.Pros/Cons: ~Good++ Futuristic+ Nice looking islandsSound:It's been a while since I've played and I mostly forget the sounds of the game, but I don't remember anything annoying me so thats a big plus. All i remember is that I liked itPros/Cons: ~?++ Nothing annoying+ It worksThe Verdict:Buy this game if the gameplay is your style, you could enjoy it more than me.-For me though 5/10.

												No. Just, no.This game is gorgeous. It has a fun atmoshpere. It promises cool city building with a focus on trading, resource management and tech. It is blindingly tedious and complicated. And not the challenging kind of complicated, the, ""What in the holy heck does the game want me to do to advance?!!!"" kind of complicated. This game is so frustrating becaue it really is the most beautiful and polished turd on the market for the building sim genre. You will love it for an hour, and then struggle to find enjoyment the next 8 or so before you finally realize this game has nothing to offer beyond tedious resource grinding for ever-decreasing gains. I want to like this game so hard. The premise, the gloss, even parts of the gameplay, but I just cannot recommend it. Especially after Steam and Uplay had a battle on my hard drive and installed it twice (only game thats ever done that). But that actually worked out for the best, because now when my friends ask, ""How is ANNO 2070?"" I can honestly reply, ""It's so bad I deleted it twice!"" EUIV, Civ V, SimCity, even CitiesXL (which has no trading) will offer a better experience. tl;dr: A very pretty, very polished trading sim with terrible gameplay mechanics and incredibly low replay value.

												Anno 2070 is an extremely complex city builder. The game is very fun and very addictive ""the feeling of just doing one more quest before turning in"" is a huge fact. It has a terrible introduction system but after you get the ropes it is an awesome game. I've invested hundreds of hours into this game. The only down side is the lack of Multiplayer or updates but I guess that is to be expected of Ubisoft.			",69,3,0,5,6,1,5

												They totally destroyed the Anno series with these futuristic settings and mechanics. The original Anno was one of the best builder games of all time. Why they decided to change things so radical is beyond me. Why fix something that ain't broken. I really hope they have learned their lesson now, with the two latest Anno games getting so low ratings. PLEASE GO BACK TO YOUR ROOTS. No need to reinvent the series.			",36,15,0,18,9,0,15

												A disappointing sequel to Anno 1404 (Dawn of Discovery) which, in my opinion, doesn't add enough to the previous game to be justified.  Features such as the underwater islands are an interesting touch, but there is little that you can actually do with them.  Everything else about the game is just Anno 1404 with a few new building types and new names for everything.  I'm all for sequels to good games sticking with the format that works, but they have to add enough content to justify their price tag, and this one didn't.As if to add insult to injury, the game also REQUIRES Ubisoft's UPlay launcher to start the game, which REQUIRES you to have a UPlay account (yet another username and password) and be always connected to the internet.  Aside from the fact that I object to this type of publisher account where it adds no value to the game for the consumer, but the software itself is unreliable and often fails to connect or crashes before I can even play the game.  Not to mention that this is on top of the existing TAGES DRM which imposes the 3 machine activation limit that was present in Anno 1404.All in all, I would recommend people play Anno 1404 (with the Venice expansion pack) instead and save themselves the heavy price tag and immense frustration for a game that adds little to the fantastic Anno series.

												As much fun as this game offers.  From a classic revisit to building a city, managing your population happiness, jobs and power.  In the end I would NOT recommend this game. Were it not for the Ubisoft log in requirment just to play the game I would recommend this to everybody.  But after going through two months with Ubisoft with just trying to get the game to work and find out what my log in email was, the game just isn't worth buying or playing.Any game that has you go through loop after loop of red tape just too play teh game you paid teh price for, isn't worth playing at all.  Ubisoft's need too create an account for gaining achievements ruins the chance of enjoying the game in it's entirty.			",107,32,1,19,33,0,41

												Honestly, the game is fine.Too bad I can't play it because despite Anno 2070 being registered to my uPlay account it still asks for my ""one-time"" activation key and rejects it.I can't play this game at all because Ubisoft still thinks it's okay to terrorize the gaming community with its atrocious business practices.So yes, if you don't want a dead game in your library I recommend against buying this steaming pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥			",399,107,5,78,76,4,116

												I used to play this game but now I can't because of the launcher consistently crashing. It was a good game but really crappy DRM. Kind of ironic when your DRM is so horrible that it is less of a hassle for people to pirate your game than actually play a version they would pay for. Get rid of the buggy UPLAY launcher. Stop with the horribly invasive and resource hogging DRM software.			",77,8,0,12,22,0,18

												I made the mistake of ignoring the other negative reviews of this game. Don't follow my example. I have read several reviews detailing that the game itself is excellent. I wish I knew if that is true, but I couldn't get to the actual game. To get to the game you need to get through Ubisoft, and they are a determined door guard. For me, the Ubisoft log-in crashed every time I tried to access the game. I couldn't even make it to the title menu! Please, send Ubisoft a message that this is unacceptable.

												I really want to love this game. I remember buying it when it came out and ive come back to it every now and then. My lack of hours is from playing it through ubisoft... and its the most crap-tastic client there is. Ubisoft has heavy DRM and you can only install it 3 times. After that you have to CALL THEM and they wont give you a new code unless you want to buy it. I wipe my HDD every 6 months. Get over it Ubisoft.

												This is one of the best strategy games I've played. Got the complete edition on sale and got my friends to get it also and it has been really fun. It has a lot of neat elements to it and is complex enough to stay interesting and not be overly complicated to the point where it's not fun. The graphics are really nice in my opinion, especially when you go underwater and build cool stuff on underwater plateaus. It's really fun with 4 players but you can play with more if you're willing to co-op with another person, bringing the count up to 8 players.The factions in the game are very different so the gameplay really changes with each, but late game you are able to unlock all of the other factions which is cool too. My main complaint about the factions is that if you pick the Eco faction and you are playing against an agressive tycoon, you likely won't be able to defend yourself for a while so you have to figure out other ways to protect your islands.I really like this game, give it a try!

												Steam has tracked 57 minutes of this game and all of it has been from downloading the required UPlay client (Steam clone) and attempting to activate the game. Hitting ""Play"" in Steam launches the UPlay client, not the game, which you must then click play again. I even had to enter the product key twice, once in UPlay and once in Anno 2070. It finally crashed to desktop after it said it had to quit to download even more content once I managed to get it activated and locked to my new manditory UPlay account. It's patching now (protip, Ubisoft: that's what Steam is for) for what I assume is the final time. I will be avoiding Ubisoft games in the future if this is going to be kind of experience I'm going to have.			",466,145,27,75,83,5,79

												Game is great. ""Uplay"" is terrible.Here some steps I made to make game running:1. Installed the game in steam.2. Pushed the ""Play now"" button.3. Some stuff started to setup, including ""Uplay""... waiting for it to finish... Ooops, looks like it was an old version of uplay and its updating now... So much popup windows... miserable waiting and suffering.... wasting tons of time... aaaaand done at last!4. Tryin to get in Uplay. Recovering password for Uplay. I actually forget that I used uplay in past. Game serial number copy-pasting...5. Uplay opened, but ""My games"" list is empty! How should I play???6. Trying to restart the game. Clicking X button in right-upper corner of Uplay window. Pressing ""Play now"" in steam again. Noooooooooo, its not working! It says that game is already running. Whaat? Looks like uplay is still running. Trying to switch to window with uplay. But it does not exist!!! No Uplay application is running. There is only a uplay process in memory, so I had to kill it in bad way, like crushing you know. Some casual users don't know how to end process, so it should not be that way, Ubisoft. Actually you should not end any process at all to start the game. We are trying to START, not to END.7. Pushed the ""Play now"" button in steam again.8. At last uplay started, and its even showing Anno 2070 at ""My games"" page! Great success!9. Pushed the ""Play"" button in Uplay window.10. It works!!! But asking to enter serial number again. I've done it before, why do you ask it again?! Ok, paste it with facepalm.11. Popup message. You know, you just activated an addon for that game! So you have to download it now. And of course the game will now be ended and the updater will start working... WHAAAAAAAAT??? Ubisoft, let me play please!!! Today, preferable... Okay, updating...12. Starting the game again. Popup window ""please take a part in our survey"". Too much popups, I mean it... I know its not mandatory, but let's do what the game wants right now - let's go through the survey... And the second question is about how you rate Anno 2070. Guys I’ve been in main menu only, how may I rate it? 5 of 10 is ok for you? There are more obviously illogical questions about game concepts, which I could not know from being in main menu. At the end of survey they say thanks and site language turns into german. Danke, auf wiedersehen!13. Okay, lets play. Or not, because there is one more popup window. It describes anno online (different game) and has ""play now"" button. Seems like they want to distract me from playing anno 2070 at all costs!14. Finally we are able to push buttons in main menu like play scenario etc. I feel violated. And not in a good way. And I paid for that.			",131,24,4,11,23,1,27

												First off.... Uplay.I know, I know, it's a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ but it's mostly because Steam doesn't bother to update it (with good reason). The updates made by the launcher itself dont work, which means that you just have to download uplay off of Ubisoft. A 3 minute effort for hours of fun with a really nice game.Dont listen to the negative reviews my friends, please, Uplay isn't that much of a hassle, and definitely shouldn't hinder your decision to buy.Anno Anno Anno.I loved the game. It's just hilariously fun to build up your island as a tycoon or tech and then decide you want to nuke everyone else. Loved those aspects of it. City building is fun and difficult, ensuring an interesting experience, and campaign seems quite entertaining too. The lore, which I have not really gone into much lately, is interesting on the surface, and I especially like the conflict between Tech, Tycoon, and Eco.Combat is interesting, with each faction sporting strengths and weaknesses, and I LOVE the whole submarine side of it, really recommend the DLC and all. Diplomacy is OK, but I've only scratched the surface and all, since I'm currently sanctioned by, let's check, every single faction on the map, because of my avid use of nuclear warheads. The islands I conquer are currently glass, but I think that I can monopolize on the cathedral building business.10/10 Would play again ",104,16,0,14,15,0,26

												I have played this game extensively as you can see by my hours played. The Anno series is unique and unlike other city building games. Anno is all about micro managing and making sure your islands have the correct resources while balancing production buildings. Once your citizens are satisified, they can level up into a more prestigous catergory which will require more needs to satisfy the upper class. The game has awesome graphics, its very pleasing to the eyes.The DRM used to be a lot worse than what it currently is. Don't let that hold you back from getting this game, its well worth the price. I paid full price for it but grabbed the DLC when it was on sale. The Deep Ocean DLC is worth if once you understand the mechanics of Anno. I also must note that the game has quite the multi player options. I found it very confusing and never used it, just always played Campaign. Some important campaign tips: Google good map seed numbers to get good maps that are very big and have lots of mines / rivers / resources / etc. Discover and inhabit as many islands as possible right away. If not, the AI will get it develop it to kick your♥♥♥♥♥at war. Keto is ♥♥♥♥♥. Hector is annoying but easy to beat as a beginner. Always check your productions lines are working correctly and you don't have huge shortages or surplases. Trading Carbon/Kerosene is the fastest and easiest way to get money fast.Hope this helps!

												TL;DR Get game, get Deep Sea expansion. Tech trees/balancing at 3 to 4 levels of supply is really satisfying. Graphics/detail = great. Combat = Sucks. Yes, UPlay sucks but it is not enough of a reason to avoid altogether. If you like city building strategy games, you need to check this out, ESPECIALLY if you can get it on deep discount. 8.5/10OK first of all, I do not have 830 hours on this game because that is ridiculous. Lots of hours tabbed out. I would say I have probably played 200+ hours though, no joking. After finishing the campaign and several lengthy custom games, I confidently recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun strategy/builder with a lot of depth. The Deep Sea expansion is a MUST HAVE. It is definitely an ""Oh♥♥♥♥♥♥I have to work in 3 hours!""-kind of a game.Second: A little background on me so you can put my review in context. I like a wide variety of games, but I play a LOT of strategy games. I started out on Master of Orion and XCom UFO Defense. I played Ogre Battle 64, Sim City 2000, XCom Enemy Unknown, Master of Orion 2, Civilization 5, Banished, Sim City 5. I am currently playing Endless Legend and getting back into Galactic Civilizations 2. 95% of strategy games I play to completion at least once. I feel that that is a decent background in the strategy genre and that it was worth mentioning to know if you want to take me seriously or not.UPlay: Yes, thank you every other reviewer who covered how UPlay is the reason we can't have nice things and the general end of gaming as we know it. I agree that this type of license control is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and it should go away. That being said, I had very few issues with the DRM in this game aside from a few save bobbles related to Internet connectivity. Lesson learned: If you notice your Internet drop out, DON'T LEAVE THE GAME UNTIL IT RECONNECTS, otherwise you will lose progress. That is all I have to say on UPlay because I feel that it has been adequately addressed elsewhere.Progression: Honestly, I think the progression aspect of this game, not just in terms of achievements, but in terms of the items and supplies that you can carry through successive games with you, is my favorite part of this experience. I am sure that other titles have employed this mechanism before, but it does make you feel more driven to keep playing. If there is a point at which you hit ""Auto Win"" because of all of the crap that you roll over, especially on higher difficulties, that point must be HUNDREDS of hours in because I didn't get there.Missions: I really appreciate the addition of the periodic missions that pop up before you enter a game. I think that these add some variety to the campaign missions and allow a player to change up the approach to a tough mission in some cases. They are a bit repetitive, and though some are simple ""fetch quests"", they definitely require an extra level of micromanagement in a lot of cases.Factions: I agree with some other reviewers that there could have been more factions; however, if you go in with the understanding that there are the Eco's and Industrialists, this is not detrimental.Min/maxers: I believe you will really enjoy this game. As of this writing, the Complete Edition is $12.50. Just buy it. The sale goes for another 34 hours!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm already sorry I bought this game and I didn't even play a single minute.Here's what happens if you buy and install the game on Steam: 1. Steam downloads the game. 2. You start the game using Steam.(Note: This is where you would normally start playing the game) 3. The Anno2070 launcher opens up, downloading stuff (again). 4. You are asked to register your CD key. 5. Ubisoft's uplay client starts up. 6. YOU HAVE TO CREATE A UPLAY ACCOUNT TO PLAY THIS GAME. THERE IS NO WAY AROUND THIS. 7. uplay starts downloading stuff (again²) 8. An installer pops up, installing the game (wtf?) 9. You start the game using uplay. 10. The Anno2070 launcher pops up DOWNLOADING STUFF FOR THE FOURTH TIME. 11. The game launches. (Yay!) 12. The game realizes I bought the complete edition, closes and puts me back to the Anno2070 launcher. The launcher DOWNLOADS STUFF FOR THE FIFTH TIME. 13. The game launches again. I guess I can play. On the plus side: The game prompts me with a survey asking me how I like the experience. Ha ha.I'm♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and I will not recommend this game even if the gameplay itself would be the greatest revelation of my life. I'm using Steam. Not Origin, not uplay, not you-name-it. I want the game and DLCs downloaded in as few steps as possible.Valve, I am deeply disappointed that this game is even for sale here. Other games were disqualified for much less, so please slap Ubisoft for this crap.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the first Anno game I've played.  I used to play Pharaoh and Caesar way back when, and this game brought back a lot of memories of hours spent building ancient cities.  I had a lot of fun with Anno, it's city building but more technical than SimCity, with more complexity within your control.  Mostly comes down to supply chain management, which the game does make rather difficult to maintain.  Still a fun game, but weird to think that most of the challenge is created by the lack of a good visibility into your supply chain.  I used to work on supply chain management software, so I understand the importance of having good visbility into your resource availability, which lets you leverage your vertical synergy across your extended enterprise.  Or whatever.			",292,90,4,58,37,5,62

I needed to download the game again, this time through UPLAY. Why is this necessary? So after downloading, I needed to install the game again. This is getting ridiculous. SO after an HOUR AND A HALF Anno needed autopatching again, then again, then once more. Now after 2 grueling HOURS I can play; Problem is, now I don't want to.Anno is a good game, nohing against Anoo.But, ♥♥♥♥ YOU UPLAY! What a miserable POS program this is.

												Anno 2070 is a game which nearly deserves its own genre. A mixture of Total Annhiliation-style warfare and epic scale, with the micromanagement of Sim City, and the trading aspects of an empire management sim. It does so many things right, that it will just suck out your free time, like a black hole.The Tycoons are the remainder of the present-world high-industrial, short-term, high-profit, fast-building race; which have significant advantages in the early game as well as military, but struggle in the late game.The Ecos are a future-gazing civilization which try to maintain and raise their ""ecobalance"" (the general health of an inhabited island). They are more difficult to learn, but more rewarded overall as they have beautiful architecture, and their late-game resource demands are significantly less difficult to micro-manage than the Tycoons. They do suffer from certain technology lacks- namely the Tycoon's nuclear reactors, and battleships.The Techs and other races are ""spoilers"", so I'll let you discover their benefits and drawbacks on your own.Overall, Anno 2070 is highly worth the purchase, especially when it's on sale. Go grab the Complete Edition ($12 as of this writing).			",173,44,4,29,24,2,35

												Anno 2070 is my introduction to the series, I have not played any of the others.The Premise of Anno is simple, the world has flooded, you take the lead of one of two ideals of how things should work (Eco, or Tycoon) and you build up the world from there.  A third, science like organization unlocks later regardless.But Anno is an awesome title, the game play is city building/god game, that rellys much more on trade and management of trades, that isn't really found in most games.  You need to establish trade routes to ferry supplys from one island to another, to unlock more trees and get the full extent of everything you need.The ARK allows you to manipulate the world further to your liking.I highly recomend this title.

												This is one of the best strategy games I've ever played. It's possible to play a relaxing game where you can build multiple cities and balance your production chains or an intense game competing with other players to gain control of valuable resources across multiple islands.If you've played any of the Caesar or older Anno games then this game should be easy to pick and play however for newer players they'll be a bit of a learning curve but once you figure out how to start controlling resources without everything going to hell in a hand basket you'll be able to enjoy hour upon hour of city building fun.I should probably also mention the DRM:TAGES and UPlay are their usual PITA so please take that into consideration before purchasing this game but as long as you're not swapping GPUs every five minutes it shouldn't be an issue.

												I've yet to play the game as of yet. But I thought that it was imperative to explain to all those who have had uPlay crash during game start up (like I did).First time I ran the game, I was surprised with the length of setup. Then when uPlay finally loaded it crashed. So I ran it again, low and behold crash!Being the determined IT Tech that I am, I browsed to the default UBISoft install folder that uPlay gets installed (much to my dislike it is in C:\Program Files but what ever).Right click 'Run as Administrator', no crash!So, in order to fix the issue, uPlay just needs to be elevated into Administrator mode. Most software does this automatically, in this case you can just edit the properties of the uPlay exe to run as administrator every time.			",79,51,0,6,8,3,24

												This game is a lot of fun but only if you have a lot of patience. While slow in progression it does take a lot of forethought and a good strategic mind to create a stable, and growing economy. It also seems to have a hidden message that one should not rely on one faction alone but work towards a more harmonic society.			",523,101,40,73,65,3,76

												This is my sim city killer. Although it may not have the exact same elements it does bring in an interesting naval combat ability. I really like the way the building feels and placing things the way you want feels easy. This is important since the islands you settle can be small. The vaarious production chains you have to mange are awesome and the trade routes are excellent. All around I would recommend this game to anyone who would rather not play simcity because EA is trash.			",154,5,3,24,21,0,18

												It's a sad day, the day I have to give an anno game a thumbs down. Having sunk over a hundred of hours into Anno 1404 - Venice I was really looking forward to a fresh start in this game, set in a different time with different, new, obstacles to overcome. Unfortunately I could not find anything that would make me want to play this game more. Nothing that would keep me awake for hours planning trading routes in order to build even greater cities. It is not a bad game, though. The visuals, the sound effects and music are, as for every Anno game, stunning. I really enjoyed the couple hours I spent playing I just didn't feel like playing more of it.			",148,15,1,12,7,0,12

												After purchasing and installing this game I attempted to log in only to recieve the message ""Uplay launcher has stopped working"".  The error dialog has no further explaination of what action to take and only permits you to close it.  I am left unable to play this game.EDIT: After three days I got a reply from Ubisoft customer support with instructions on how to re-install the Uplay launcher.  For some reason all of the slash characters in the email were removed (or invisible) which made links and paths to registry entries difficult to decipher.  After some difficulty I got the Uplay launcher working which resolved my issue and allowed the game to run.For all the good work the game devs did on the actual game it's a shame that the Uplay launcher is as shoddy a piece of work as it is.  I'm not anti-DRM as long as it does NOT get in the way and is PROPERLY MAINTAINED AND SUPPORTED.  Telling customers to hand edit their registry is a VERY BAD idea.  That sort of thing is the entire reason for installers, updaters, and launchers.Bottom line: I enjoy the gameplay but the mediocre customer support and sloppily designed and maintained launcher / DRM has damaged my respect for Ubisoft.  Since I finally got it working I'm happy enough to play the game but even with that if I had the option for a refund I'd take it.			",39,1,0,7,7,0,1

												The game is a great one. The details in the movement of resources as well as taxes and other monetary management are flawless, and the warfare between factions or yourself make the game even more enjoyable. After the campaign, I thought this game would have no replay value, but I was dead wrong. The game is fun no matter how many times you play it. Overall, it's a great game.One thing I'd like to address, however, is Ubisoft's loader program, UPlay. Let me just say that the program is total $hit. You cannot use it for anything, as it won't even get past the login screen. For those of you who hate it as much as I do, try to run it in compatibility mode or as an Administrator, as that works (sometimes.) If it wasn't for that program, Anno 2070 would be the ideal game for the average RTS-loving player. Trust me, it's worth the money, but if you hate technicalities, then you might waht to stay away from this, and all Ubisoft games altogether.			",63,10,0,8,11,1,18

												Bought this for the wife and I, both fans of city building games. Took us the good part of an hour to get it downloaded and past all the launchers and account logins. This is all separate from Steam.Once we were finally in game I found the menus extremely confusing. I just wanted to start a random map that we could play cooperatively to learn the game. By looking at the menus you would never know if this was possible but after watching a youtube video I saw that it was. While trying to do this something happened with their u-play service and it showed us both offline and unavailable to play so we couldn't join a game.Needless to say after about an hour and a half of trying to get INTO a game we shut it off. Perhaps I'll try another time.			",66,3,0,4,3,0,7

												Foreword: I don't recommend this game because of draconian-DRM and Ubisoft's involvement. It's a great game if you're willing to put up with that and the fairly high pricetag, but I cannot in good conscience recommend it to anyone. While Anno 2070's gameplay is solid and has a ton of replay value, Ubisoft takes a large dump all over it. I hope you like using two forms of DRM while trying to play this game. Yeah that's right, you gotta launch another DRM client that's similar to steam just to play this game. Absolutely sickening. About the gameplay: To put it vaguely it's like if you took Starcraft II and Sim City and combined the two. It's primarily a city builder game but it takes place in a real time strategy environment where you're sort of competing with other players, usually AI computer opponents because this game kind of blows as a multiplayer game, to become wealthy and technologically advanced. You start as one of two races, either industry-heavy or ecologically-friendly, then choose an island to settle on and begin building your city. Later on you can acquire a third-party race which is technologically-heavy to satisfy the end-game technologies, and you can actually have all three types of people at the same time. The tech tree for the game is pretty big, I've played for over 100 hours (65 of those hours were on Steam) and I still have not seen everything in the game.Due to randomization, different factions, lots of strategies and different AI personalities to play with/against, the game can be played in a variety of ways and has a lot of replay value. Unfortunately I feel Anno is somewhat hindered by the lack of mod-support, because after you've played with the same AI personality a few times you're kind of sick of them and there's only so many of them. The randomization of islands is also kind of limited and not as incidental as I'd hoped for. You begin to see patterns and everything feels really samey after hour 40. I really wish the Anno series overall was more mod-friendly.If you love city-building, resource management, setting up trade routes, etc. then the game can be pretty fun. The RTS-style combat is not even worth bothering with. If you dominate the map by starting wars it'll get boring really fast because the computers can never put up a good fight -- unless you set them to ""Hard"" difficulty which causes them to obliterate you in the first few minutes of the game with air units before its even possible to get air units (they get infinite resources and can make anything anytime they want regardless of tech tree restrictions), and that's even more boring to deal with.All in all, I really love this game, and it has quickly become one of my all-time favorite City Builder games. I just wish it had better mod-support, and less Ubisoft.Rating: B+			",41,5,0,3,10,1,9

												Pretty game. But it's boring. I really wish I could get the same out of it that others that gave it thumbs up got out of it. A few hours after you get an idea of how everything works together it gets dull quick. It sorta feels like they took something that's more complicated and dumbed it down a bit. Like when they port a popular game to mobile. Something is missing.Also from reading some of the other reviews I remember that this game uses Uplay. If I recall I had to do something fancy just to get the dang thing to run. That alone is worth a thumbs down.

Ultimate turn off for newcomers. 2)-Anno 2070 campaign is also utterly bugged, I encountered at least a script error per campaign mission, forcing to retry any given mission from scratch in order to find workarounds to complete objectives.Anno 2070 was certainly a good idea, to this day, it still has gorgeous visual and enthralling ambiance, but unfortunately it has been spoiled by poor polishing and  bug testing.

The UI is counter-intuitive, and I found myself frustrated as a push character yells at you to complete poorly-specified tasks for which the means to do so are completely unclear.

I really wish the Anno series overall was more mod-friendly.If you love city-building, resource management, setting up trade routes, etc. then the game can be pretty fun. The RTS-style combat is not even worth bothering with. If you dominate the map by starting wars it'll get boring really fast because the computers can never put up a good fight -- unless you set them to ""Hard"" difficulty which causes them to obliterate you in the first few minutes of the game with air units before its even possible to get air units (they get infinite resources and can make anything anytime they want regardless of tech tree restrictions), and that's even more boring to deal with.All in all, I really love this game, and it has quickly become one of my all-time favorite City Builder games. I just wish it had better mod-support, and less Ubisoft.Rating: B+			",41,5,0,3,10,1,9

												Bought this for the wife and I, both fans of city building games. Took us the good part of an hour to get it downloaded and past all the launchers and account logins. This is all separate from Steam.Once we were finally in game I found the menus extremely confusing. I just wanted to start a random map that we could play cooperatively to learn the game. By looking at the menus you would never know if this was possible but after watching a youtube video I saw that it was. While trying to do this something happened with their u-play service and it showed us both offline and unavailable to play so we couldn't join a game.Needless to say after about an hour and a half of trying to get INTO a game we shut it off. Perhaps I'll try another time.			",66,3,0,4,3,0,7

												Pretty game. But it's boring. I really wish I could get the same out of it that others that gave it thumbs up got out of it. A few hours after you get an idea of how everything works together it gets dull quick. It sorta feels like they took something that's more complicated and dumbed it down a bit. Like when they port a popular game to mobile. Something is missing.Also from reading some of the other reviews I remember that this game uses Uplay. If I recall I had to do something fancy just to get the dang thing to run. That alone is worth a thumbs down. I mean if it were a 10/10 type of game it would be worth the trouble but this game isn't.			",39,6,0,5,7,0,7

												This game has awesome graphics and lots of the background stuff is done on its own.  So one doesn't have to go to everey house and upgrade it.  When the conditions are met they upgrade themselves.However, the game progresses at a crawl.  After a while I stopped playing because the levels were taking so long and I was getting frusterated.   Managing different islands at once and the shipping routes can get overwhelming really quick.			",142,40,0,36,17,2,11

There's also an in-depth trade system and resource acquisition system. It's seriously a must-have, especially if you like games like Sim City, Dwarf Fortress, any RTS game, or EVE Online.

												This is my sim city killer. Although it may not have the exact same elements it does bring in an interesting naval combat ability. I really like the way the building feels and placing things the way you want feels easy. This is important since the islands you settle can be small. The vaarious production chains you have to mange are awesome and the trade routes are excellent. All around I would recommend this game to anyone who would rather not play simcity because EA is trash.			",154,5,3,24,21,0,18

												People seem to have issues with Uplay when running this game. I did too, and it was frustrating, but if you google ""uplay launcher has stopped working"" you should be able to find a fix. One video in particular showed me that you run the uplay program as an admistrator and stop uplay from using a proxy to access the internet then this should fix the problem. Yes, Uplay is absolute garbage, but this game is pretty good.			",123,31,2,15,13,0,19

												It's a sad day, the day I have to give an anno game a thumbs down. Having sunk over a hundred of hours into Anno 1404 - Venice I was really looking forward to a fresh start in this game, set in a different time with different, new, obstacles to overcome. Unfortunately I could not find anything that would make me want to play this game more. Nothing that would keep me awake for hours planning trading routes in order to build even greater cities. It is not a bad game, though. The visuals, the sound effects and music are, as for every Anno game, stunning. I really enjoyed the couple hours I spent playing I just didn't feel like playing more of it.			",148,15,1,12,7,0,12

												I'm going to start this review off by saying that I actually do recommend this game quite highly, but only to certain people. If you are a casual gamer, turn around now. This game requires so much strategy, planning, and some luck in map generation that trying to play it as you go can and likely will screw you over later in your game. Pros:--Great fun to customize your city and build your civilization. Seriously, it gets so exciting and I really don't even know why.--Sense of accomplishment when you look at your self-sufficient society at the end of a game.Cons:--Watching your resources to figure out where your production error stems from is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Fixing it can be even more so.--This game does not prepare you for itself in any way, shape, or form. I had to watch about three hours of ""Let's Play"" videos before I was prepared for endgame. If not daunted by this review, look up the Anno 2070 Beginner's Guide by NsN on youtube. Each of the videos is ~an hour, but they're funny so it's not a hard watch.			",101,16,0,34,21,0,33

												This game is quite good, but it is simply dwarfed by all three of it's immediate pre-decessors and even by the first game in the series ANNO 1602 when it comes to fun and playability.  ANNO 2070 somehow took everything that ANNO 1503 (The worst in the series) did wrong and selectively included most of the enjoyment killing mistakes.Anno 1440 with the Venice add-on and ANNO 1701 are certainly the best in the series as far as enjoyment and playability are concered.There is a fine line between too much and too little complexity or micro management.  Too simple and it is boring, too complex and it becomes too laborious.The whole ecologist vs industrialist thing made good valid social statement (and raises climate change awareness), but did absolutely nothing in the way of making the game fun to play.

												Extremely addictive and with beautiful visuals, Anno 2070 is close to GOTY for me. The gameplay is easy to get into but has a profound complexity which slowly unfolds in regular play as your city branches out and your responsibility grows. While single-player free play can entertain you for hours on end as you attempt to foster one or several factions under growing pressure from both the environment and challenger factions, multiplayer can refresh the gameplay and make Anno 2070 feel like a whole new game. The only real drawback for this title is that it's tied to U-Play. Having to download this atrocity and go through it every time you launch the game is an annoyance I can't seem to quell, especially after the hack. [8/10]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have no idea how I missed such a superb building RTS like this one when it came out years ago but I'm glad I've discovered it now! It's indepth, interesting and beautiful to look at. I never get tired of zooming in to see the details of the many vastly different buildings and houses and with the Deep Ocean expansion, the underwater world around your islands are unbelievably gorgeous. As if that's not enough to make it worth buying, the storyline, NPC character personalities and missions add another layer of fun to the game. The 'life' of the world you inhabit and colonize is what sets this game apart. This is a definite MUST HAVE if you love city building games!			",34,16,0,14,21,0,3

The game has a bit of a learning curve to it but once overcome its quite a fun experience sepcially with friends.I recommend this highly, Get some friends and build some empires/hippiecitties!

												After six hours of this game, and almost five hours of playing it, I'm simultaneous intrigued and disgusted.  It's an interesting game, but unless something changes, I may never buy from UbiSoft again.I'll start with the good parts.  Anno 2070 is basically Caesar meets Red Alert, with a clever mix of city-building and war that I've seldom seen elsewhere.  While this is ostensibly a real-time strategy game, the combat seems to take a back seat to the economic development of island settlements.  You'll have to manage raw materials, electricity, pollution levels, population, food and drinks, entertainment, and military.  Fortunately the pace is slow enough that this is actually possible.There are three playable factions, each with different production chains, and specialties.  The Ecos are stereotypical environmentalists with wind farms and tea planations, the Scientists are exactly as you'd expect, eating artificial food and building nuclear power plants, and the Tycoons are your run-of-the-mill capitalists with smoke-belching coal plants and fast food chains.  I haven't played long enough to really contrast them, but so far it seems to work out nicely.So all in all, it looks like a great game.  So why am I not recommending it?The observant among you may have noticed the one-hour discrepancy between how long I've had it and how long I've actually been playing it.  Let me start this explanation with a question:  If you buy a game on Steam and hit the ""Play"" button, shouldn't it just... I don't know.... Play?No, that would be too easy.  Starting Anno for the first time went something like this......Download and install.  Just as easy as with any other title on Steam.  Took a little longer than usual, but no big deal....Hit the play button... Hmm, it wants to optimize my graphics?  Sure, why not.  Save me some time cranking up all the video settings.... The game seems to load up, and throws some graphic on the screen, and then immediately returns to the desktop.  Uh, what?...Now it should launch the game, right?  Or at least a settings utility?  Nah, it has to launch an auto-updater.  Wait a second... Isn't that what Steam does?  Automatic updates?  Why is the game loading its own update utility?  Hmm......A little while later, that finishes... Time to play, right?  Wrong.  Now it needs to set up UPlay.  Apparently Ubisoft is trying to make their own Steam, and it's required for this game.  Ugh... Ok, as long as it doesn't get in the way......UPlay needs to update itself.  Two seconds after it finishes downloading, it has to update.  Did I accidentally buy an MMO?  Is this World of Warcraft?  I thought I just bought a game on Steam, a platform that keeps everything up to date on its own...  Alright, I'll go get a snack while this thing updates itself... Again....It finished updating!  Time to play!  Oh, it wants a CD Key.  Sure, no problem.  Grab it from steam, paste it in.  Done!  Let's play!...Now it wants me to create a UPlay account... That's just for online multiplayer, right?  I don't really need that... Except you can't load the game without it.  Now I'm getting angry, and if I hadn't already paid for the game, I'd have uninstalled it right there....Fine.  Here's a throwaway e-mail account.  I'll use my usual username and a simple password.... Ok, I'll use a longer password... Ok, I'll add numbers.  What the hell am I protecting, a bank account?  This is just a game!  Fine!  Now the password is annoying enough that I have to write it down somewhere....The username is taken?  Fine, here's another one.... That too?  Fine, another... Another... Another.... Just take this stupid incompehensible string of letters.  I'll write that down too... Just let me play the game already!...So, made a UPlay account.  Oh, it's not just an account.  It's an entirely new application that's probably going to destabilize my computer like so many before it.  Well, I can at least put it in offline mode.  After all, I don't plan on doing multiplayer in this game, at least not right away....Now I need to login to it.  So much for offline mode.   It made me turn that back off.  Oh well.... Username... Password... There.  What do you mean that's not a valid username?  It's the one I just created!  Try again... Nope.... Ok, here's a wild guess.  Maybe, when they say username, they really mean e-mail address.  So instead of using that username that took six tries to find one that wasn't already taken, let's just not use it at all.  So why couldn't the e-mail just be the damn username!?...Login with my e-mail and password.... FINALLY, time to play... Enter my CD-key... Didn't I do that already?  Fine, copy and paste... Nope, can't paste... Alt+Tab back and forth, entering a few characters at a time... Fine....It's loading!  It's loading!  It's the actual game!  Woohoo!...Create a character name.  Sure, no problem!  Xentor!...It's taken.  Wait, what?  I thought this was my character name... Why does it have to be unique?  Great, it's another stupid username.  Let's try a couple.  Taken, taken, taken.  To hell with it.  I'll just use the same one I used for the stupid, useless, waste-of-time UPlay account.  Ok, that works.  Now NEVER ASK ME AGAIN....The game is starting!  And the first thing it says?  It welcomes me to the game, addressing me by that stupid unique username.  The game now constantly refers to me as that gibberish username, because OBVIOUSLY anything readable was already taken.So, to my new enemies at UbiSoft... Here's a tip.  If you're going to publish on Steam, let Steam handle the DRM, because you guys obviously have no clue what you're doing.  You just lost a customer.And to those of you reading this review, considering buying the game... I leave that choice to you.  The game itself is good, but UbiSoft has tried very hard to make sure that playing it just isn't worth the effort.Graphics/Sound: 8/10Gameplay: 8/10Overall: 2/10.			",205,90,1,24,32,1,50

												Ah yes, the ANNO series - an arguably underappreciated group of citybuilder and economic strategy games. ANNO has two key features to differentiate itself from SimCity et al.: a far more involved economy and water. Lots of water, in fact. ANNO 2070 in particular is set in a future version of our world (circa 2070 CE, hence the name) where the world's ice sheets melted and made dozens of island-sized landmasses habitable. Your job is to develop a thriving city (or multiple cities) on these islands where all the needs of the population are catered to by your government. Yes, that's right: you are in charge of co-ordinating factories and production lines for everything from fish to robot butlers, hologram projectors, and jewelry. This inevitably leads to a need for trade routes between islands, sprawling production complexes both above and below water, and ways of limiting the resultant ecological damage so that a giant tornado of doom doesn't swoop down and destroy it all.It's probably evident by now, but this game can get very complicated, very quickly.Despite all my enthusiasm, there are a few features that detract from the game (constant internet access is required for DRM and a couple gameplay elements), but they present few problems in actual gameplay. I would highly recommend picking up this under-recognised title both for a mental challenge and the calming effect of just watching a massive empire run like clockwork.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												UPDATE: I have now discovered that there's no way to view detailed information about the economy. This makes it a matter of trial and error to determine how much of what you need to produce. Which I find very frustrating. While I really enjoyed the time I did play the game, I now find myself wishing I'd spent that $30 on beer instead. I have thus updated my review to not recommend the game. It's a brilliant game that's just poorly executed. However, if you're considering it, I do recommend reading the rest of my review. The straw that broke the camel's back for me may not bother you as much.Original review is all of the following.TL;DR: This game is sort of in the gray area between SimCity and Civilization (closer to Banished than SimCity as far as city-builders go, if you've played that). It's a brilliant game, but with very noticeable cons. As gameplay isn't really affected by these issues, I'd describe the experience of playing this game as sort of like seeing a fantastic movie in a crappy theatre with uncomfortable chairs and somebody texting a few rows up. You still really enjoy it, but there are small things that bother you a little bit the whole time.More details: I have many things I like, or even love, about this game. Many things about it are simply brilliant. However, before getting to those, let me first list the caveats without which I would not recommend it. Some of these may be a dealbreaker for you.-Uplay is very, very annoying. I consider Steam like the iTunes of gaming, and it's as though one record label was like ""okay well you can listen to our music through iTunes, but only if you also open up our other music player software and first validate that you did indeed buy the music."" It doesn't prohibit playing, but it's very, very annoying. It's just an extra step that's both unnecessary and inconvenient. And those extra steps add quite a bit of time between purchasing and actually playing, probably a solid 20 minutes.-The interface and keyboard controls are very counterintuitive (x and y to rotate the camera, really?), and there's no tutorial on how to play. I only figured out how to use this game with extensive use of Google on my phone. This is the sort of stuff one might expect or tolerate from an inexperienced indie developer's first game, but from a big name like Ubisoft it just feels like laziness. Either way, it makes the learning curve much steeper than it should be, and led to a few exasperated shouting matches with my desktop.-The cities seem to lack some things that are fundamental in other city builders. For example, there seems to be very little by way of transportation management. However, there are certainly other areas of the gameplay that make up for this, it's still overall a good game. Not necessarily inferior to other city builders, but definitely different from them. Like I mentioned earlier, it's much closer to Banished than SimCity as far as city builders go. Don't expect SimCity (you place every single building, for example, which is like Banished but unlike SimCity).-At $30, I find it a little overpriced. $20 would be a deal, and $25 would be reasonable.However, now let me get to why I do still recommend this game:-The gameplay is *awesome.* I've only done ""continuous"" mode (as opposed to campaign mode), and It's somewhere in the middle ground between SimCity and Civilization. You build your city on your island, but you have to explore the surrounding area to discover neighbors or uninhabited islands, and can engage in diplomacy or trade with them. Each map has so many islands, and you can expand to the uninhabited ones. In fact, you have to do that or trade to be succesful, because no single island would be self-sufficient for an advanced city. The way cities almost ""level"" based on what different classes of people demand and can produce is simply brilliant.-The economy is *very* well done. This is really my favorite part of the game.-The difficulty levels are well done. Easy mode is easy, but not pointless. It's just an easier version of a still very interesting and rewarding strategy game.-The backstory is coherent, intelligent, and complex. Which doesn't necessarily affect gameplay, but is nonetheless something I really appreciate. It's not without its simplifications that may annoy some of the more pedantic players, but definitely a big step above the norm for this sort of thing. The world you build in is still a thoroughly sci-fi/fantasy world, though, it doesn't feel like anything that might actually be around 56 years from now.-There are a lot of small details that are well done. When you zoom in, for example, you can hear what people are saying based on their class and satisfaction level.Several things I have yet to try, so can't remark on:-Combat-Advanced diplomacy-Campaign modeOverall, I definitely think the pros make up for the cons. I wholeheartedly recommend it, as long as you know what to expect.			",6,2,0,5,6,0,8

												Up and down, good and bad. So hard to like, so hard to dislike.Game's got a lovely atmoshpere, beautiful too look at. Though the interface is nice, because of the steep learning curve and the depth of the game with it's many buildings and needs, gets clutered in the end.The BGM is superb, sounds ok and voice-over could have been better, but it's all adequate.It does however have Ubisoft written all over it. They seem to want to take over the world with extra points, achievements and every bit and♥♥♥♥♥♥you can think of, like in HoMM6. I see where they want to go, but it isn't working i'm afraid.Game was worth a few hours, to really try it, but in the end it failed to challenge on many levels and there are lots of other similar games that are better out there.Shame!

												Anno is a very nice experience. The ecological mindset and futuristic but plausible science make this game attractive. The storyline and events going on give you enough to do on a daily basis even up to a democratic system where all the players slightly effect eachothers games. Sadly I can no longer enjoy the game on my new computer since I have the Crash on Load bug and even though I tried everything I haven't managed to convince the game to operate. Still I endorse this game and hope this issue will be resolved sometime by smart people who love keeping good games alive.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It was released in November 2011 and is a great game. I've put 7 hour sessions into this game, and I show no signs of stopping. It is a new, futuristic step in the series, and is a strong one.The basic premise of the game is that the world's sea levels have risen and previous landmasses have become islands, and uninhabitable wastelands have become paradises. It is your mission to repopulate the world from your ark - a kind of sea station.The ocean is a major focus of this game Much of the expansion and all battle and trading is done by sea. This makes a unit's speed, carrying capacity, armour and damage ever more important. The trading mechanism works really well, being able to set up a different route with each unit is easy and intuitive.The game is great. It has an interesting style and great development of cities - better in my opinion than the newer Sim Cities. For example, my capital city on my industrial playthrough was growing and I was doing well, and I expanded onto another island. When I went back to my capital, I realised how dense the smog was around the city. It's details like that that really help build immersion and realism.It's easy to sink hours into a game and not reach the endgame, or even the midgame. If you are a fan of real time strategy games like Age of Empires, then this game is a perfect purchase for you. This award winning mixture of diplomacy, war and construction is sure to win you over to it.			",80,8,0,17,19,2,16

												I have been playing this game on and off for years now, and it's still enjoyable.  I've never had a problem with the game running, nor have I had problems with Uplay or Steam, but it seems a fair amount of people have.  It might be worth looking into before you sink money into the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ah yes, the ANNO series - an arguably underappreciated group of citybuilder and economic strategy games. ANNO has two key features to differentiate itself from SimCity et al.: a far more involved economy and water. Lots of water, in fact. ANNO 2070 in particular is set in a future version of our world (circa 2070 CE, hence the name) where the world's ice sheets melted and made dozens of island-sized landmasses habitable. Your job is to develop a thriving city (or multiple cities) on these islands where all the needs of the population are catered to by your government. Yes, that's right: you are in charge of co-ordinating factories and production lines for everything from fish to robot butlers, hologram projectors, and jewelry. This inevitably leads to a need for trade routes between islands, sprawling production complexes both above and below water, and ways of limiting the resultant ecological damage so that a giant tornado of doom doesn't swoop down and destroy it all.It's probably evident by now, but this game can get very complicated, very quickly.Despite all my enthusiasm, there are a few features that detract from the game (constant internet access is required for DRM and a couple gameplay elements), but they present few problems in actual gameplay. I would highly recommend picking up this under-recognised title both for a mental challenge and the calming effect of just watching a massive empire run like clockwork.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After six hours of this game, and almost five hours of playing it, I'm simultaneous intrigued and disgusted.  It's an interesting game, but unless something changes, I may never buy from UbiSoft again.I'll start with the good parts.  Anno 2070 is basically Caesar meets Red Alert, with a clever mix of city-building and war that I've seldom seen elsewhere.  While this is ostensibly a real-time strategy game, the combat seems to take a back seat to the economic development of island settlements.  You'll have to manage raw materials, electricity, pollution levels, population, food and drinks, entertainment, and military.  Fortunately the pace is slow enough that this is actually possible.There are three playable factions, each with different production chains, and specialties.  The Ecos are stereotypical environmentalists with wind farms and tea planations, the Scientists are exactly as you'd expect, eating artificial food and building nuclear power plants, and the Tycoons are your run-of-the-mill capitalists with smoke-belching coal plants and fast food chains.  I haven't played long enough to really contrast them, but so far it seems to work out nicely.So all in all, it looks like a great game.  So why am I not recommending it?The observant among you may have noticed the one-hour discrepancy between how long I've had it and how long I've actually been playing it.  Let me start this explanation with a question:  If you buy a game on Steam and hit the ""Play"" button, shouldn't it just... I don't know.... Play?No, that would be too easy.  Starting Anno for the first time went something like this......Download and install.  Just as easy as with any other title on Steam.  Took a little longer than usual, but no big deal....Hit the play button... Hmm, it wants to optimize my graphics?  Sure, why not.  Save me some time cranking up all the video settings.... The game seems to load up, and throws some graphic on the screen, and then immediately returns to the desktop.  Uh, what?...Now it should launch the game, right?  Or at least a settings utility?  Nah, it has to launch an auto-updater.  Wait a second... Isn't that what Steam does?  Automatic updates?  Why is the game loading its own update utility?  Hmm......A little while later, that finishes... Time to play, right?  Wrong.  Now it needs to set up UPlay.  Apparently Ubisoft is trying to make their own Steam, and it's required for this game.  Ugh... Ok, as long as it doesn't get in the way......UPlay needs to update itself.  Two seconds after it finishes downloading, it has to update.  Did I accidentally buy an MMO?  Is this World of Warcraft?  I thought I just bought a game on Steam, a platform that keeps everything up to date on its own...  Alright, I'll go get a snack while this thing updates itself... Again....It finished updating!  Time to play!  Oh, it wants a CD Key.  Sure, no problem.  Grab it from steam, paste it in.  Done!  Let's play!...Now it wants me to create a UPlay account... That's just for online multiplayer, right?  I don't really need that... Except you can't load the game without it.  Now I'm getting angry, and if I hadn't already paid for the game, I'd have uninstalled it right there....Fine.  Here's a throwaway e-mail account.  I'll use my usual username and a simple password.... Ok, I'll use a longer password... Ok, I'll add numbers.  What the hell am I protecting, a bank account?  This is just a game!  Fine!  Now the password is annoying enough that I have to write it down somewhere....The username is taken?  Fine, here's another one.... That too?  Fine, another... Another... Another.... Just take this stupid incompehensible string of letters.  I'll write that down too... Just let me play the game already!...So, made a UPlay account.  Oh, it's not just an account.  It's an entirely new application that's probably going to destabilize my computer like so many before it.  Well, I can at least put it in offline mode.  After all, I don't plan on doing multiplayer in this game, at least not right away....Now I need to login to it.  So much for offline mode.   It made me turn that back off.  Oh well.... Username... Password... There.  What do you mean that's not a valid username?  It's the one I just created!  Try again... Nope.... Ok, here's a wild guess.  Maybe, when they say username, they really mean e-mail address.  So instead of using that username that took six tries to find one that wasn't already taken, let's just not use it at all.  So why couldn't the e-mail just be the damn username!?...Login with my e-mail and password.... FINALLY, time to play... Enter my CD-key... Didn't I do that already?  Fine, copy and paste... Nope, can't paste... Alt+Tab back and forth, entering a few characters at a time... Fine....It's loading!  It's loading!  It's the actual game!  Woohoo!...Create a character name.  Sure, no problem!  Xentor!...It's taken.  Wait, what?  I thought this was my character name... Why does it have to be unique?  Great, it's another stupid username.  Let's try a couple.  Taken, taken, taken.  To hell with it.  I'll just use the same one I used for the stupid, useless, waste-of-time UPlay account.  Ok, that works.  Now NEVER ASK ME AGAIN....The game is starting!  And the first thing it says?  It welcomes me to the game, addressing me by that stupid unique username.  The game now constantly refers to me as that gibberish username, because OBVIOUSLY anything readable was already taken.So, to my new enemies at UbiSoft... Here's a tip.  If you're going to publish on Steam, let Steam handle the DRM, because you guys obviously have no clue what you're doing.  You just lost a customer.And to those of you reading this review, considering buying the game... I leave that choice to you.  The game itself is good, but UbiSoft has tried very hard to make sure that playing it just isn't worth the effort.Graphics/Sound: 8/10Gameplay: 8/10Overall: 2/10.			",205,90,1,24,32,1,50

												Up and down, good and bad. So hard to like, so hard to dislike.Game's got a lovely atmoshpere, beautiful too look at. Though the interface is nice, because of the steep learning curve and the depth of the game with it's many buildings and needs, gets clutered in the end.The BGM is superb, sounds ok and voice-over could have been better, but it's all adequate.It does however have Ubisoft written all over it. They seem to want to take over the world with extra points, achievements and every bit and♥♥♥♥♥♥you can think of, like in HoMM6. I see where they want to go, but it isn't working i'm afraid.Game was worth a few hours, to really try it, but in the end it failed to challenge on many levels and there are lots of other similar games that are better out there.Shame!

												UPDATE: I have now discovered that there's no way to view detailed information about the economy. This makes it a matter of trial and error to determine how much of what you need to produce. Which I find very frustrating. While I really enjoyed the time I did play the game, I now find myself wishing I'd spent that $30 on beer instead. I have thus updated my review to not recommend the game. It's a brilliant game that's just poorly executed. However, if you're considering it, I do recommend reading the rest of my review. The straw that broke the camel's back for me may not bother you as much.Original review is all of the following.TL;DR: This game is sort of in the gray area between SimCity and Civilization (closer to Banished than SimCity as far as city-builders go, if you've played that). It's a brilliant game, but with very noticeable cons. As gameplay isn't really affected by these issues, I'd describe the experience of playing this game as sort of like seeing a fantastic movie in a crappy theatre with uncomfortable chairs and somebody texting a few rows up. You still really enjoy it, but there are small things that bother you a little bit the whole time.More details: I have many things I like, or even love, about this game. Many things about it are simply brilliant. However, before getting to those, let me first list the caveats without which I would not recommend it. Some of these may be a dealbreaker for you.-Uplay is very, very annoying. I consider Steam like the iTunes of gaming, and it's as though one record label was like ""okay well you can listen to our music through iTunes, but only if you also open up our other music player software and first validate that you did indeed buy the music."" It doesn't prohibit playing, but it's very, very annoying. It's just an extra step that's both unnecessary and inconvenient. And those extra steps add quite a bit of time between purchasing and actually playing, probably a solid 20 minutes.-The interface and keyboard controls are very counterintuitive (x and y to rotate the camera, really?), and there's no tutorial on how to play. I only figured out how to use this game with extensive use of Google on my phone. This is the sort of stuff one might expect or tolerate from an inexperienced indie developer's first game, but from a big name like Ubisoft it just feels like laziness. Either way, it makes the learning curve much steeper than it should be, and led to a few exasperated shouting matches with my desktop.-The cities seem to lack some things that are fundamental in other city builders. For example, there seems to be very little by way of transportation management. However, there are certainly other areas of the gameplay that make up for this, it's still overall a good game. Not necessarily inferior to other city builders, but definitely different from them. Like I mentioned earlier, it's much closer to Banished than SimCity as far as city builders go. Don't expect SimCity (you place every single building, for example, which is like Banished but unlike SimCity).-At $30, I find it a little overpriced. $20 would be a deal, and $25 would be reasonable.However, now let me get to why I do still recommend this game:-The gameplay is *awesome.* I've only done ""continuous"" mode (as opposed to campaign mode), and It's somewhere in the middle ground between SimCity and Civilization. You build your city on your island, but you have to explore the surrounding area to discover neighbors or uninhabited islands, and can engage in diplomacy or trade with them. Each map has so many islands, and you can expand to the uninhabited ones. In fact, you have to do that or trade to be succesful, because no single island would be self-sufficient for an advanced city. The way cities almost ""level"" based on what different classes of people demand and can produce is simply brilliant.-The economy is *very* well done. This is really my favorite part of the game.-The difficulty levels are well done. Easy mode is easy, but not pointless. It's just an easier version of a still very interesting and rewarding strategy game.-The backstory is coherent, intelligent, and complex. Which doesn't necessarily affect gameplay, but is nonetheless something I really appreciate. It's not without its simplifications that may annoy some of the more pedantic players, but definitely a big step above the norm for this sort of thing. The world you build in is still a thoroughly sci-fi/fantasy world, though, it doesn't feel like anything that might actually be around 56 years from now.-There are a lot of small details that are well done. When you zoom in, for example, you can hear what people are saying based on their class and satisfaction level.Several things I have yet to try, so can't remark on:-Combat-Advanced diplomacy-Campaign modeOverall, I definitely think the pros make up for the cons. I wholeheartedly recommend it, as long as you know what to expect.			",6,2,0,5,6,0,8

												Anno is a very nice experience. The ecological mindset and futuristic but plausible science make this game attractive. The storyline and events going on give you enough to do on a daily basis even up to a democratic system where all the players slightly effect eachothers games. Sadly I can no longer enjoy the game on my new computer since I have the Crash on Load bug and even though I tried everything I haven't managed to convince the game to operate. Still I endorse this game and hope this issue will be resolved sometime by smart people who love keeping good games alive.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a review of Anno 2070, nothing more and nothing less. I point this out because it pains me to see this have mixed reviews when most of the reviews of the game itself are in fact, positive. I get it, people do not like the DRM or Ubisoft and want to slam them, but this is not the place for that because I have had no problems with the DRM, and Ubisoft is no different than a lot of big publishers in their practices.Now, with that out of the way let us get down to what we're all here for. Is this game any good? Yes, without a doubt I fully recommend this game to anyone that is a fan of both economy style games, and city builders. The game looks fantastic, runs smoothly, and can be as hard or as easy as you want it to be. With the addition of an internet connection, more features open up as well as multiplayer options which can make for some awesome games.The premise of the game is that the world is flooded, and there is little land left to live on. As a result, you are tasked with building a new future with the aid of your Ark, which is basically a mobile sea base that is also a submarine. You'll find yourself tasked with building up housing, industry, trade, and in some cases raising a military. Additionally, you'll find 3 factions striving to get your attention, each with their own bonuses and drawbacks. Unlike some games, you can work with all 3, and to some extent a minimal level of cooperation is required. Last but certainly not least, you'll also need to manage the eco balance, because it will affect you in positive and negative ways.It is pretty simple to dive into the game, and as you progress you will find that your people demand higher quality goods, which require more complex trade routes and industries. For example, at first your people are cool with just fish, but eventually your people will be asking for things like cheeseburgers, or even lobster dinners!For a greater challenge, you'll find other players (Human or AI) that will also be trying to build their colonies up as well. With limited resources, this will eventually lead to trading partnerships, or outright war. The 3 factions vying for your attention will also be offering missions with various bonus resources or modules to improve your units or buildings.If you are connected to the internet, if you're getting bored with your current map, or you've obliterated the competition, you can take resources from the current map in limited quantities, and have a boost to the next map! Also, you can participate in global politics that will result in actual bonuses that other players have voted on.Overall, I highly recommend this game. Even if I put it down for a few weeks to play something else, I keep coming back, and that is a sign of a good game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't recommend it purely due to Uplay. I installed Uplay but every time I try to launch the game it crashes instantly and never actually lets me play. It seems to be a Uplay error, but if the company can prove me wrong, I'd be happy to accept a fix.Meanwhile, it's pretty frustrating to purchase a game and not have it work at all.

												This is a strange experience.. I write a review and havent played the game yet.. not one second.My journey starts with the usual download.. then patches, then UbiSoft Patches, more UbiSoft updates, asks for a UbiSoft Account Login.. ok, why do I need that on Steam? I try to create account. Tells me servers not alive to create account. Try 10 times, always same result. I kinda get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off.. top right click.. UbiSoft.. the name rings a bell far in the back of my head... what the heck.. restart Anno 2070 Launcher right away! More UbiSoft updates.. but didnt it just before.. why do I have UbiSoft ringing in my ears? Ok, different login screen.. different looking registration screen.. it took me a bit till I found a working Username.. UPL4YUSUX worked after many tries.. first you try your standards.. and as you have to click create, then confirm that you accept their AGBs.. to find out the name is taken.. WHY the hell is this name UbiSoft stuck in my head... you get past that.. you have to choose your Profile name.. You enter how YOU want to be called.. aehhhh name taken.. Name taken? What the heck did I enter before... how many accounts, logins, profiles, game keys (3 times you have to enter that one) does this game wants from me... and then it smacked me like a sledgehammer right in my balls! U B I S O F T ... the company which gives you leprosy just thinking about em.. I took the keyboard and had to write a warning right away.. they game might be great, I have no clue as I wasnt in the mood the invent another name, user, login, profile, holy♥♥♥♥♥♥I installed a UbiSoft game on my machine.. I hope I still can have babies... devastated right now, guys!Will contact Steam to have the option to take UbiSoft games out of my store display.. jesus, that was so close.. and Doc told me.. my testies are fine!

												The Anno series has always been an interesting resource management/city builder with a little bit of combat on the side. This is a great addition to that, set in the future where water levels have risen and the world is a series of islands. While I do thoroughly enjoy this game, my only gripe is that it is impossible to get in touch with the developer unless you speak german, and there are some tiny bugs in the Deep Sea DLC that I don't expect to get addressed as they almost never update the game.

												Great game, but as everyone else says, uPlay is garbage.  I played this game for many hours over a year ago, and I just built a new PC and wanted something to play.  All the new games are too expensive at the moment, so I thought I'd go back to Anno since the new release is coming soon I felt the nostalgia.  Boy, I had forgotten just what garbage Ubisoft is.  The fact that this game is getting mixed reviews is solely based on the horrible experience provided by their lousy uPlay system.  If they are going to release a game through steam, they had better be darned sure that it works.That all said, the game itself is great.  If you can get through installing it - and then consequently repairing it and googling around for answers on how to actually make it run, then it's a nice reward.  Just be prepared for a lot of frustration.  You need to be someone who can hunt down problems and fix them, or else you won't even get to start the game.So, I'm not actually recommending it since the newer game is coming.  I don't think there is any kind of important back story that you would want to play through before getting the newer game, so it's best to leave this one be.  Hopefully the install and configuration will be worked out in the new game and people can get back to reviewing the actual game and not the terrible company that is producing it.			",33,2,0,13,2,0,3

Switching to a lower resolution doesn't help either because then the mouse position is way off, the clicks don't occur where the cursor is.Result: Unless I buy a magnifying glass to read the tiny text, I'll not be able to play the game.

And after the searching the internet I see their solution is don't play if it dosen't work.Thouroughly disapointed10/10 would have Uplay take a♥♥♥♥♥♥on its customers again.NOTE: The game itself is very good and if it works you will have great fun however this cant be recomended beacause of the mess that is Uplay.EDIT: This can be avoided. I have now discovered if you download the game through steam and then the uplay launcher from the ubisoft site, (and then install the game through uplay again using a steam key) the game works and plays fine			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Don't buy this game if you have a high screen resolution! I've been trying to play this game on a UHD 4K screen (3840x2160), but the font size is tiny and there is no way to scale the UI up. Switching to a lower resolution doesn't help either because then the mouse position is way off, the clicks don't occur where the cursor is.Result: Unless I buy a magnifying glass to read the tiny text, I'll not be able to play the game.

												The game itself is a great city-builder style strategy a-la tropico. It also has some interesting online features such as bonuses voted on by all of the games players. I loved playing it for as long as I did. But alas, I cant play it anymore, due to Uplay, Ubisoft's unreliable broken DRM, that crashes whenever I try to use the game. If you can get uplay to work and like the genre, then by all means, buy it. But until Uplay either works or is removed, I cant reccomend this game to anyone.			",104,18,0,24,37,0,64

												The game is really really fun. I absolutely love it. But... you guessed it... Uplay. I'm one of the lucky few that's actually able to play the game. Still, I encounter ""your account doesn't have this game"" error, every one of third time I launch the game. It's total chance that I'm still able to play tbh. Even EA does a better job when it comes to their Steam clone. Any game that involves Uplay is a must avoid.Besides that, even though I love the enhanced gameplay aspects, the 1404 aspects fitted the Anno concept better. If you're a newcomer to the series, I recommend Dawn of Discovery / Anno 1404 (US/EU name difference, same game). If you played Anno before, you'll also love this one. (If you decide to take up the gamble, and beat the odds of ""serial is invalid"")			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												a complex but easy to grasp resource system, lots of excellent usability features and concepts all around and a very very nice UI / HUD (for a transportation / resource management game, i find their UI is often very poorly done), BEAUTIFL graphics...I love playing this game competetively against friends and AI, but I also find I love playing in a very easy game mode where I can basically just build aesthetically pleasing settlements. The underwater mechanic is also extremely well done and very interesting.My only gripe is that the two ""sides"" are pretty contrived and extremist...you're either insanely anti-environment or pro-environment, it would be nice to have some intermediate or other teams to play, but honestly it's not much of a complaint, it fits the overall theme of the game really well.the two teams also play completely differently, which is very refreshing - most games would take the easy way out and just make a carbon copy for a new team and only change the visual aspects, but they are literally different in almost every way, from the resources you collect, to how your tech trees expand, down to your individual units.i recommend this to ANYONE who likes any kind of resource management, transportation, combat-lite, etc. fantastic game, worth every penny.

												I give this game a ZERO.  Its yet another UPLAY failure.  It doesn't matter if the gameplay is good.  Because you will never be able to play the godless thing.  Ubisoft has moved to a DRM model called UPLAY.  and god help you if you have windows 8, Teamveiwer, a virusscanner, or any of about 37 other peices of common softwear installed.  This is the third time I've accadentaly bought a game from Ubi Soft, and every time I spent about an hour trying to make it work.  But every time I have to go to extra legal source jsut to play the game I paid for.  So to recap DO NOT buy this game, and  DO NOT buy Ubisoft.  The DRM is a nightmare.			",60,16,0,6,14,0,6

												SOMEONE BUY THIS SO WE CAN PLAY CO-OP PLS. :DCity building, researching, ocean exploring... I haven't played a combination like this since Outpost 2 in the 90s. If you like elements of the Civilization series mixed with RTS and pretty city placement, grab this. Lot's of fun, tons of unlockables, open-ended maps, and replay value. You can play as 2 factions (Ecos or Tycoons) with harmonize-with and♥♥♥♥♥♥pillage the eco-system playstyles. For instance, the Ecos use wind turbines that don't produce much power, but have no negative eco-impact. The Tycoons, on the other hand, burn coal in churning factories supplied by strip-mining.This is a VERY PRETTY GAME. Check my screenshots, it even has a postcard mode for capping. The economy is centered around leveling up your citizens. Certain ranks of citizen require certain needs to be fulfilled before they'll upgrade to the next class, granting you more buildings to build, and higher tax revenue.  For instance, starter Tycoon employees just need fish and alchohol to get by. If you build a Casino nearby, however, their need for entertainment is fulfilled, and they'll upgrade their housing.There is a myriad of raw materials to process, which factors in to the whole ecosystem thing. The game is set in a post-global-warming Earth, so most maps are small islands in a large ocean, and different islands have different crops they can provide, and minerals to mine. This is where competition with AI or human players comes in: You can diplomatically trade for rights to settle, or the goods you need, or you can build a war fleet and attack.Combat is fun, and rewarding, as it takes quite an economy to back a successful navy, and you can upgrade your ships with parts you research.I've only really scratched the surface, and there's more to say about the game, but I hope I've provided enough flavor to interest you.The only real downside to Anno 2070 is the secondary UPlay softward you have to install to play it. It's spotty, unnecessary, and has kept me from playing the game more than once because the servers were down, though they have added an Offline mode that works.BOTTOM LINE: FUN CITY BUILDER. BUY, PLAY CO-OP WITH ME. DRM IS STUPID.			",449,93,4,65,65,4,79

												I can understand the negative meaning about Uplay. It would be very fine without that.But anyhow, I do not endorse to talk down a game because of a copy protection / user login method.It is a very nice and interesting game, that I recommend - the Anno series (originally from Sunflowers) is unique in it's way! And although I was in fact sceptical about an Anno, playing not in the past, it is really fun playing - even after about 2 years and about 200 hours * - the publishers have made it to keep the feeling and atmosphere of the earlier sequels.The improvements in goods chains, diversity and also graphics and sounds - not to forget the ark, where you can store goods or items from game to game, career points/daily tasks - do not go without notice ... from 1602 to 1701 to 1404 and now to 2070.Even positive to tell is, that not like 1701, also beginners can switch to an easy enough difficulty mode.So my conclusion: If you tend to grumble about a few seconds waiting on Uplay ... do not buy.  If you can wait on a login (and you know that Ubi is not the only company, who want to save their software against piracy) and you want to play and support a very good, interesting and somehow challenging ... then buy and have fun.I am - for my person - hope that it will not be the last sequel (even it could be hard to better the game itself). That is for sure the reason, I do not like those reviews, telling only about Uplay!!PS: * My gaming hours are only the ones from the Steam version			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First bad review, here we go.The game looks like it could be fun, and I'm going to give it a proper chance.  The campaign mode is annoying to me, and I don't like the way they stitched the story together.  If you are looking for something sim-city-ish, this does not seem to be the way to go.  I am hesitant to bash the game itself too much as I haven't played it much yet.  BUT, as others have wrote, UPLAY is garbage. It only installed off there website, and after patching, setting up another account, keys, and generally struggling with it, it did work.  But it seems to want to run while the game is playing.  It bothers me that I had to spend this time setting it up to play a game I just bought, and as well that I have to download and run additional software.  After giving this game a proper run, I'm going to remove all of it and avoid their software in the future.  Boo UBISOFT, Boo..			",59,22,1,6,20,0,23

												It's so nice that Ubisoft decided to make their own game client. I love opening up Steam, going to play Anno 2070, and then opening uPlay, logging in, and having uPlay launch Anno 2070.I have to say though that what I truly love is getting into Anno 2070, having it ask for my CD key, having to select cancel because it says someone already has used that CD key (me) and then having it prompt me to login to uPlay (in game). The real joy though comes from being unable to play the game because when I try to login it tells me my password is wrong, even though I just logged into uPlay to launch the game. So, in short, I'm never buying anything from Ubisoft again.			",69,12,1,12,8,0,5

												I can understand the negative meaning about Uplay. It would be very fine without that.But anyhow, I do not endorse to talk down a game because of a copy protection / user login method.It is a very nice and interesting game, that I recommend - the Anno series (originally from Sunflowers) is unique in it's way! And although I was in fact sceptical about an Anno, playing not in the past, it is really fun playing - even after about 2 years and about 200 hours * - the publishers have made it to keep the feeling and atmosphere of the earlier sequels.The improvements in goods chains, diversity and also graphics and sounds - not to forget the ark, where you can store goods or items from game to game, career points/daily tasks - do not go without notice ... from 1602 to 1701 to 1404 and now to 2070.Even positive to tell is, that not like 1701, also beginners can switch to an easy enough difficulty mode.So my conclusion: If you tend to grumble about a few seconds waiting on Uplay ... do not buy.  If you can wait on a login (and you know that Ubi is not the only company, who want to save their software against piracy) and you want to play and support a very good, interesting and somehow challenging ... then buy and have fun.I am - for my person - hope that it will not be the last sequel (even it could be hard to better the game itself). That is for sure the reason, I do not like those reviews, telling only about Uplay!!PS: * My gaming hours are only the ones from the Steam version			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I decided to rewrite this review one more time to decrease the high rate of fangirling that it had.This game is an RTS and a city builder at the same time, but the RTS features are much stronger and apparent than the city builder ones, however, what makes it different from regular RTS games is that it relies on economic dominance instead of using gun power, armed units are only there to protect trading routes and keep pirates and enemies away.The game's challenging because you have to colonize a number of islands and build underwater settlements to stay ahead of opponents and enemies who will be doing the same.It has a multiplayer feature but it's poorly optimized and hardly populated to consider it a working feature.It gets new missions added every once in a while and has career points that will unlock better technologies in the game, as for the DLCs, I recommend getting Deep Ocean only because it's the only one that actually adds a good enough content to the game instead of just throwing some lousy cosmetics at your face.The game is beautiful and runs smoothly even on low spec systems.At last, the game is really immersive and fun with 2 main factions to choose from and if you managed to get over the fact that it requires Uplay to work then you'll actually enjoy it.

												Needs UPlay, which needs a UPlay account. I was asked to enter the Verification Key THREE Times. Needs a different, unused (online) ""Nickname"" before launch, even if you do not want to play online.After I found an unused Nickname, it needed to ""Reboot"". Again: after it forced me to enter a Nickname it needed to REBOOT. Freshly installed via Steam, it needs another 15 Minutes of ""Autopatcher"" updates.I do not even care anymore how good or bad the actual game is. I will just never buy a UBISOFT game ever again.7 Month later (11 Octoer 2015):I just tried to play Anno 2070 again...Fresh Wndows install, only installed (in order): firefox, drivers, steam, annoUplay dies with""uplay launcher funktioniert nicht mehr""(uplay launcher does not work anymore)Next try in 6 Months i guess...

												I've never played any of the other Anno games, and although I've only spent a little time in this game so far, I'm convince it's excellent. I've only really encountered the city building experience so far, aside from some minor combat during missions. I definitely think this game is worth checking in to. PROS:- Looks great.- Very deep. Lots of things to keep you busy forever, really.- Keeps you busy. We all know how tedious city building games can get at times.- Lots of stuff to unlock.- Satisfying. When everything balances out well, it just feels good.CONS:- Uplay. (I haven't had issues with it, I just dislike the service. Opposed to DRM.)- Steep-ish learning curve.This review really doesn't do the game justice, as I'm still only scratching the surface. I'd recommend checking out some videos on Youtube, and deciding for yourself.			",81,45,0,8,21,2,26

												The storytelling of the campaign is bad. Many events happen with no explanation at all. For example, during the first mission, our allies ship try carrying oil out of the area. An enemy ship appears, and suddenly starts attacking. While I thought, ""Oh, this must be those Ecos, so they are some sort of terrorist group."" there was no explanation on who, or why was attacking. In a similiar fashion, all the cutscenes were designed very bad. I didn't try any of the multiplayer play however, that might be better.While Steam shows 2 hours on record, I did play it offline for around 5-6 hours.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Like seriously, 0.99$ for a mouse cursor? shouldn't those be installed? 0.99$ for a splash screen, I thought this kind of things would be included with the main game. The fact that the main game without DLC looks a bit like qbert is painful. This game ruined it for me. If any game is offering 250 dlc packages like this one is, i won't buy it.

												A very pretty game with the promise of a well balanced, relaxing strategy experience. But then you have to use Uplay. If you are still ignorant of the evil that is Uplay consider yourself blessed and move on. As far as the actual game goes, It's a very pretty, mildly entertaining Strategy/City builder game.Unfortunately the game is far more complex than it initially appears, and does either a poor job of explaining itself, or not at all. I had to constantly refer to various Wikis and forums just to figure out what the heck the game wanted from me. And while I expected it to carry an evironmental protection message, I wasn't expecting it to beat me over the head with it constantly. Even the gameplay reflects this, to the point that the tycoon faction can barely do anything without summoning a storm of acid rain, or a giant oil spill. Personnally it felt as though the only viable choice for long term success was to choose the green  Eden faction, which may reflect the real world, but when the game sacrifices balanced gameplay for preaching it made me loose interest very quickly			",51,8,0,22,16,2,18

												The thing that really ruined it for me was having the right resources on the right island. Sure you can set up complex trade routes, sure you can buy a bit off the AI but it's never enough. There are simply too many different resources being needed on different islands and when you never have what you need it's extremely frustrating and basically it ruins the game. It would be a lot better if there was simply a way you could have your own ships automatically go round stocking each island that has a resource level below the minimum amount you specify. Anno is focused so heavily on multiple islands working together yet the game lacks anything that makes your life as easy as it should be. Anno 1404 was alright but this is just unplayably boring. Unless you enjoy spending all your time restocking islands and waiting for them to get restocked, don't waste your money even if it's on sale, you'll just feel ripped off.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've heard wonderful things about this game. Too bad Uplay makes it impossible to play. Since I bought it in summer 2014 I haven't been able to play a single minute of it. It's incredibly frustrating. I do not recommend buying this game.			",54,17,1,11,17,0,6

Support is god-awful and slow. I have the ♥♥♥♥ing keys, I have the game installed, just let me play the ♥♥♥♥ing product I bought. Pirate this game, seriously. ♥♥♥♥ you Ubisoft.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum, fifteen men in a dead man's accusation of piracy against an environmentally conscious consumer.Batten down the hatches as Irreverend Opinions dives into Anno 2070.---The BlurbAnno 2070 is an environmentally-themed conquest strategy game. The world has been flooded thanks to climate change, with sea levels and temperature changes making it a much different Earth to what we're used to. Between the primarily naval battles, the game also runs a coherent online society to make it seem like you're having to cope with a new age of humanity.The GoodThe game is quite good once you can play it. There's a simple enough tech tree, and a somewhat believable system of diplomacy and trade.Combat is interesting, as is base building, with major crops dictated by regional fertilities, and having an impact on the game.The graphics are pleasant and thought out, with units and buildings looking the part one would expect from the various groups and organisations of the future.Multiplayer, and metagame-multiplayer, are both done very well, with a fairly interesting social media style play choices along with a balanced matchmaking engine.Despite the issues with installing, the tech support were very accomodating once they accepted the problem was legitimate, and it felt like they did a lot to fix the issues, especially the ones they were used to.An 'ongoing' campaign means you can keep building up your personal base without restrictions.The BadThe voices of characters can be really repetitive after a while, since the types of conversation they have don't really cycle all that much.  They speak a lot, so it becomes necessary after a while to actually turn the voices off if you don't really feel like putting up with it.The game engine has some optimization and performance issues - on a high-powered gaming system, sometimes  slowdowns will occur with nothing else running.The benefits of advancing through the different factions are mostly cosmetic - and not that amazing, at that.The UPlay interface takes a very long time to load, and the installation can be glitchy as all hell.The UglyThis is the unfortunate part.Popup notices for ""Anno Online"" blight the UI on occasion, though Ubisoft seems to have learned not to do this lately.  This isn't a facebook game, please don't thrust your latest fad in my face.  In fact, thrusting anything in my face is a bad career choice.The game was nightmarish to first install, with Ubisoft customer support not recognising the ""Complete"" package on offer here on Steam, resulting in UPlay not showing the DLC purchased.Customer support then seemed more inclined to ignore the Steam page proferred as explanation in order to accuse me of piracy.  Not the seafaring kind with flags and drunken antics and bawdy shanties.  The kind with download restrictions and court cases.Needless to say, that did not go over well.  Especially since it took a lot of work to actually get them to pass me to tech support so that the installation could be completed.Repeated messages about their player and payment record security being compromised and my needing to change my password and/or credit card details did nothing for peace of mind.SuggestionsDear Ubisoft.  If your account security is poor, improve it, or limit what you can host on the server.Please also update your customer service staff on what products are being sold.  Being accused of a crime you have not committed is a criminal offense here in Australia, and it lends literally negative weight to the support you give for ""corporations can be responsible with their infringement enforcement"" arguments.If you have honestly stopped with the popups, then thank you for your adapting to the modern player's mindset of not wanting to get advertisements in a paid-for product.  If you've only stopped because you've run out of things to sell, I should like to point out that if you do this again, I will make a point of not buying that product until it's available through a Humble bundle, or a 90% off Steam sale.Please fix up the default voice acting so that there's less repetition.And to repeat: never, never accuse a paying customer of piracy.  They will remember that long after you've fixed the mistake.The Summary8/10.  Besieged by technical woes and even worse executive decisions, but supported on being a fun game and having good customer support.

												Gameplay bugs, an unintuitive interface and complete lack of a good tutorial make this game unplayable for me. My play stopped on mission 3 when attempting to collect a water sample. The item was collected, went to take it to the ark to find I couldn't complete the quest,I'd like to say this future set post apocalyptic RTS was fun up to this point but I'd be lying. Linear quests and an unclear objective structure meant that the game felt more like completing chores than creating an active, thriving future economy. My hopes were dashed after my expectations were set so high. Beautiful graphics and a good concept backing the game up, I could hardly see how they could have got it wrong - but they have and badly.From tussling with multiple screens in the Uplay DRM (waiting about 30 minutes to play the game after download is a joke) to actually trying to achieve anything in the game without scrolling through in-game menus and consulting Google, Anno 2070 is not fun in the slightest. When the real challenge and time spent in a game is trying to figure out the ambiguous objective points it’s setting you, there's little fun to be had.			",306,136,6,62,48,1,45

												Anno 2070 is a must-have for someone that loves complexity. Easy to learn, hard to master game's mechanics. Managing production chains of food, drinks, and lifestyles needs, with their own trade route. Virtually-generated population that eat tons of food, sipping gallons of tea, throw away their smartphones within minutes, that will rise against you if you ignore them. Well, it's just like the Anno I know.			",261,75,14,40,32,0,33

												Note: I own ANNO 1701 & ANNO 1404As far as the ANNO series goes ANNO 2070 is the most ""featured"" of the games.  I enjoy it as a game but I wouldn't recommend it.  The reason being the following;1)  The graphics aren't as good as ANNO 1404.  Most of the game is dark or cool toned with only 1 climate.  Both ANNO 1701 & ANNO 1404 feature bright vibrant colors and the maps have nice water effects that change color as you traverse the world in your boat.  Northern isles have a very dark green water color, southern isles have a very nice tropical look and effect.  ANNO 2070 does not.2) It's super duper preachy.  The game is a hot jumbled mess of trying to teach you how important the environment is.  Or that mankind is destroying the environment.  It's no coincidence that the best and the most necessary energy production plants are ""green tech"".  Even if you pick Tycoon (which is a captialist/pro big business faction) you still need to build things like a Hydroelectric dam because you just cant sustain islands with Nuclear power (unless you have the proper research to reduce meltdowns).  Which is funny because apparently in the future all nuclear power plants seem to melt down.  3) Compared to ANNO 1404 it feels like a reskinning of 1404 with a future setting.  The Tech faction can easily be compared to the Orient Class.  What does ANNO 2070 do right?Multiplayer and nukes.  If you can try to play 1701 or 1404 give those a try before you decide to buy any of the ANNO games.  In my opinion 1701 is the crown jewel of the series.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So, I played this game for about 19 hours. I played for a while and then I got away from the game due to school, work, etc. I try to get back on the game and then uplay crashes on me over and over and over and yet it claims that my computer is playing another ubisoft game so the video game fails to launch. I dispise this function because it shouldn't matter how many games that i have running you shouldn't cancel the function of a game due to another game running. What is worse is the simple fact that steam was the only program that i had running, I didn't even have a web browser open. The game is wonderful but the whole uplay thing is total garbage.

It's so indepth, and right now it's on sale for $7.49 or $12.49 for the complete addition which adds 3 DLC. This game is incredibly deep and will leave you playing for a very very long time. With those prices versus how depthy this game is, you have no reason not to buy it, same with Skyrim. I'm not a huge PC player but this is a game worth downloading.			",51,3,1,2,5,0,3

												The game is good. Probably the best in the ANNO series. However, it is close to unplayable because of uplay. The installation takes about fifteen minutes, and when that is done, you'll have to spend an hour tinkering with settings and browsing forums to get it to launch. This, ubisoft, is utterly ridiculous, and you should never have released such a buggy piece of s*** to your customers.			",63,24,2,6,33,2,34

												Frequently unplayable due to DRM is all I have to say.I was a huge fan of the original series but I think Ubisoft's intrusive DRM ruins this version. That's sad because the game is rather fun when you can get it to run. It maintains the basic production chain balancing across multiple islands idea that the original series did but with better graphics and a cool scifi setting. I just wish it would consistently install and start.			",227,55,4,25,42,2,61

												I have to echo everyone else's sentiment on the U-Play launcher.  Total piece of garbage.  The reason I gave the game a thumbs up is because the actual game itself (once you get into it) is fun and addicting.   Great way to burn a couple hours away without realizing it. The issue I had with the U-Play launcher is this:  after downloading and installing through Steam, I hade to manually go into the Anno game folder, manually launch the U-Play launcher, register for an account, associate my game with said account.  Without doing this, it would NOT open the game.  The U-Play launcher would just open to the white splash screen and do absolutely nothing.Get rid of the U-Play launcher, Ubisoft!  I understand the concept behind it, but the execution was just terrible.			",17,5,0,6,1,0,3

												When I first got the game, I didn't think that it will be alot. I was expecting some mere farm-house-storehouse-palace network of economy and protecting your land from the invaders, etc.However, I was ever so greatly pleased to soon realise that the economy tree in the game is rich and you can spend hours and hours just enjoying watching how things develop. Politics in the game are also quite good, you get reputation for achieving quests from different factions, which usually involve you in further development.The idea of Ecos and Tycoons (two possible factions) is very pleasing to me personally too. Techs (third faction) are providing lots of benefits to building your economical titan of a city. And with the Deep Ocean DLC life becomes even more interesting,The fighting in the game is not as pretty though, alas, and it's probably for the best if the player is not depending on that entirely.I give 8.9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

If I could revert the updates back to 2012-12-28 I would give this game a sideways thumb, but I can't even that. Uplay is needed on top of steam, read other comments. I agree, don't buy this or the new game (2205), you will probably regret it.

												This is mostly to help counter balance all the reviews giving it a negative score simply because of uplay, that's not how you review a game and certainly not something that should give it a negative score. This is a fantastic game in the Anno series, simple beginnings and as you develop more and more it grows to be more complex, you have the usual rivalries with other persons and grow your economy, manage trade-routes, and (hopefully) get the resources most favorable to your ever continueing expansion. As you grow you gain more ways to develop, science is of course an important part of this later on as well as deep-sea (which is part of it) which is a nice addition to the game. Choose which faction you start with and whom you align with, vote in the Senate with other players to see what effects you'll get, have (occasional) special events pop up which give you story and unique rewards for completing the challenges they bring. You also have the ARK (if I remember the name right) which is your personal HQ of sorts, it can carry over some of the things you developed for future worlds you play in as well as some resources, in this way it can help you feel that what you did previously mattered, that what you made still exists and this new zone you are going to is yet another of your many expansions. Truly my only complaints with this game are that the AI I don't consider quite as good as in Anno 1404, the development of their island is in a way that wouldn't make sense economically and wouldn't work normally really with some of the AI players, which is unfortunate. I'd have much preferred if they had the same limitations as the player and just did well that way, and that they would be a tad more aggressive with claiming islands. Other than that, there is of course personal preference. Some people don't like the time period, which is fair. But objectively this is a very nice game in the series and I would heartily recommend for people to get it if they don't mind these shortcomings, it adds quite a bit to the series and it has a lot of replayability.

The maps are kind of small and world domination is a little too easy, but overall a fun game.That being said, I can only recommend that anyone interested in playing Anno 2070 figure out how to pirate it instead.  As long as UPlay exists, Ubisoft deserves to have their property stolen.  Heed my warning.  I read other people's negative review's of UPlay and figured it couldn't possibly be THAT bad.

It is at a point where now I actually don't buy ubi soft title because of uplay...Outside of that the game is good, well realized and has depth that are quite enjoyable, but the game itself is let down by the system			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Anno 2070 delivers a concept very similar to many real time strategies I have encountered, and I would say it stands between a future iteration of Age of Empires, and Civilisation. The game's premise lies on diplomacy and civilisation construction in the near future, and has landgrab elements behind it.First off, first impressions of the game are dire. After installing it from Steam, you are forced through a convoluted system of using Ubisoft's own launcher to run it. Don't have a Ubisoft account? You're forced to make one, and install all their periphery software. After installing the game, it took me around half an hour to begin playing it, due to all the ""required"" set up protocols from Ubisoft.The learning curve to play the game I found very steep, regardless of the fact I have played games in a similar genre. All the information for the game is written up in an interface, but I'm the sort of gamer who wants to jump into a game and start playing. Had their tutorial levels been more developed, I wouldn't have had to access this information. Another utility they provide to help is an AI character, which doesn't seem to perform much, apart from sounding fairly artificial (If you pardon the pun). I had the impression that the game's development could be a lot better.In terms of the missions, they make sense, and are enjoyable to play, after getting past the hurdle of learning the ropes. The visuals are appealing, but not fantastic, still, effort has gone into that area. Their character progression system is rewarding, but I am dissapointed they have not provided Steam Achievements, only their Ubisoft equivalents.So all in all, I would give this game a 67%.Would I buy it? I already own age of empires and civilisation. There's nothing groundbreaking about this game.			",94,9,2,29,12,0,17

												Anno 2070 is so addicting, by that i mean i sat down and played for 3 hours straight. Not many games have that affect on me, especially an RTS like this. The gameplay is tremendously slow but uses this as an advantage by inputting multitasking to make your experience in Anno 2070 fly by. Sadly this game requires Uplay which is terrible. The problems i have faced with Uplay is only creating an account which took frustratingly forever, If you're going to be a first time user of using Uplay, i reccommend being patient because finally you will be able to finally play an awesome game: Anno 2070.9/10 ",47,3,0,8,7,0,8

												This is one of the rare games I've completed. The gameplay is similar to other ANNOs, with the difference, that youhave the Ecos and the Tycoons to play, of which I prefer the Ecos. The multiplayer has also some good inventions.- EXCELLENT Graphics- Good Mission Design (Map design is random but also good)- No Secrets I found- PvE is not always balanced, because the AI can build things, you can't build. PvP is perfectly balanced, since every Player has the same starting options.- Good Story- not cheap, but I think its worth its price- Good Multiplayer (problematically, if you don't have much time (multiplayer time boost))- All Bugs I discovered got patchedDL-Contents (DLCs):- some extra missions- some extra units ( only usable if all players in the game have the dlc)- some extra technologies (always usable) ",255,38,10,35,35,1,58

												I recommend this game to people like me who enjoy strategic games, but don't feel the need to play a competitive match for fulfillment.  However, unlike almost pure sandbox games with small goals thrown in (like Rollercoaster Tycoon or the unique Cities in Motion), the challenge of Anno 2070 and its predecesors comes from the environment itself, making it a stimulating challenge.  The incredible length of a single game will put most people off, but it has great replayability in the sense that you'll still be discovering/optimizing/inventing after your hundredth hour of gameplay.  For those familiar with the earlier games in the series, it is a genius translation to modern times.			",192,102,1,41,31,3,56

Less about churning out tanks and trying to research orbital lasers as fast as possible, and more about developing a strong economic environment, well maintained and well protected from external threats. The closest analogy would be; the style of play of Sim City and Age of Empires, and the setting of Brink. All in all, a rewarding play experience, well worth the price.			",93,8,0,11,4,0,9

You can fight other people, but the main part of the game is about planning your cities and resources, couse without population or resources you wont get very far. Its suprisingly relaxing exept if everything is going down the drain. This is a slow paced game, you dont just rush through it.If you like planning your citybuilding and resource chains...... your going to love this one!. If you however like fastpaced games with require little planning or thought.... avoid this game at all cost!.I happen to like planning so im one of the people who loves it. And i would recommend it strongly to anyone who is like me.Edit: Also playing this game with the steam controller works nicely.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Anno 2070 is easily the prettiest town building, resource gathering strategy,. that Ive ever played.  At first I thought it was a bit odd compared to the others out there, but it quickly became my favorite.  Thats my opinion of the game,Here's my obligatory Uplay rantA lot of people review this game unfairly because of the Uplay overlay and DRM.   I think its wrong because, even though purchases will have to deal with it, and it should be mentioned, and perhaps affect the score some, the score really should be about the game and its content.  That's what we are meant to rate.  Dramatically bashing the game because of some umbrella DRM like Uplay has a greater affect on the people who worked hard to make the game than it ever will on the corporate giant that published it.That being said, Uplay really isnt so bad, Except wihen things like a forgotten password or some bizarre file management hiccup ruins your whole gaming experience.  for some being forced to do business with the commonly unliked publisher is enough cause to boycott the product.  Though the only one I can think of is that I was able to use Uplay points to buy free content in Assassins Creed IV.  But I doubt they are going to change their business model because of complaints from users-- as sad as that sounds, they likely aren't listening, or just have no control over their own investments.  The biggest problem I have with the Overlay, is that it causes clutter and confusion in my software libraries and accounts.  Steam is nice, because it centralizes and organizes things, its stupid to have two overlays with their own complicated API between them, both verifying, listing, and managing my game content.  And I wouldn't appreciate having a separate account and separate library for just my ubisoft games.  It was a poorly planned move on their part to try and establish this kind of seclusive community, when people want what Steam already provides, which is more freedom and inter connectivity.  They had no room to grow outside of their own library.			",54,20,1,15,3,0,8

												Anno 2070 is a very good strategy game/economy simulator. You set up goods-chains, and use them to evolve your city (soon to be cities). For those of you who have played ANNO 1404, this game is very similar. It mainly takes away ground combat, and introduces undersea exploration/exploitation/combat, ecobalance, aircraft, electricity, and (if you got the DLC Deep Ocean) economic takeovers of Islands.You start the game by picking one of the two available races: Eco, or Tycoon. These symbolize the stereotypical environmentalists versus the Industrialists. Eco are more inefficient (they use up more space for their agriculture and industries, and have a harder time generating large amounts of power) but are more friendly on the environment (an actual mechanic in the game). Tycoon are very efficient, using up little space, but playing carelessly can damage the ecosystem of your island rapidly inviting disasters like acid rain. There is also a third faction, Tech, which you unlock after playing for a while (you can't start a game with them). These give you access to more advanced parts of the game, such as airplanes and the underwater part of the game.The game takes place on islands, and you initially start with a ship with just enough resources to found a settlement on one of them. Here you will (usually) start out growing your population, and to do so you must satisfy their rising amount of needs. To do so you have to set up production chains to deal with this. To start out, for example, you will have to satisfy their demand for food, and soon drink. Both factions needs access to fish, and it's the simplest goods in the game only requiring fisheries. Drink is the first production chain, and it requires putting down a farm to produce rice, and then using this rice to produce tea or liquor (depending on if Eco or Tycoon).The population is divided into different ""tiers"" that you will gain access to as you grow your population and satisfy their demands. You start out with simple workers, who when satisfied will advance to employees, and so on. Housing a certain amount of population belonging to a certain tier will give you access to new buildings, and that is how you progress in the game. As your islands start housing more advanced inhabitants, their needs will grow as well, forcing you to colonize additional islands for their natural resources. An employee, for example, usually require a good that requires resources not found on your main island. By colonizing another island you can get access to these resources, and set up internal trade routes that will automatically ship these goods around where they need to be. Setting up and protecting these routes is crucial to progress beyond the beginning of the game. The game also has conflict. When there are more players on the map (or AI-players that inhabit islands) this comes into play. If you want an island someone else is already on, you can just settle it at the same time (although this will probably♥♥♥♥♥♥them off), but usually you will want to kick whoever is on the island of it to have access to all the real estate on it. Without the DLC Deep Ocean (highly recommended) this is only doable through military means, and this is probably the weakest part of the game. Unlike Anno 1404 there is no land combat (besides using airplanes). Combat is mainly based around naval combat, and to remove someones presence from an island, you need to take out their warehouse (which serves as the islands main access point) and depots (buildings that distribute and gather resources). The main reason this part of the game isn't very strong is due to the lack of ground-based troops, and low ship-diversity in the beginning stages of the game. This means you have no actual way of permanently dealing with other islands in the early stages of the game, which can result in a frustrating experience for both the winner and the loser (since all you can do is cripple them to the point where it just becomes a waiting game until you lock airplanes). If a game progresses beyond the third tier of population without a clear winner, though, more units start opening up for a much more interesting gameplay.With the Deep Ocean DLC you can buy shares on an Island. If you control the majority of shares, you can spend a great deal of money to forcefully buy the Island from whoever owns it. This mechanic is called Hostile Takeover, and it makes it possible to play an aggressive game without using military might. However, you will still need a military presence to protect your trade routes from potential aggressors. Like mentioned earlier there is also an underwater part of the game. You can find underwater plateaus and settle them once you unlock the Tech population, which gives you access to submarines. Here you will find, and are able to cultivate, resources unique to the seabed. There are plenty other mechanics and gameplay elements as well, but this should give you a basic introduction to the game. Feel free to leave a comment if you have any questions!

												A great addition to the series, If not the best! Looks beautiful, concept is pretty simple for the most part but once you get your Tech rolling the game really starts to open up possibilities. The Community aspect of the game is neat i thought. With Voting for leaders who add diferent bonuses, to Global Events were all players complete certain missions adding points to a worldwide pool which once milestones are reached will allow you to unlock in-game goodies. Then there's normal multiplayer games. If your a fan of logistics or just city building in general then give Anno a shot.			",57,2,3,12,15,0,10

												The game was okay, looks good aesthetically and has a neat GUI, gameplay used to be immersive but one of it's best aspects: 'world events' is gone, it's been turned off.

The official forums are gone, good luck wih any technical support, Ubishaft reached their projected profits and doesn't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about this game and especially its players anymore.Attrocious DRM, ie.

												Let me tell you a story.(Just go to the bottom for the review if reading is too hard)T'was the fourth Friday of the month and with money in my account I decided to do some game shopping. I myself use Steam as a medium for purchasing such items as I am not a lumpy faced reptilian cretin and after finding Anno 2070 I thought to myself ""Wow this game looks like an experience I could spend some of my hours away from the tedium of everyday labouring to enjoy"". But oh how wrong I was. After purchasing the game for what is, to me, the equivalent of 2 hours of mind numbing work I discovered that it required U-Play in order to launch. Slightly peeved, I decided to install the 3rd party software to get my money's worth.I soon came to the shocking realisation, however, that U-Play would not open when I commanded the game to launch. Irked to no end I decided that I was adept enough at the use of computers to attempt to combat the issue head on (by reinstalling U-Play and opening it before I tried launching the game). After doing so it seemed that I would finally get the chance to start reeling in those U-Play points (or whatever the ♥♥♥♥ U-Play are giving users to make them feel like they are using Steam instead of this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥. But instead the problem had merely evolved - evolved into an issue which is not only beyond my own personal computing skills to fix, but apparently beyond the internet. So to conclude this tale of hardship and pain I leave you with this - heed my warning: if you buy this game (as good as it may actually be) you will be left with a literally unplayable game, £20 out of pocket and most detestable of all; a U-Play account.

												The game was okay, looks good aesthetically and has a neat GUI, gameplay used to be immersive but one of it's best aspects: 'world events' is gone, it's been turned off. That's because Ubishaft no longer bothers supporting this game properly. The official forums are gone, good luck wih any technical support, Ubishaft reached their projected profits and doesn't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about this game and especially its players anymore.Attrocious DRM, ie.

												This game's first level consists of a series of installation screens. To be honest it's pretty dull. By the third bar you know what's coming... 100% of course (big shock).Level two throws the player into a white knuckle thrill ride in which a uPlay account must be created and then used to login. The password part is a bit too simple if you ask me (spoiler: you're restricted to alphanumeric characters ... dur!).It's a bold move to make the whole thing crash before giving the player a sample of any of the cities or actual strategic gameplay, and it does feel like false advertising, but I think overall it was worth the price. At least I can expect some Ubisoft and Ubisoft Partner ""deals"" in my email soon.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is possibly the best City building game there is. First off, the world pretty much went to the gutter, and it's your job to fix it (If you work for the Eden Initiative) or to adapt to it (If you work for Global Trust). On top of the usual challenges of building and supplying your settlements, there is Fire Risk, Crime and Health Problems to solve, you can end up going to war with the other leaders of your sector, and finally: the struggle with eco balance, which affects and is affected by your production of goods and exploitation of the planet; positive eco balance gives your farms high yields (and your population is generally happier), while negative eco balance lowers your agrarian yields and can even result in the elusive Tornado Disaster. It is entirelly up to you who to work for and how to build your settlements, when and how to go to war, and who to trade your resources with... Cherry on top? the multiplayer and the community are over the top. Every now and then a new ""world event"" starts, where everyone in the world pitch in their efforts for a common goal. You can play multiplayer as co-op (two or more players, playing the same faction) or as ""rivals"" (two or more players competeing for the best islands and resources, although not necesarily at war).All things sumarized, I highly recomend this game.

												Pros: The game is absolutely beautiful. It will eat your time. If you're into the open world/economy/civilisation/ aspect of city building strategy, this is it. The military aspect can be better, but I view it as a plus really. Definitely not for people who like blowing things up. This was my first game from the Anno Series, and truth be told I've logged more hours than it says up there (IYKWIM ;)). I waited two years for a good sale before buying this game on steam, ultimately it was worth the wait. For me.Cons: One word. DRM. Ubisoft hates gamers. To launch this game, you will also need to install UPLay. Ubisoft's poor sad version of Steam. And to use the ark feature, you have to be online at all times. Its a joke really. And the 3 activation limit thing. You get three licenses so to speak, meaning you can't install it as many times as you normally would and could with other games. And that is just plain wrong. I suggest you read the forums and find out more about these cons before you buy the game. Its worth a look, if only to make a more informed purchase. To be honest, this isnt new with Ubisoft. They've been screwing with PC Gamers for years. This game however, is probably at the top of the DRM complaints for them.My recommendation: Only if youre a massive fan of the genre. There are less frustrating games out there, without all the hassles of dealing with Ubisoft. If it wasn't for steam and the fact that I love this genre to bits, Ubisoft would get nothing out of me.

												While there may be much room for improvement in the game (in terms of replayability and content), its quite intense in multiplayer and can provide huge amounts of hours of fun. My favorite is Domination mode, where you have to outplay opponents in scenarios without having to be online in the same time as your opponents. This is where I spent the majority of my game-time, as it is a level playing field and a great way to get friends to team up against others and put together a strategy to win (as its not just the scenarios itself you have to play well, but also the Domination Map that connects the scenarios.

												Anno 2070 is like it's predecessors, a game where you have to build cities on many different islands. It has the same features that makes this game unique. The difference about this game from is predecessors is that there are now air units and more ships in this game, making trade easier, yet harder at the same time.

The maps are kind of small and world domination is a little too easy, but overall a fun game.That being said, I can only recommend that anyone interested in playing Anno 2070 figure out how to pirate it instead.  As long as UPlay exists, Ubisoft deserves to have their property stolen.  Heed my warning.  I read other people's negative review's of UPlay and figured it couldn't possibly be THAT bad.

												Allegedly this is a great game, but since the demise of GFWL, Uplay has been the latest tool to stop you from playing the games you buy. Uplay crashes every time the game is launched, but the priated version works fine.Avoid this game like the plague until that DRM garbage is removed.Edit: I was able to play the game on a friend's computer. Seems like a pretty fun game.  I wish I could play it on my computer.			",261,73,4,38,53,1,75

												So yeah. Anno 2070 is one of those ""Oh no that's way to complicated for me!"" games. But after playing it for some time i've found out 2 things... It's VERY time consuming and being the leader of a international trade organization is really stressfull, countless times I didn't have enough space to throw down my tea fields or distilleries. But that's basically what this game is all about: Managing everything efficiently.Tons of fun.Time consuming.Rewardingly difficult.7.5/10 ",113,6,0,8,8,2,6

												A solid sequel in the Anno series, unfortunately marred by Ubisoft's horrendous uPlay DRM and an obtrusive amount of cosmetic and functional DLC. Anno 2070, while set in a futuristic dystopia and populated by factions divided by their approach to techology and resource preservation, is functionally identical to its predecessors. This is a good thing, as those mechanics are both fun and unique in the strategy genre. In the Anno games you start out with a small settlement which you need to expand by building residences. As the population increases, they will begin to demand certain goods which you can provide by building production structures. It is these production structures which drive the Anno series. Resources are not just produced from a single entity. Instead resources will need to move through a supply chain until they finally produce a finished good at the last stage. As your population advances and new demands emerge, you'll find your supply chains stretched thin as demand pulls raw resources and processed resources along multiple paths.While a sandbox mode is available, In the campaign and several missions you'll face the additional challenge of enemy factions, requiring you to accomodate defensive and offensive production into your already complicated supply chains. If the idea of a futuristic dystopia marred by ecological disaster and populated by idelogically driven factions is appealing to you, and you can stomach Ubisoft's intrusive DRM layer, then you'll enjoy Anno 2070. If those hurdles are a bit too much, then I recommend playing Anno 1404 instead.			",195,51,0,98,56,0,84

Creating another account which you have to log into to play. To re-iterate, you have to be logged into Steam and UBisoft to play; having Steam and UBIsoft clients running. Also, UBisoft is actively gathering information about you check the EULA; if you opt-out you can't play the game and Steam doesn't offer refunds.

												Wow, I was waiting for a game like this! It's always keeping me on my toes. Although it has a slight learning curve, once you get started you aren't turning back! Your number one priority is to keep your citizens happy. As you start with the bare bones houses, working your way up to the skyscrapers you're going to have to prepare. The starter houses only need a basic food item and drink item (it all depends on who you are). As you reach higher ranks, you have to have telecommunicators, different varieties of food, a news network, voting, and etc..  You'll have to seek out islands to get some of these items. Which brings in the other variable, factions. You will have to make friends, and to do this you will have to give them money,  and do quests for them so you won't get on their bad side. I have to micromanage and look at every one of my allies' arks (basically your main base) to see if they have any of the resources I require to grow my population! You also have the option of settling underwater, which is awesome! But if you do, one of the factions who settle under water will lose respect for you. So it's basically this: Should I go out, plunder the world, but get on everyone's bad side? Or should I be reasonable, stick to my island and make friends doing so? This is one of THE best games I've ever played, and I hope for more in the near future.Edit: I've noticed the review was split down the middle. If it was for your problems with Uplay, then my apologies. This game is well worth the pirate, but it just happened to work for me the first time.			",108,5,2,10,10,0,8

												I'm so disappointed. I did a lot of looking into this game (I thought) before I bought it and now I just wish I had spent my money on something else more entertaining...cheese maybe.Really though, the uplay client it forced me to install was annoying. The gameplay was very dull (and I usually love this type of game), and there is virtually no help anywhere when a problem arises with installation or loading...and problems arose...a lot. I feel like the devs of this game are just sitting back counting money and laughing at all of us for buying into this. Personally, I always take negative reviews with a grain of salt, and don't like leaving them at all. I wish I had listened to the ones I read this time.			",152,149,4,16,31,3,24

												It's a great game a lot of careful planning required on harder levels and rewards attention to detailPVP is basic, neither side can win until late game and then all it takes is one bomber with metamaterial (a tech that makes it invisible for 10 minutes) to make the enemy infastructure crumble by bombing their city centre.The expanding AI are more annoying than a threat, taking islands early on that you might want but don't have enough tools and such to expand there.Hector (a marauding pirate) and sokow (an oil tycoon) like to war each other if on the same map and hector will often sink the oil tankers sokow makes, which causes a black tide if your island is nearby.This is very annoying, it can easily cripple your economy if you aren't prepared so never have sokow and hector on the same map.But as war is optional, I still recommend the game			",214,14,4,16,31,0,32

												Let's just get this out of the way first; UPlay is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ There's no getting around that. ANNO 2070 is worth putting up with it, though. There aren't many games quite like it; it's a cross between a standard RTS, SimCity, and The Settlers. It has elements of all of them, and it blends them very well. There are complicated logistics chains like SimCity and The Settlers, but there's also directly controllable units and combat like an RTS. Unlike an RTS, the pace is quite slow. Challenge in ANNO 2070 is more about setting up logistics chains in less than ideal scenarios. Combat is rare, and usually only involves a dozen units or less.This really is a game geared more towards thoughtful play and planning, there's not as much emphasis on multitasking or quick reactions; indeed it can be quite difficult to retool your logistics chain on the fly. If that sounds like your style of strategy game, then I think you'll quite like ANNO 2070.			",115,14,3,12,19,0,27

												If you're new to this series, you will need to find a youtube video explaining how to actually play it. That said, this is one of the best and most rewarding games in the series. You unlock rewards as you play, there's a peaceful Endless mode to develop your Utopian/Dystopian supercity, and the improvements to the controls and shortcut keys are much appreciated. Plus it has underwater cities.			",243,94,2,47,32,1,64

												I really wanted to like this game. Wasn't really interested in multiplayer so just did the campaign. Which me and my son found aggravating. Most of the time it wasn't that hard to figure out what to do, but then we'd hit a brick wall where neither of us understood what was required to trigger a goal completion and would have to look it up online (which, for me, is not how games should be figured out).

												Let me tell you a story.(Just go to the bottom for the review if reading is too hard)T'was the fourth Friday of the month and with money in my account I decided to do some game shopping. I myself use Steam as a medium for purchasing such items as I am not a lumpy faced reptilian cretin and after finding Anno 2070 I thought to myself ""Wow this game looks like an experience I could spend some of my hours away from the tedium of everyday labouring to enjoy"". But oh how wrong I was. After purchasing the game for what is, to me, the equivalent of 2 hours of mind numbing work I discovered that it required U-Play in order to launch. Slightly peeved, I decided to install the 3rd party software to get my money's worth.I soon came to the shocking realisation, however, that U-Play would not open when I commanded the game to launch. Irked to no end I decided that I was adept enough at the use of computers to attempt to combat the issue head on (by reinstalling U-Play and opening it before I tried launching the game). After doing so it seemed that I would finally get the chance to start reeling in those U-Play points (or whatever the ♥♥♥♥ U-Play are giving users to make them feel like they are using Steam instead of this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥. But instead the problem had merely evolved - evolved into an issue which is not only beyond my own personal computing skills to fix, but apparently beyond the internet. So to conclude this tale of hardship and pain I leave you with this - heed my warning: if you buy this game (as good as it may actually be) you will be left with a literally unplayable game, £20 out of pocket and most detestable of all; a U-Play account.

												This game is so dynamic and wonderful! Uplay is the devil incarnate but the gameplay is fantastic. All of the elements mold into a wonderful economy based strategy game. It may seem boring at first but it speeds up so quickly and makes for a very, very addictive game.

												I can't tell you how many times I've sat down to play this game, only to get stalled for 15 minutes setting up a Ubisoft account and having trouble logging in, which never seems to remember my password even though I have the ""Remember Me"" box checked. And the game has to go through the ""graphics optimization"" routine every single time I sit down to play. By the time I actually get into the game I'm worn out and have lost interest.It's a shame, seems like a pretty cool game, but this Ubisoft account crap is ruining the experience for me.

												Lots of reviews here talk about the Uplay DRM/platform thing. I've never had issues with it but I've heard plenty from those who have. If you can get this game on a sale or something, that's probably the best way. I can't give it an unqualified recommendation, mostly due to the Uplay issues that people complain about so much.That said, this game is a tremendous amount of fun. I'd never played an Anno game before so it had a rather steep learning curve for me. If you play through the campaign, it basically teaches you the mechanics of the game. This is good if you've never played an Anno game before. Once you get the hang of it, it's not so bad. Basically, this is a game of supply chains. Starting with natural resources, you harvest/mine, then make goods, then use some of those goods to make more goods, and so on. Where you have shortfalls or need to move things around, you build ships and transport routes. All the while, you need to keep your people happy or they'll start leaving. You also need to watch your income, as it's easy to get stuck in a downward spiral of diminishing income from which you can't escape.You can also build underwater, which works more or less like building on the surface, just with different graphics and resources.Overall, it's a lot of fun, and once you get a good supply chain going you can either sit back and relax, waiting for enough money to roll in to build whatever decorations and improvements you want, or continue ruthlessly expanding to extract ever more income from your citizens and strip the Earth of its precious resources.This game is a good introduction to the Anno series if you haven't played it before, as long as you're willing to put in a couple hours to really learn it.

												It's a great game a lot of careful planning required on harder levels and rewards attention to detailPVP is basic, neither side can win until late game and then all it takes is one bomber with metamaterial (a tech that makes it invisible for 10 minutes) to make the enemy infastructure crumble by bombing their city centre.The expanding AI are more annoying than a threat, taking islands early on that you might want but don't have enough tools and such to expand there.Hector (a marauding pirate) and sokow (an oil tycoon) like to war each other if on the same map and hector will often sink the oil tankers sokow makes, which causes a black tide if your island is nearby.This is very annoying, it can easily cripple your economy if you aren't prepared so never have sokow and hector on the same map.But as war is optional, I still recommend the game			",214,14,4,16,31,0,32

												Let's just get this out of the way first; UPlay is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ There's no getting around that. ANNO 2070 is worth putting up with it, though. There aren't many games quite like it; it's a cross between a standard RTS, SimCity, and The Settlers. It has elements of all of them, and it blends them very well. There are complicated logistics chains like SimCity and The Settlers, but there's also directly controllable units and combat like an RTS. Unlike an RTS, the pace is quite slow. Challenge in ANNO 2070 is more about setting up logistics chains in less than ideal scenarios. Combat is rare, and usually only involves a dozen units or less.This really is a game geared more towards thoughtful play and planning, there's not as much emphasis on multitasking or quick reactions; indeed it can be quite difficult to retool your logistics chain on the fly. If that sounds like your style of strategy game, then I think you'll quite like ANNO 2070.			",115,14,3,12,19,0,27

												If you like stratagy games but your not really into mass warfare this is the game for you. Even if you are into warfare you can do a bit of that too. Take over and island a populate it with one of two unique groups with there own people, buildings and resource requirements. Its fun, tactical but time consuming.

												The building is just the surface of this game. The establishment of trade routes to sustain island social requirements to advance in technology is practially the main deal with this game. Throw in some optional piracy and otherwise rivals in one session, and you got a pretty interesting experiance that may end up with nukes launching from submarines. It is just multipayer can be somewhat, dead. Just because game lenghs in one session can last for hours and many competivive stuggles may just well end in the late game of total annihilation by units that usually are avalible +2 hours in game progress if someone were unhindered. At least it is better than the next ""Sim City"" or ""Cities In Motion"" disasters of current generation city building games.			",113,5,0,14,9,0,37

												育碧司马，买个游戏1秒钟，然后前后被PlayU（Uplay）换着姿势玩弄了9+小时。看我的时间记录，没错，你没有看错，9+小时，全部在和PlayU作斗争，好不容易连上Update Adapter，老子一看，两眼都是泪，更新要尼玛的1000+小时，而且还不稳定。这反人类的平台啥时候能被取消，简直操蛋。谁买谁知道，育碧司马。Warning：Don’t  buy this♥♥♥♥♥♥ it’s a waste of money and time, no doubt. When I was watching the trailer, it was like “Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ that’s what I am dreaming about.” Buuuuut, after finishing payment I realized very soon that I did not buy a game named ANNO 2070 for $9.99, actually, all I got was a creepy monster named PlayU(UPlay). During the following hours(almost 10), I tried my best to become a PlayU(UPlay) slayer, terminator or something like that, but as you can see, I failed. So, don’t touch anything presented by UbiSoft. No one would judge you as a coward just because you cant be a heroic PlayU(UPlay) slayer. People say that the PlayU(UPlay) is a demon, a monster, a ghost, and is most dangerous in game industry. We are just ordinary people, we can beat it, how pathetic!   UbiSoft, why don’t you just develop a game named “Tricky Tricky, Would you be the PlayU(Uplay) Slayer, I doubt”.♥♥♥♥ off.

												First and most important thing: This game requires Steam AND Uplay to run. Yes, you heard right, a DRM platform on top of another DRM platform. If that is not enough to stop you from buying it, there's more.Installation.Be prepared to waste another 30 minutes of your life uninstalling and reinstalling Anno2070 if Uplay for some reason stops recognizing your legit game.Online features.The game features several gimmick features (such as Ark upgrades that influence economy) that are online-only. The will greatly help you, but there is a caveat. What is it? Well, unlike Steam, Uplay is a buggy piece of crap and the servers are down quite often. Don't get me wrong - the game itself is great, but only when you can actually run it. So, when the server goes down and you are in your single-player game, suddenly your upgrades stop working and you find your economy in the toilet. It might be funny once or twice, but as it happens more often you will find yourself more frustrated with the game than having fun.Anno2070 itself is a great game with amazing visuals and smooth gameplay. It suffers from completely unnecessary online-only features that actually badly impact the experience of legitimate customers.Verdict: 5/10 FAIL			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game art is abso0lutely amazing. It is what most drew me to this game. While the story seems fairly well developed, I didn't feel it was well suited for the style and overall game design very much. The strategy/city building elements felt prematurely mixed with RPG elements, and the UI boundaries between story items and resources in the inventory overlay was both awkward/confusing and a pretty major turnoff overall. I couldn't keep playing this for very long despite having such a big boner for the art style. Also didn't like having to install UPlay. Don't like having a game launcher launch another game launcher before it even launches the damn game.			",334,129,6,50,59,2,80

												The sci-fi ambience is a big part of Anno 2070's allure, and it goes a long way toward making the game feel fresh and surprising. Like being in a utopic Hollywood sci-fi film. An even bigger part of the allure is that Anno 2070 is what you make of it. If you want to chill out with some breezy city building without undue pressure, the easy difficulty setting is an inviting option. Once you get a number of ark upgrades, the hardest setting keeps your mental gears whirring and your clicking finger busy. No matter what your speed, Anno 2070 is addictive in the best way, by combining three brands of compelling design into one: intricate urban planning, time-sensitive questing, and persistent rewards for continued play. And that trifecta will keep you coming back for more.			",1,0,0,0,2,0,8

												Never going to buy another game from ubisoft... I bought this fairly unremarkable game in 2012. Played it for a bit then uninstalled it. Tried to play again today, because I figured, what the hell, I never actually finished it. But, it wont accept my activation key when re-activating the game. I know the account details linked to the key are correct, because I can log into uplay, and see the game in my list of ubisoft games. However when I login to the game, it asks for the activation key, which I enter, only to be told that this key is already in use by another user. Never again!			",9,3,0,5,14,0,16

												The game art is abso0lutely amazing. It is what most drew me to this game. While the story seems fairly well developed, I didn't feel it was well suited for the style and overall game design very much. The strategy/city building elements felt prematurely mixed with RPG elements, and the UI boundaries between story items and resources in the inventory overlay was both awkward/confusing and a pretty major turnoff overall. I couldn't keep playing this for very long despite having such a big boner for the art style. Also didn't like having to install UPlay. Don't like having a game launcher launch another game launcher before it even launches the damn game.			",334,129,6,50,59,2,80

												An example of a game with potential gutted by inexplicably bad design choices. Some nifty ideas; voting community for stuff that affects everyone, etc. Only, you only get 1 profile. No 'starting over'. No playing through with a different concept. You get 3 installations. Significant hardware changes, reinstallations, that sort of stuff? 3 times, then you have to buy a new copy of the game. My wife played it for 4 hours. We both enjoyed 1404, thought we'd like 2070. However, I can't have my own game, my own playthrough. Ever. Not without buying a second copy of the game and creating a completely different UPLAY account. I'm totally serious, it's that absurd. Gameplay isn't bad but not a significant improvement from 1404. Graphics are pretty but minimal city build customization, or any customization at all. It's pretty rote, pretty repetitive. Most of the RTS sort of content feels like an afterthought. I wish I had positive things to say but just trying to get it installed and into a scenario involves the equivelent of the developer sticking a raised middle finger in your face and shouting ""LOL! THANKS FOR THE MONEY SUCKER! LOL!' 20 or 30 times. Having spend several hundred on ubisoft games over the years, this left such a sour taste I uninstalled it, as well as the ACIV I had and prevented me from buying any DLC for this or Black Flag. Decided to look at other game developers who are less utterly contemptuous of people who want to give them money.			",79,9,0,13,17,0,13

												I'm so disappointed. I did a lot of looking into this game (I thought) before I bought it and now I just wish I had spent my money on something else more entertaining...cheese maybe.Really though, the uplay client it forced me to install was annoying. The gameplay was very dull (and I usually love this type of game), and there is virtually no help anywhere when a problem arises with installation or loading...and problems arose...a lot. I feel like the devs of this game are just sitting back counting money and laughing at all of us for buying into this. Personally, I always take negative reviews with a grain of salt, and don't like leaving them at all. I wish I had listened to the ones I read this time.			",152,149,4,16,31,3,24

												It's a great game a lot of careful planning required on harder levels and rewards attention to detailPVP is basic, neither side can win until late game and then all it takes is one bomber with metamaterial (a tech that makes it invisible for 10 minutes) to make the enemy infastructure crumble by bombing their city centre.The expanding AI are more annoying than a threat, taking islands early on that you might want but don't have enough tools and such to expand there.Hector (a marauding pirate) and sokow (an oil tycoon) like to war each other if on the same map and hector will often sink the oil tankers sokow makes, which causes a black tide if your island is nearby.This is very annoying, it can easily cripple your economy if you aren't prepared so never have sokow and hector on the same map.But as war is optional, I still recommend the game			",214,14,4,16,31,0,32

												Let's just get this out of the way first; UPlay is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ There's no getting around that. ANNO 2070 is worth putting up with it, though. There aren't many games quite like it; it's a cross between a standard RTS, SimCity, and The Settlers. It has elements of all of them, and it blends them very well. There are complicated logistics chains like SimCity and The Settlers, but there's also directly controllable units and combat like an RTS. Unlike an RTS, the pace is quite slow. Challenge in ANNO 2070 is more about setting up logistics chains in less than ideal scenarios. Combat is rare, and usually only involves a dozen units or less.This really is a game geared more towards thoughtful play and planning, there's not as much emphasis on multitasking or quick reactions; indeed it can be quite difficult to retool your logistics chain on the fly. If that sounds like your style of strategy game, then I think you'll quite like ANNO 2070.			",115,14,3,12,19,0,27

												Wow, I was waiting for a game like this! It's always keeping me on my toes. Although it has a slight learning curve, once you get started you aren't turning back! Your number one priority is to keep your citizens happy. As you start with the bare bones houses, working your way up to the skyscrapers you're going to have to prepare. The starter houses only need a basic food item and drink item (it all depends on who you are). As you reach higher ranks, you have to have telecommunicators, different varieties of food, a news network, voting, and etc..  You'll have to seek out islands to get some of these items. Which brings in the other variable, factions. You will have to make friends, and to do this you will have to give them money,  and do quests for them so you won't get on their bad side. I have to micromanage and look at every one of my allies' arks (basically your main base) to see if they have any of the resources I require to grow my population! You also have the option of settling underwater, which is awesome! But if you do, one of the factions who settle under water will lose respect for you. So it's basically this: Should I go out, plunder the world, but get on everyone's bad side? Or should I be reasonable, stick to my island and make friends doing so? This is one of THE best games I've ever played, and I hope for more in the near future.Edit: I've noticed the review was split down the middle. If it was for your problems with Uplay, then my apologies. This game is well worth the pirate, but it just happened to work for me the first time.			",108,5,2,10,10,0,8

												The game may be amazing, and once upon a time a demo I played of it I enjoyed.  But I've owned this game since the 2014 Summer Sale.  I still haven't been able to play it.  Uplay lite packed with Steam couldn't get the game to launch, so I had to install the full version of Uplay (strike one).  Even though Uplay, I couldn't actually get the game to start.  Citing missing files because of purchased DLC (strike two).  Additionally I had to both download an old version of the updater from mediafire, and poke around until I found a valid Ubisoft IP for running the launcher's proxy through (strike three.)And then it still only downloaded some of the DLC, and I once again just get to stare at a ""you're missing some crap, restart and patch me, bro"" screen (strike four).So in summary, I had to install malware onto my computer, utilize third party hosted files, and dig through Ubisoft's forums for four hours only to still not be able to play a game I own and the best tech support advice I was given was ""reinstall windows.""Absolute and utter garbage.  I only haven't sought a refund because I'm confident if I ever feel the urge to I could probably find a DRM crack for it and actually be able to play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What a great game, I came to Anno 2070 without ever playing any other Anno games, but I generally enjoy Simcity + RTS type of games before, but time from time I'd like something slower pace than say Starcraft 2. This game is perfect for those moments, to relax, think about how you are building your city, trying different things with research without fear of being nuked by some other faction. All in all, great way to kill a bunch of hours, and look at pretty graphics, the game is also very polish with few bugs in sight, which is a rarity these days. Would have liked more compaign, and a bit more depth to the city building, but perhaps in Anno 2080 if they make it.			",37,8,0,11,2,0,17

When this went on sale with all the DLC during Steam's 2012 Summer Sale I decided to buy it.The game is very immersive and the graphic detail is incredible! The voice overs are good and there is more listening then reading durring the game play.I had a hard time figuring out what to do to complete the missions but reading the mission brief to get the objectives helped to figure out what was left to do.If your a StarCraft, Sim's or Sim City fan, this this game is up your ally and you will enjoy it.

												My opinion may be a tad biased as I am absolutely in love with City Building Sandbox games, always have been. Anno:2047 is wonderful. It has far more in depth trading than its predecessors and it looks wonderful while doing so. The story is Fair to say the least, however the challengs are entertaining. I've spent a great deal of time in this game, mastering building placements, maximizing yield vs consumption. Like any RTS city builder, it has a slow pace, this can be offset by adding combative rivals that, when set on a higher difficulty, offer little mercy at the expense of perfection. It will change the pace trying to please the A.I. and expand into new territory.There is a plethora of other features that I have left out of this review, but I assure you that any fan of this game's genre will not be disappointed.

												As a long time Anno fan, this game blew me away. From the graphics to the switching between land and underwater, this game is truly amazing, the ability to choose between two major factions to build as is very cool and opens up a more in depth style of game play. To destroy the environment or save it? It's all up to you to make that decision. I would whole-heartedly suggest this game to anyone who enjoys city building games.			",132,11,5,8,13,1,24

The faction-based gameplay is intriguing and well implemented, and adds a metric ♥♥♥♥ton of flavor to the setting.

												Anno 2070 is a brain racking, Real-Time Strategy. The player has a lot of options of playing the game with different population types which can change up the type of resources and tools needed to build civilizations. It's heavy on thinking and has the need to take action on events in the world and make choices wisely, or else your economy may tumble. This game isn't military or war oriented, but the player has the choice to initiate or declare wars. Anno 2070 is very slow but enjoyable, laid back game. To those that are new to the RTS genre, I think this is a good start.			",133,3,1,18,8,1,5

												Uplay is♥♥♥♥♥♥ there is no doubt about that, BUT all the bad reviews are exaggerating too much, the only thing you have to do to no have any problems is download Uplay from the official ubisoft site before you install the game on steam, then it will take you about 10 minutes of patch and insert keys here and there and you are good to go. Honestly after reading all the reviews i was expecting a total broken launcher, but my experience wasn't that bad and the game is really awesome.			",287,40,14,21,25,4,36

												Buy it, download it, run  it, which in turn will run Anno launcher, there you shall copy the serial key, which will update, which in turn will run UPlay install, which will then update, there you shall register, then add a game and serial key, this will run the game, there you create a profile and add the serial key in again, that will unlock the DLC, close the game and run the launcher which will then download the DLC and open UPlay which will run the game... And then... Then you may play. It doesn not take hours as some suggest, but you'll have very annoying dozen(s) minutes and will have to install UPlay.Apart from that, the game is very likely one of the very best of all time in the genre. *shrug* Too good to not recommend it to anyone who likes the genre even a little bit, despite one of the worst consumer-killing DRM I remember ever seeing.

												Probably my favourite PC exclusive game out of my whole Steam library.

Game is addicting for perfectionists who like to perfectly optimize city spaces. Faction balance is good.Ecos generate far less money and their units are weaker than Tycoons, but enjoy farming taking up far less space because of positive eco balance, and units are FAST. Both sides should expand into Tech ASAP though.ARK upgrades carry over, my advice is to get a farm map going, fill your map with supplies, THEN go play with friends.

												Anno 2070 adds a whole new depth to a great franchise. And ""depth"" can be taken quite literal considering the premise of the game: sea levels have risen and civilization as we know it has sunken beneath the waves. Different factions allow for quite different approaches to the game and to the way you structure your colonies. (The Ecos who try to minimize ecological impact of their actions, use sustainable energy but require a lot of space, the Tycoons who couldn't care less about impact when there is profit to be made and the Techs...)Trade, diplomacy and quest allow you to interact with the npc  factions but to add to that, all players get to globaly vote on policies proposed by the factions and on which faction will get the council presidency. The result of these votes will grand some small, in-game bonuses.And then there are the little daily missions, which allow you to gain reputation with the faction you choose to favor during the mission			",204,127,0,74,35,3,64

												If you are big on the idea of ""Futuristic Age Of Empires"" type real time strategy, then this game may be for you! Lots of fun filled, thinking hours will be had, just in the campaign, let alone playing a ""Continuous Game"". Multiplayer is great, although, if you want to play with others, make sure it is someone you can contact. The game cannot be resumed without all players active.Features of the game are quite good, well thought out. The expansion ""Deep Ocean"" is a MUST with this game, as it will actually allow you to continue further in a continuous game. and actually complete a faction.I would recommend this game, only if you buy the expansion!!!! 8/10 for Anno 207010/10 for Deep Ocean11/10 for Anno 2170 ARRCP.S google around for 2170, you will be surprised :P			",61,5,5,6,10,0,3

												The building is just the surface of this game. The establishment of trade routes to sustain island social requirements to advance in technology is practially the main deal with this game. Throw in some optional piracy and otherwise rivals in one session, and you got a pretty interesting experiance that may end up with nukes launching from submarines. It is just multipayer can be somewhat, dead. Just because game lenghs in one session can last for hours and many competivive stuggles may just well end in the late game of total annihilation by units that usually are avalible +2 hours in game progress if someone were unhindered. At least it is better than the next ""Sim City"" or ""Cities In Motion"" disasters of current generation city building games.			",113,5,0,14,9,0,37

I feel satisfied as my city was developed into a metropolise. It feel so different from playing other games like the Tropico. I am playing as a savior of mankind in the future, rather than playing a dictator on a small island during the cold war.By the way, as a student majoring supply chain management, this game has made a great supply chain simulation towards my study (simple but not easy to manage).A Great Time Killer!

												This is a game that is hard to place in a certain genre, but it is defo a very good, well made game. It has rts elements in it, but they are very easy. The game is first and foremost about building cities and tackle the challenges of the future in terms of damage to the environment. It doesn't sound too exciting, but the story mody is a lot of fun and the game is gorgeous. If you want to be in charge of a city and decide if its main source of electricity will be coal or wind power, this is the game for you! I really enjoy playing it.			",141,83,0,27,32,2,19

												Probably my favourite PC exclusive game out of my whole Steam library. Anno 2070 is the most relaxing, managable yet fun city builder I've ever had the good fortune to pick up.UPlay is NOT a big deal here, I found the only thing affected by UPlay is if you steal this game.If you enjoy city builders with simple to manage yet deep economy stucture, exploration of small  RTS environments and connectivity features like persistence, community voting and customisation, this game is for you.

So many things about it just work and create a nice experience that you look for in a strategy game. The one thing I cannot mention, as I have not tried it yet, is the multiplayer.

So, if you don't have it installed go buy it. If you do have it installed, why are you not playing right now?			",161,20,2,33,71,1,54

												This game is very very good. I like it sooo much and I even didnt got any problems with Uplay and i really dont know why this Uplay is doing such sh*t to other people. actually i was scared when I saw all these reviews where was written that this game is not working cuz Uplay.  and i risked my money and i bought an ANNO 2070 Complete Edition and everything seems to work fine, when I installed it I klicked on play button and waited maybe for 3 or 5 minutes and then my Uplay came out and I synchronized pretty easily my ANNO from Steam to Uplay and I can access it trough both and play it properly without any problems. Maybe they did fix these problems. i dont know. i bought it on 2014 christmas holiday sale and it was pretty cheaper than if it was not a sale and i saved some money if it wouldnt work well and properly. thankfully as I said its working good for me. enjoyable and pretty good looking game. 8.8/10			",36,2,0,1,6,0,1

												I'm so disappointed. I did a lot of looking into this game (I thought) before I bought it and now I just wish I had spent my money on something else more entertaining...cheese maybe.Really though, the uplay client it forced me to install was annoying. The gameplay was very dull (and I usually love this type of game), and there is virtually no help anywhere when a problem arises with installation or loading...and problems arose...a lot. I feel like the devs of this game are just sitting back counting money and laughing at all of us for buying into this. Personally, I always take negative reviews with a grain of salt, and don't like leaving them at all. I wish I had listened to the ones I read this time.			",152,149,4,16,31,3,24

												My people don't always tell me to demolish my nuclear powerplant, but when they do, I can't find a ♥♥♥♥ to give.More detailed review:Graphics: 10/10 in my opinion. Not much to say, other than that pretty much everything looks beautiful.Music & sound: The music and sounds are pretty good and fitting but not the best I've heard imo 8/10.Ressource management and economy system: Tedious in the long run. You have to build ships to transport ressources from island to island e.g. island 2 needs Uranium for nuclear energy but uranium is only available on island 1. Unless you import them, but that is quite expensive. The devs did however add a feature that allows your ships to load / unload themselves at your docks, which really helps a lot and makes transport of ressources more or less autonomous. Still, when you start to have 20+ transport ships, it feels kind of like you have a major weakness should you go into battle with the other players. Like should one of them get destroyed whether by a tornado or an enemy, your entire economy on one island might collapse. I suppose it could be lessened by making every ship carry one ressource each rather than several, but that can become expensive to maintain money-wise.I don't give it less than 7/10 due to the fact you can make your trade autonomous (almost 100%) and renew your ressources (I'm honestly not sure if it's a good or bad things you can renew otherwise non-renewable ressources in rl such as coal...) but I also don't give it a higher score because...Well like I kind of said, the system gets kind of complex and annoying in the long run. Anyway, 7/10.Trade: Pretty much the same as above, you just make your ships autonomously load and unload their cargo at other players / AI's docks. Decent trading system, but I feel it could be better somehow. 7/10.Warfare: Simple and♥♥♥♥♥♥imho. What can I say, it's a sim game, not a war game. You do have planes, ships, submarines and some other things I can't remember, but it's not quite a good wargame. 4/10.Climate / weather events: As you can pretty much guess from the description of the game on its store page, your actions affect the environment around you. If you choose to pollute your islands, it could have dramatic effects on your economy, your islands and the other players islands. Oh and it can also happen at sea, so your ships might get destroyed by a tornado all of a sudden. I can imagine that climate system can lead to war in some multiplayer matches. Your people can also oppose some of your actions such as running a nuclear powerplant, fearing a meltdown. You can with techs reduce it to 0%, but the people doesn't seem to care :S Environmentally wise in this game...Let's just say you don't want to run a ""Business as usual."" policy for long. 9/10.Research and production: Research is insanely and annoyingly slow. You can speed it up and maybe I'm just doing it wrong, but researching new techs as well as producing things in your lab takes HOURS. Literally. Production of ships and other units is decent. It's great once you finish researching though, techs / items you can use to e.g. reduce pollution generated by your coal powerplants or techs that increase your production is great. You can also create...Items? That makes you able to dig up otherwise exhausted ressources. Awesome but also odd given how coal is non-renewable (in human eyes) in the rl. 5/10 due to the insanely slow research.Multiplayer: I haven't played it that much, but it's one of the few strategy games where I actually like multiplayer and don't prefer single player a lot more than multiplayer. I especially like how there are events and campaigns where players have to work together to complete them, followed by rewards if they succeed (they usually do) for example: ""Defeat this terrorist by destroying his bases in these 3 maps."" then players help do that and succeed if they complete the maps enough times (not repetitive though). One more thing I especially like that involve other players is...The voting. In the game you can vote for things which will affect your gameplay. It's been a while since I played the game so I don't remember the names and all, but you get to vote e.g. for a representative for the tycoons, which then will increase your production of certain buildings should they win the elections. Anyway, the multiplayer is pretty much similar to singleplayer, meaning it's not laggy or anything. I love CIV V but I hate the thing about having to wait for your turn more than in singleplayer. Anno 2070 doesn't have a similar problem to that, which is great. 10/10.Conclusion: I give this game 8/10. I dislike the way to wage war in this game as well as all the cargo ships you end up building in order to transport ressources around. Oh and the slow research. Buy this game if you like sim and strategy games, but don't buy it for the combat system as you WILL be disappointed. I was at least.			",197,46,1,37,31,0,49

Still I did have some fun playing it so Im still recommending it just giving it 5.5/10 stars.

												Anno 2070 adds a whole new depth to a great franchise. And ""depth"" can be taken quite literal considering the premise of the game: sea levels have risen and civilization as we know it has sunken beneath the waves. Different factions allow for quite different approaches to the game and to the way you structure your colonies. (The Ecos who try to minimize ecological impact of their actions, use sustainable energy but require a lot of space, the Tycoons who couldn't care less about impact when there is profit to be made and the Techs...)Trade, diplomacy and quest allow you to interact with the npc  factions but to add to that, all players get to globaly vote on policies proposed by the factions and on which faction will get the council presidency. The result of these votes will grand some small, in-game bonuses.And then there are the little daily missions, which allow you to gain reputation with the faction you choose to favor during the mission			",204,127,0,74,35,3,64

												Right so first off. Everyone here is complaining about how ubisofts little program is♥♥♥♥♥♥and doesn't work or that it = jumping through hurdles to play a game....I went through the process and what I got to say is...You people are bat♥♥♥♥♥♥crazy.If you have an Ubisoft account and you set it up with Uplay, and then link that account with Steam, you are good to go. It is very easy, and I never had any issues with it. Please don't♥♥♥♥♥♥on Ubisofts game because YOU are unwilling to go through the process of creating an account to play a game. The game doesn't deserve it, and I will get to that.Then you install the game with both accounts open and ready (Steam and Uplay, linked, if you are paying attention.)

												This game is so unashamedly awful that it makes me want to die. I would certainly rather do so than play another second of this boring dribble. Working the game is awkward and boring, it is overly buggy which allows the CPU to hammer you and even when played properly, it is your average city-building game with the same repetitive buildings, only far, far less interesting. The character background is so dull and the plot itself is just depressing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Might be a good game if I could ever freaking play it.

It is a pretty nice looking game graphically I think its mainly just personal preferance to why I dont like the game much. Still I did have some fun playing it so Im still recommending it just giving it 5.5/10 stars.

												Great game, relaxing and rewarding to watch your city grow. Many new game mechanics never done before in other games of this type, some diplomacy options and multiple ways to resove conflict, for example: economical domination, war or stealing all land for yourself forcing the opponents to confront you in one way or another.   Pros: - great gameplay mechanics - good graphics, animations (all buildings are animated).  - great amount of game customisation  (u can choose winning conditions, island size etc)- good balance between factions- tons of replayability- game never gets boring, there is always something to do and take care of. Cons:- AI is cheating - Unlimited resources, building patterns etc.. | its best to play the game on multiplayer mode - Uplay might cause trouble, you must connect through it to play the game. -♥♥♥♥♥♥Multiplayer servers, many connection issues when joining lobby (once the game starts its all fine) The game itself is pure gold in the genre, its the♥♥♥♥♥♥drm and issues stopping the player from getting in to the game that drags this game down. I will recommend this game but be prepared to deal with all sorts of random issues at your first install, or not if you are lucky.  ",49,8,1,4,10,1,11

												First and foremost, yes I know no one likes uplay, and I know it causes a lot of problems for a lot of people. With that in mind there does come a time when as a gamer one must ask themselves ""Am I going to let this annoyance keep me from something im really going to enjoy?"" I found myself faced with this very question in regards to Anno 2070, and when it came down to it I chose to look past uplay and see what this game had to offer, and I am glad I did. What we have here is an excellently made city builder game, with just the right amount of complexity and difficulty to provide a satisfying experience. Now it isnt the most intuitive thing so you will want to play the campaign to get a feel for how everything works before diving right into sandbox mode. So if you are into the city builder genre , be willing to at least consider looking past uplay and you will be in for something good.			",112,39,1,32,14,2,26

												Regarding the crashing issue. I just followed the steps outlined by 704BOSS in the review section and had no issue launching. I've copied his comments again. Review by 704BOSS :'THE GAME WORKS. Stop with the negative reviews because you don't like the installation method. It says on the game page that you will have to access it through third party software. If you don't want to don't buy it and move on. Just want to say the game works fine for me and it is a steal for the price. This installation does require patience as you essentially do have to install up to four multiple items. I already had UPLAY which I have never had issues with so that is the first step. Install UPLAY. Second step you have to install the game to your steam library. Copy the activation code. I already had UPLAY open and the game showed right up. Now it gets crazy. Select ""play"" in UPLAY. Another steam activation box will pop up and you will think ""I just did this!"". Do it again. This shockingly opens the game in UPLAY & Steam in unison. The little Steam box will be in the lower right corner. Now guess what? Enter the activation code. You can't past it so you will have to retype it accurately. We are halfway there! The game will now download something I think it called an ""adapter"". It looks like the game is installing again. Whatever it is it takes 2 or 3 minutes as opposed to the original install which took 30 minutes for me. Is it malware? I don't think so as I run scans for malware daily and have had UPLAY forever and none has shown up nor am I having performance issues. After the adapter is done installing you will think the game is going to start. It isn't if you got the complete edition. You now have to install the addons which are the DLCs. It takes about 10 minutes. Relax, breathe and follow instructions. It is a hassle but the game is definitely playable. Now do I have any idea how to play it? Not at all, but it looks really cool and I'm sure I'll have fun figuring it out as I love Civilization and this looks like a futuristic version of it. Time to read the manual!'			",27,2,0,3,3,0,2

												Uplay can be a hassle, but once the game starts its a dream. It works based on  the system implemented in the previous game Dawn of Discovery, but an environemntal mechanic and tons of multiplayer content  make it deeper and definantly place it a cut above Dawn of discovery. I recommend that any fans of Dawn of discovery give this game a try. I plays like a dream.			",104,2,0,7,5,0,12

												The reviews on this Game is what inspired me to actually write some reviews on steam.YES! I am the one person recommending Anno2070, why. Because its a good game dammit!Ok I will admit that uPlay is a bit of a pain in the balls and when you launch anno2070 it open and closes and 20 windows before the game starts. And the first time in takes about 15 mins to get through all the rubbish and set it up to autolaunch. But thats it, the game its self is great. Its an interesting approach to 'city builder' game. If you like Sim City, Settlers and simular games you will love Anno2070. I orginally bought this when it came out, the bought it again on the last xmas sale(don't ask) with a few friends and we all enjoyed playing online together over Xmas and New Year.Simply put, if you played and enjoyed any of the settlers games, you'll like this. Read the other negative reviews, see how many actually talk about the game.			",87,8,1,17,22,3,48

												Before buying this game I read all the reviews that talked about how terrible the DRM on this game is and how it was supposed to be unplayable. Well I decided to take a chance anyways and I am so glad I did. This blows cities:Skylines, Tropico, simcity all out the park, and I have played all those games quite a lot. This game just has so much depth, I am 15 hours in I still am exploring the game. I had to download Uplay, but other than that I have not even noticed the DRM. And for the people complaining about activation keys and how you cant change hardware without needing new ones:They give you 3 keys a month and will give more if you call. Bottomline for me is this is such an enjoyable game and its a shame all these top reviews are just people complaining about the DRM, so many peopl ewill miss out on this game and thats a shame cause it truly is really high quality.

												Anno is a real live strategy game that located in a mostly water planet in which the player needs to build up his economy to defend, attack or build structures to finish a level.Even though the game is 4 years old it's graphics still manage to keep itself up front with the new real time strategy games with amazing water physics and good looking buildings.The gameplay is pretty straight forward with objectives showing on the left and the map signaling the place of the next event, the game will try and keep you on you're toes in hard missions and new enemy strategy every level.The only downside of the game is the music, it just never matches the gameplay, the audio of the game feels random from a soundtrack and rarely fit the situation you are at. All in all the game manages to keep you interested until the end with an OK storyline diverse missions  and new tech from now and then I'll give it an 8/10Pros:- diverse gameplay- the only water real time strategy game- upgradeable units- long gameplay time- challenging enemies- good graphicsCons:- a bit hard to learn- the map is too zoomed in- random music			",605,213,14,83,67,5,92

												People are being extra vicious in the review of this game due to their hatred of Ubi's DRM interface U Play.  And, to play devil's advocate, U Play is dumb.  Ubi has made no effort to show their love for PC players.  That aside, though, this game is immense and engaging.  SimCity on acid -- Gorgeous, immersive, fun, challenging, everything you'd want in a city sim title.  The game is utterly fantastic, the DRM is a pain.  If you can tolerate the latter, buy the former.			",37,9,0,13,1,0,7

												I gave this a recommend, but only barely. As an rts this would have been epic 10 years ago, but as it is, its mediocre. The tutorial is non-existant, but there is epic loads of half useful text entries. The single player campaign does a fairly terrible job of introducing game mechanics to you, and never tells you certain things like hotkeys or how to actually accomplish some objectives. Other times it tells you in tediously small detail how to accomplish the simplest tasks. The game itself has some fun elements but they're burdened with objectives and game mechanics that seem to go out of their way to be cumbersome and unwieldy. Visually the game looks fantastic, but that is also the best thing you can say about the game. Voice acting is flat as hell, and the script is as well. There is 0 combat in the single player game for quite some time, and very little of it as it gets introduced. There are also very few unit types and some are exclusive to a specific faction. The lack of combat was a nice, refreshing, change in a way for an RTS to go in some ways. Unfortunately in implementation, it just means you're playing SimCity in an RTS engine for much of the early game. *I haven't gotten into the game very far, so if it improves I don't know yet. There are some interesting ideas here as well, that focus on the online component such as global voting and multiplayer maps. Now for the really annoying parts... you HAVE to install and load ubisoft's uplay before the game will even load, and of course this requires you to have a uplay account. Further, even tho you just loaded and logged onto uplay, the game will then demand you login from there! Once logged in you are confronted with a confused jumble of a screen and no guidance to it. The game will THEN recognize any dlc you bought and want your key(s), which will close the game and let uplay download and install it/them.. Now you can finally load the game and, login, then play..... WTF.			",39,12,0,24,9,0,32

												Interesting up to a point, but felt like I was always waiting for the real game to start. It just rehashes the same thing at you with a little added stress thrown in each level. I like city builders, but really this is less planning and creation, more a juggling act that sprawls. If you know what the MBTI is, INTP and INTJs will likely like this game. As an INFJ I didn't get any sense of accomplishment or satisfaction from making cities. If anything expanding was a hassle. Your towns don't even need to connect which made no sense to me.

												Works like a charm!People, who commonly dislike game are Ubisoft's haters or they just don't know, how to launch game. (Of course we're not talking about people like: Game is too complicated - NOT RECOMMENDED).So how do you launch the game?1. Make sure Uplay is already installed on your system2. Launch game and follow additional instructionsomfgh, steam shows that I don't own any DLC1. Check '' ADDITIONAL CONTENT '' tab in game. It's same issue for me! It doesn't show, that I own anything, but everything is already in game. On first launch, if you bought all DLC, it should download or ask to download automatically all DLC through updater.

												SimCity ain't got nuthin on this game. This is a new genre of simulation structures unlike the humble giants upon whose shoulders it stands, and I'm excited to see what direction it ends up going in the future. I would not reccommend this game for casual players, an average session lasts me a minimum of six hours. A longer one can run upwards of a week, all day every day. The tech tree and research system are megalithic and some.... several of the individual points towards a single given technological improvement can take upwards of ten hours to accomplish, which is mitigated somewhat by the ability to rush time itself with the fast-forward button, but that in turn is often thwarted by the extremely complex economic dependencies of your various population centers. ""Sustainable development"" in this game runs right along the razor's edge of perfect harmonization amongst a variety of disparate populations with, often, high demand for extremely limited resources.One of the more interesting things to note is that all of your 'sessions' behave as if they are simultaneous, so it is possible to have a dozen saved games all working on a single technological development project and shuffle the intermediary components back and forth through your ark. This level of ""meta"" can result in long term developments over a course of several revisited save-games but... the niche market for that is so rare, I again reiterate, this game is not very rewarding for casual players.If you're not going to spend the next several months playing one game, and only one game... or if you're not the kind of person who can sit around playing one session of the game for weeks and weeks... then this game's full functionality isn't something you'll ever discover. However, it does have a robust PvP/Co-op/FFA structure that can let you refine your ""early game"" down to a science of aggressive militaristic tactics and strategies if you're into competetive resource management games like Command & Conquer, or Star Craft 2, or Age of (Wonder, Mythology, Empires, Etc...).I could also see some serious potential in an organized 'clan' working together to develop the high end technologies while simultaneously working on their military strategies for PvP matches with other 'clans.' That would be pretty cool... I don't think there's another resource management game with this breadth of focus and variety of potentially successful avenues.In all, I love the game, but it certainly isn't for everyone.

												OKAYI love this game. I have put a good amount of hours into this game. The reason why I can't recommend this game is because Ubisoft. I have bought the game and linked it to my Uplay account. Several years later, I saw the game on my library and I figured I'd play it again because RECENT installments weren't exactly what I was expecting. I started the game but WAIT, the serial number has already been used by another Uplay account. I thought, "" wait, that cannot be. I only have one Uplay acc - OH RIGHT! I forgot my Uplay account details and password so I had to make a new one when I bought The Division."".Rather not wanting to buy the game again, I figured I recover my details from Ubisoft. But no. That doesn't work. Clicked on 'Recover my Password' only to have it redirect me to a blank white page. I went to Ubisoft's website to click on Account Management only to be presented with a blank white page with it saying nothing more than ""Invalid Parameters"". When I try to send which email address I'm trying to recover the password for, I get shown ""Error. An error occurred while processing your request.""I may sound whiny about Ubisoft's 'impeccable' websites and account support, but for good reason. I wouldn't normally be complaining about this, but I am only because it has been like this since last year. But at least the game was good.Thanks Ubisoft.			",90,20,1,26,29,2,21

												This game is great.  It's a very well thought out resource gathering and city building game where you have to balance everything.  Basic resources are combined to make better resources, which in turn need other resources to make even more advanced resources.  Resources are then used to create buildings and products to keep your people happy.  You'll also need to setup trade routes, use diplomacy, fight pirates, and more. If you like city building and strategy games you'll  really like this.  The only complaint I've ever seen is the Ubisoft Uplay game manager/launcher.  And lets face it, a lot of games have these 3rd party DRM launchers.  EA has their Origin system, Blizzard has theirs, Kalypso too, etc, etc.  Writing off games because of it is a bit much IMO.  The big complaint is that the launcher won't allow you to play the game.  I can understand that.  When you buy a game you just want it to work.  Well my Uplay launcher updated and it stopped working.  When I clicked play it would crash to desktop before launching a game.  A quick google search lead me to change a single windows permission and it worked perfectly.  After that it operated just like every other DRM launcher, just press play.  Get past this problem and you'll enjoy this game very much.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is like a watermelon. It has a tough outside, which can make it a bit unappealing to use, but if you choose to cut through that rough skin then you are rewarded with a wonderful, juicy experience. What I mean by this is that when you get the game you are faced with Ubisoft's terrible game service, Uplay. Nobody likes Uplay. But if you can get past that part, and find a way to get the game to work, then what is inside will be a very enjoyable experience.This game has a fair learning curve, in my opinion. When you start, you have no idea what you are doing. After about an hour of play, you get an idea of how the game works. After two, you become fluent. After three, you know pretty much exactly what you are going to do and when.As for various other aspects of the game, the graphics are absolutely amazing. It has really futuristic looking buildings, and all the terrain fits it will. The art style fits the game really well, and everything is consistent.The UI is okay, all things considered. It's nothing too intuitive, but it works well enough.The gameplay is quite good, although sometimes you have to micromanage things, which is not ideal from a city builder.The story is quite a cool concept. 60 years in the future, global warming has melted the polar ice caps, causing the world to flood. Civilization now stands on what used to be highly elevated areas, and survives on islands. The main method of transportation is boats, and they play a major part in all areas of the game.Overall, I give this game an 8/10.			",144,27,0,24,32,0,19

												In response to seeing all of the reviews of this game complaining about Uplay and such I've decided to write a review about this game. Here's the basic summary:Pros:-Pretty good graphics. -Gameplay is VERY fun if you enjoy micromanaging and macromanaging (empire building)-Two, technically three, VERY different factions. -Really interesting environmental effects-Interesting animations-Voice acting is quality-Animated 3D character portraits-Hours of gameplay-Fairly large maps-Fun multiplayer-Different ways to win-Fun campaign-A very unique and innovative take on a political system run by players-This is all I can really think of right now..Cons:-Always online bull****- Somewhat pointless DLC-AI is a bit idiotic at times-Civilians in your proverbial empire are VERY picky-Can be a bit glitchy with your resourcesOverall, it's a very fun game. I'd recommend purchasing it on a sale however. If one ever comes again. As for the ""it never works"", ""always crashes"" etc reviews, try downloading the Uplay launcher from their website. Hell, if you're that worried, download THIS game from THEIR website. Don't let anyone discourage you, the game is amazing. In my opinion at least. Personally I've never had any problems with the Uplay launcher or anything related to Ubisoft. Quite frankly, I find their reward system interesting and kind of fun. I'm honestly not sure what anyone is talking about when they say the Uplay launcher isn't working. Mine is. And has been. Not once has it buggered up.Anyways, good game. Give it a try, or watch some reviews.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not played alot of it yet but I will comment how I find it so far. The main issue people have with this game is the dreaded uplay function and yes I did have trouble getting onto the game when I installed it however there is a soloution that most people overlook and that is goto the Uplay website and download it from there, i've had no problems at all since i've done that. You shouldn't have to do this but people are just giving up because it doesn't work when installed so don't fear the uplay function i've stated what to do.Now the game itself looks good, I bought this because I liked the idea of city building and i've tried the first campaign mission which was very short but found it ok. The only problem I have with it is lack of tutorial information, there seems to be alot of things you have to do in game to keep on top of everything and it doesn't give you clear instructions, it's something you have to work out yourself. I'm slowly getting to grips with it and I haven't played this game before or previous games so I'm all new to this but I quite like it so far. The main reason for getting the game now was the sale otherwise I would not of bought it because I'm waiting for their next game in November which I was impressed with what was shown at E3. Do not be put off by the negative feedback on this game, the main reason for it being negative is the Uplay but it's not as though it's unplayable, you can sort that issue out yourself.If your interested in city building and the strategy of trading, making allies and enemies then buy it, you will enjoy it. I can't comment on mulitplayer as i've not tried it yet but I mainly got it for singleplayer anyway so I hope that helps somewhat in your decision to buy the game.			",5,2,1,2,6,0,1

												When writing a review about this game you have to separate between the actual game and everything around it. The game itself is great. I like it a lot. It is much like all the other Anno’s and yet it has a lot more depth than the previous ones. It is more challenging and definitely more fun. There is more than there used to be in the old ones. I also like the area that it plays in. The graphics are just beautiful and I think they are the best yet. The Deep Ocean DLC, though it’s not cheap, is worth playing and I would for sure recommend it. The game is a little annoying at times but that’s just part of the challenge. Everything around it, namely the U-play client. As many others said it is terrible. I don’t know why we are forced to use it when everyone hates it. Though is doesn’t seem to crash for me it just a mayor incontinence to open another app before you can play. I am really unsure why Ubisoft is doing this. Overall I like the game so much that I can forget about the annoying Launcher. I wish they didn’t force us to use it. Be that as it may I recommend the game seeing as you will need the launcher sooner or later you might as well get used to it. Ubisoft it just too big a publisher to boycott. (Thinking about Rainbow Six and The Division and many others that are coming later this year) ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Interested in city building and population control, with the added extra of resource production and collection? Look no further, Anno 2070 is probably one of the best, if not hardest simulation games I have played in a long time. A huge fan of C&C and Age Of Empires, trying something new is always a risky business, however I took the plunge with Anno 2070 and well, my statistics speak for themselves: 19 hours played in 2 weeks....so far! Albeit a bit confusing to start with, Anno 2070 does a really good job of immersing players into a new world, with focus on resource production and collection. Get it right, and the demand will increase, and meeting the demand will grant players with new buildings and more money. However get it wrong, population will decrease leaving players to deal with an ultimate decline in money. I would reccomend new players to give the campaign a go, learn the basics then switch over to Continuous or Single Player missions. These arent time constraint and you can play at your leisure, learning the basics and working out new ways to focus on resource production. A brilliant all round game, once youve gotten the hang of it, but hey, everyone loves a challenge!			",21,1,0,0,10,0,10

												This game is amazing. I will not tell you in detail about the features of this game, as other reviews already do, and you can watch gameplay videos to see for yourself. The chances are that, if you are reading this, you are doing so because you are already interested in the game, but the U-play rubbish is holding you back. So, this shall be about the U-play and DRM problems.Yes, U-play is a problem. Yes, U-play does crash and will not allow you to play until you fix it. However, this is a simple process, and this video shows you how to fix U-play crashing.

Other than the crashing, U-play does not hinder your gameplay, and this video fixes that. If that does not work, you can always get a refund, anyway, so buy it, especially if it is on sale (as it is at the time of this review). The U-play annoyance is worth going through for this amazing game. As for the 3 machine activation limit, you can just request more activations if you send an email to ubisoft support with your steam CD key. I have not had to do this, yet, myself, but others have stated that they respond quickly. Edit: I have now also found out that you generate an extra machine activation key every 30 days. Unless you are going to activate this game on 4 machines in 1 month, (your first installation does not take up one of these keys) this will not affect you.			",64,2,1,10,23,2,38

												There is a lot of initial problems with the game: But for me, I've not had a single one. No external, no internal. Nothing weird, everything is pretty smooth. There are some questionable software practices, but I believe, when doing a significant amount of research, you might just notice that the version uploaded to steam, is still pretty old, minus the dlc, which is of it's own interest.The internal patcher of the game, however seems to do a lot more work, even replacing the game's TASGES DRM, with SolidShield (Which is still TAGES, but under a different name supposedly.) But make note, that the store page is not synched up with the new name. It mentions ""TAGES"". Does that mean the DRM it's self has changed, or been removed?

												Ok, now I'm not gonna say only good things about this game even though I'm recommending it, because, I'm an Anno player and this isn't the first Anno I've played.So what's the main bad point? The main bad point for me is simple, this game is worse than the previous one. I had and still have much more fun on Anno 1404 than on this one. Not because it's not futuristic but because the gameplay was better. There was more thing to do, the venician addon was just awesome, and in general, the gameplay was more consequent. One of the main issue I had with 2070 was the military part. It has always been a great problem for me that this part of the game is left over by all anno game, but still, anno 1404 had a good military part. Anno 2070 has like, well nothing good. I mean, it take hell of a time to have a bit of real armed fleet, and there absolutly NO WAY to invade the land with man. You must use aircraft through the tech tree and this take even more time. Plus, and this is awful to me, the eco has like no military stuff at all... Well, just hated that from the game. Then there's the expectation that weren't there such as greater island, better diplomacy gameplay, more interaction with AI and so on. There's so much thing to do.Now, I still recommand this game for a simple reason. This IS a good game. Even though it was some kind of a disappointment to me, I've had great time playing it. The underwater ain't as fun as it could have been but is still intersting. The multiplayer part has never been use so well and that was realy interesting and new. And the elements such as energy and eco balance were quiet a nice idea.So I recommand this game!			",256,44,2,28,19,2,29

												Great and at times difficult city building strategy that makes you really think about planning ahead. Not much of combat RTS but it has these elements there.

												First of all: I rate the game, not the external software around it.For the game:Anno 2070 is just the best looking resource managing game right now. Your goal is to manage resources between islands with trade road and exchange and it's really well made.It's beautiful, it allows co-op or war, has a really big political management (you can vote for president and law etc...).There's missions and updates every month: it's still in developement. (maybe not when the new Anno will come)The context is respected: we're in the future but not too far and you can still recognize some of the buidlings we have now.The map can be big or small, with a lot if islands or not: it's up to your choice.Badly, if you buy it on steam, you will have to open uplay to play it. It makes 2 DRM launching. Plus, uplay uses their own DRM: Solidshield which can disable your game if you change your hardware. In general, Uplay hates PCs.Conclusion: The game is really good and don't deserve a mixed reviews but the software sh*t around it maybe.... ",155,7,2,9,19,0,9

												Anyone having connection issue when starting the game, this is what worked for me.I originally downloaded the game from steam and installed it, as you would any other game. It would keep crashing out and not launch. I then downloaded uplay logged into my account, re-launched the game and it worked (well sort of).Then when trying to play the game I kept getting an error 'connection to server lost'. This prompted me to go online for a solution, as up until this point everything I tried failed. I found a lot of information on this error, but nothing worked.As a last resort I un-installed the game and re-downloaded & installed it. This seemed to fix the issue, and the game launched with no errors.The only thing I can surmise from this is, not having uplay installed first caused errors in the game.So anyone buying this game or those having issues similar to mine, make sure you have uplay installed before you download and install this game.

												Yeah so, the actuall activation proccess isn't that hard.Maybe Uplay just decided to grace the gaming community with a shred of benevolence since this game came out but the installation and activation of a Uplay account has gotten pretty easy and fast.The fact that you have to activate the game with Uplay is still a ♥♥♥♥♥, but its no different than being 'burned' with the activation of SimCity 5 when that came out. Yeah you had to download another party to activate that game but it honestly didn't take anymore than a few minutes last time and if wont take more than a few minutes now.NOTE: If you do head most of these reviews and buy the game, keep in mind that you have to go to the Uplay website and download the launcher there rather than use the launcher the game gives you. But I'd argue that this is almost simpler than pirateing the game, just with a money investment.			",75,7,0,6,13,1,16

												If you enjoyed games like Banished, Age of empires or Empire Earth, I would recommend trying Anno 2070 out (assuming you have enough self-control to not go on a killing spree while trying to download the game through Uplay).I’m sure by now you have already read 600 reviews on how uplay is the worst thing ever (it definitely is, but I’ll get into that at the end). Once you get the game going it is fairly fun and I had no problems with crashing that other players have reported. The lack of a proper tutorial is kind of lame. But if you play the campaign and try out controls you would have used in Age of Empires or similar games, it is fairly easy to work out.The game looks pretty good and the soundtrack is nice to have going for around 10 hours. It is definitely worth while reading what E.V.E says, although she doesn’t always give enough information so be prepared to look some stuff up. The game as a whole is pretty good. Not amazing, but still enjoyable.The main downside for this game was the installation, which took a good three hours. First the game installed, then made me download Uplay, then Uplay kept crashing when I tried to get it to launch. I fixed this by just focusing on Uplay and not the game, starting the program in offline mode, logging in (it will stop you and say you have to be online), then logging in with it online. Uplay will do some stupid update thing, and then it worked fairly well from there on. However, installation was over! I launched the game, it installed some stuff, then asked to restart the game to do some more downloading. So I had to go back out and wait for it to basically download again. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There is a lot of initial problems with the game: But for me, I've not had a single one. No external, no internal. Nothing weird, everything is pretty smooth. There are some questionable software practices, but I believe, when doing a significant amount of research, you might just notice that the version uploaded to steam, is still pretty old, minus the dlc, which is of it's own interest.The internal patcher of the game, however seems to do a lot more work, even replacing the game's TASGES DRM, with SolidShield (Which is still TAGES, but under a different name supposedly.) But make note, that the store page is not synched up with the new name. It mentions ""TAGES"". Does that mean the DRM it's self has changed, or been removed? I think it may have been changed, and definitely comes in waves, and stages.Having the complete edition my mileage may vary- or be different for it all. The game is fun, it's great. So putting aside all of it's negatives, which are debunked when you do enough research- uplay is silly, but at the same time, the license limit/install is a non-issue,  as it seems to have been resolved, as long as the product is activated/launched, or ran through uplay (As well as Steam, if you so desire)Games fun, very slow, the gameplay is magnificent, its a resource management game, but it is definitely a beauty.

In everyweeks there will always have elections for the world in the game and everyone can be part of it. With the elections if any Tycoon, Eco or Sci are won the elections it all will effect to the Anno 2070 world later too. Is awesome and relex, yet the Island, sea, nature are so beautiful too !

Game 10 - Steam and Ubisoft 0I bought the complete edition during the summer sale. Eager to play I installed the game. Contrary to forum posts stating Tages SolidShield DRM is removed I had to download a .ske file to satisfy said Tages DRM. After that launching the game via Steam client worked for around three hours. Since then every attempted launch ends with a Windows failure message. I verfied the game cache and deleted and reinstalled the game in Steam to no avail.Next I unlinked my Steam account from my Ubisoft account and downloaded the game via Uplay client. This was successful and the game launches in the Uplay client in offline mode with Steam overlay active. Although all DLC is indicated as installed by Uplay Steam would let me happily buy all DLC again.How is the game then? If you like citybuilders and/or complex games it's a must have. If you have the patience to learn how to play a very rewarding experience with hundreds of hours of gaming awaits you. To grasp the basics I recommend reading guides and watching videos.As this review is about the game I give it a thumbs up despite the unholy mess of triple DRM.			",1263,510,44,142,109,6,165

												The good:- Pretty addicting, a single game could take up to 40 hours!- Good replayability.- Graphics are really nice, if you turn the settings to maximum abilities. This does require a high-end gaming PC.The bad:- Scumbag Ubisoft makes you pay for every little DLC.- Scumbag Ubisoft makes a multiplayer available for this game, but then forgets to actually keep the multiplayer running.The verdict:Addictive strategy game with almost endless replayability. For the time being my benchmark considering graphics. Keep in mind though that the new graphics card you are going to need to play this game on high detail is a lot more expensive than the game itself.			",79,6,4,3,12,2,23

SummaryAnno 2070 is proably the best RTS game ive ever played. Had no trouble installing it, even when i had to reformat my computer. Multiplayer is the most exciting part of the game as you get to participate in elections, world domination and world events which brings an exiting twist to gameplay. GameplayIn terms of the gameplay, the missions have been designed in a way that brings hours of gameplay in order to archieve an objective. The game has many of the common features that you would expect to find in a typical RTS game (such as Age Of Empires, Age Of Mythology, Command And Conquer, etc...). These features include, a Minimap, the ablility to adjust the camera and the ability to adjust zoom. However, there are some differences between the games. The gameplay also features a number of factions such as The Eden Initiative which takes an enviromental approch to solving problems, The Global Trust Fund which has a direct approch to solving problems even though it have a huge enviromental impact at the beginning of its operations however later on in the game it makes for that loss and SAAT which is unlocked later on in the mission/game. SAAT uses the latest technology and research to solve problems.  from which the player can choose to join depending on what gameplay is played.  Experiences And MultiplayerThe installation of the game is really simple, all you have to do is create an uplay account and steam will automatically link the game to your uplay account. After the patcher runs, the game starts up then it asks you to restart. The patcher then runs again to download the necessary files. Then the game will launch. In terms of muliplayer it ran flawlessly as i was able to play with my friends in world dominiation mode. I didn't need to port forward because my firewall/router has NAT (Network Adderess Translation) and supports UPNP (Universal Plug And Play) which automatically configures the firewall/router to open the necessary ports. In some cases you will need to port forward. It is pretty self explanatory, all you have to do set an static ip address on your computer, write down the ip address of the computer, go into your router, look for port forward, when it asks for the ports just put in the port that is required, select whether the port uses udp/tcp (some routers/firewalls actually support both). when it asks for a local/internal/start ip address just put in the ip address of your computer. Then click apply, you have successfully port forwarded. For more information on how to port forward, refer to the manual that came with your router/firewall or goto http://portforward.com and enter the model number of your router/firewall (usually located on the bottom of the device)			",35,3,0,3,7,0,12

												I absolutely love this game. I admit, uplay is a pain, but by simply running it as an administrator with win7 compatibility, I got it working fine.As for the game itself, it is a city-builder set in the future. Your aim is to keep your citizens happy while combatting pollution, global warming and resource deficiency. The graphics are amazing.You choose between two factions, the eco-frienbly eden initiative or the industrial global trust. There is an amazing campaign and a range of game settings, so you can customize your game to your suited difficulty preference.The best part of this game for me is the music. The music is beautiful, and I could sit at the main screen for hours on end listening to the menu music, ""God Smiles"".The game also features an amazing intro video. Usually I skip videos like this, but this one I was compelled to watch.This game will not disappoint.			",54,8,11,2,17,2,10

												I wanted this game really badly, and now it was finally on sale. So i took the risk and bought it, despite all the bad comments. The install took about 15 minutes, and i was really exited to see the game start. I already had made an uplay account, to be sure. I logged in, and then it crashed. I tried installing it again, didn't work. Then i searched internet, and found this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGA2U-jlhmUI did what the video said, except checking the 'always start in offline mode'. Logged in, and it worked!!I'm so happy now, the game runs fine. Hope it helped you! :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So, first thing I wanna say is that this game is WONDERFUL.I did a lot of strategic or city build games in my life outside steam, but I never found one like this.The best side of this game are the graphics: in your world u can pratically see EVERYTHING! It's really accurated.The gameplay is full of nice music and there are a lot of cool and funny buildings that u can improve to build a super city.Maibe you are thinking now: ""So man, if it is so good, why the hell does it have so many bad recensions?"".Well in fact, there is a little problem, and that's Uplay. You can't run your game directly from Steam, u need an Uplay account and sometimes it can happen that you need to buy the game twice because there are serial key problems or patch download difficulties.But I have to say that I downloaded it and played it WITHOUT any problems.Trust me, this game is amazing, and if you can get it for 9 euro... BUY IT!			",60,10,1,7,16,0,4

												Do not waste your money on this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game that requires you to be online even if you might want to play offline. Their DRM ruins the game. You will only connect sometimes. If you're lucky. If their servers work that day, if it doesn't snow, etc. I played a few hours, saved my game, tried to play again the next day and I am unable to connect, I get a message that says ""unknown error occurred"". I tried changing my password, I accessed the website and checked my account name, to no avail.  You might think you'll be luckier but look at the other comments that are saying the same thing: unable to connect.			",21,3,0,7,4,0,10

												The game itself is fun for a few hours and the game offers a new aspect into the Anno series and how it interacts with a futuristic sense. However in military aspecs you can not field land units and all you can do is field air and naval units.I got the game and the deep sea dlc for £8 and i go by a pound an hour if it is worth it and it has been so for me. 28 hours by the time of this review.However i want to point out after you see how the game operates, it becomes very boring and dull, AI on hard manages to take over half of the islands on a large map within 5 minutes to 10 minutes. AI is very ruthless and you will be eliminated within ten minutes. Factions are strange in terms, Tycoons are the best and easiest and the strongest, you will aways win with these lot. The tree huggers are useless and pitiful, they have weak ships and one good ship against Air units, while the Tycoons can bring battleships to the playing field. The tree huggers are useless because they are incredibly inefficient and require energy that costs incredible amounts in expenses per month. While Tycoons build a coal power station that significantly powers a settlement.The Tree Huggers (Eden initiative etc) costs a whopping amount of expenses to supply the population, because most of their needs is fulfilled from growing rare fruits and vegetables for drinks, Tea, etc etc. Tycoons require only alcohol and fish to upgrade in the first tier and alcohol is easier to cultivate than Tea, tree hugger farms require 4x more fields than Tycoons too.Then for the next tier you need plastics and vegtables to create conveniant food (Fast food), while the tree huggers require Fruits and another item i have forgot, which is a pain in the backside to grow.Techies are fun to have because they allow you to research new blueprints and new items to be used, such as hydro electric dams, and refilling depleted deposits of minerals on islands for your industry.Ocean DLC is alright but i was expecting to create underwater colonies, not supply bases which is boring as heck. Although unlimited minerals is a fun aspect, especially when a large island colony requires uranium to produce nuclear fuel to feed the energy grid.I have to say i reccomend this game for it's price and that i got my moneys worth, but if you plan to play this game for a larger duration, you will get bored of the game. The game is a dissapointment to the series as you are limited by the amount units you can have by your population number size.The game is very very very easy in comparison to the other Anno series games.It is a brilliant game to play for about 25 hours, after that you are just dissapointed by the repetitive gameplay mechanics. But i reccomend this game, as i go by £1 an hour and if i fulfilled the price quota of £8 (Including DLC) then i do believe the game was worth it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have no idea why so many people have given this game a bad review, except for the DRM. But, that was not really a problem at all. All you have to do is go to the Ubisoft website and download and register with Uplay. It's literally a couple of clicks. People complaining about the DRM are probably the same fools that would have a pirated copy - so use their judgment and moral code as your own compass. Very happy with my £7.99 purchase. I am a little disapointed that the instructions to the game were so terrible. I'm about eight hours into the game and I still have no idea how to do some things. There is very little to help you other than an AI that points out the obvious. Land warfare would have been good, but I suppose that's not the point of Anno.  ",0,0,0,0,3,0,7

												I am iffy on this game, as far as RTS goes this could be classified as it i guess, This game is more of an economy managment game where the winner is determined by whoever can generate the larger military.Yes most RTS games are oriented around a military victory, but the strategy in this is so little due to the fact that there are few military vehicles (easily made) and very few construction options. ( i mean it could have been more diverse than it is, more buildings and population classes to add at least some difficulty as well)I would not buy this for the price it is, ($50.00 when i posted this) Rather i would snag it on sale to try it out.I still play it a little however the multiplayer element is decent enough to keep me in it, but it becomes repetative the 3rd or 4th time around, And i have grown bored of everything else i have. But in the end the decision is yours on whether or not to buy it. (This is just my opinion after playing it)			",73,8,0,5,12,0,10

												I was on the phone with Ubisoft customer support for 7 hours and could not get this game to start. I had to get a refund because I couldn't get past the initial login screen for the game. It's a shame that I couldn't connect to the servers because I really wanted to play this game, especially with 2205 coming out, and I couldn't. Even though this game is on sale, I wouldn't recommend it. It's really sad that a game gets bad reviews because people can't get past an initial login or that Uplay ruins the experience.

												I am not a fan of games like this, at all.  I did not enjoy playing this for very long.  I did however really, really love the atmosphere, the little details on practically everything, it all seems so alive and the water, the exploration, and the city-building is vibrant, colorful and it just feels awesome.  That experience was worth it to me by itself, I didn't try any DLC because I don't have a great deal of time to invest in games like this or Civ, I'm an Advance Wars guy.  Shuffling trade routes and managing my standings with the rest of the governments was absolutley no fun at all, for me.

												uPlay sucks. We all know it. But we do this game a disservice to leave it negative reviews because the platform it's delivered on is terrible.Anno 2070 is great. Back in the day I played the original city-builders - SimCity 2000, Zeus and Poseidon, Pharaoh, Ceasar. I was always disappointed to find no modern-gaming equivalents to those games. I assumed gamer-kind had just moved on from good city-builders. Anno 2070 proved me wrong. It's enjoyable, it's challenging, it has enough of the familiar city-building elements to reward old players of the genre but enough new elements to make it unique, new, and interesting. The ability to store items on your ARK and transfer them from single-player game to single-player game is... well, it's a game-changer. One of my favorite things to do is run a dirty, environment-destroying Tycoon game, acquire the blueprints and parts to make a Hydro-Electric Dam, transfer that to my ARK, and then start a new Eco game with my clean, efficient dam to get things off to a fantastic start.I can't recommend this game highly enough. Hours of enjoyment out of it so far, and many more to come. I haven't even begun to delve into online play yet.Just... remember you'll need to deal with the horribleness that is uPlay, running a Steam-bought game. Still, buying it on Steam still feels less... dirty... than buying it directly on uPlay. And hey, it could be worse! It could be Origin!			",34,4,0,13,10,0,13

												Good game, very enjoyable. I bought it recently and I haven't had any issues with UPlay at all. Of course I already had it installed before because of Splinter Cell Conviction. With all the online only games today like Diablo 3 and many others I don't particularly find it a hassle to play online in this one as well.Some features are online only like the ARK and its upgrades but the rest of the game works fine without the internet.In fact as I write this, the Anno 2070 servers are down because of who knows what reasons but I can still play the Campaign/Single Missions as well as the Continuous games without issues.Now the game itself is absolutely superb. I am a long time Anno fan and its a very fun game all in all. There is a lot of depth to be found and its very easy to get immersed for hours on end. I did not particularly enjoy the military side of the game but its there and some missions are pretty hard. When I am playing games like these though I tend to turn those off in custom games.The multiplayer side is pretty empty from what I see, its an older game and few play multiplayer I guess. I personally haven't played even one so YMMV.Anyways if your not too hung up on DRM (if you are do check out GoG.com, its full of DRM free games but they are mostly older games) you will really enjoy this game. Thumbs up!			",84,21,1,17,6,0,12

												I have no idea why so many people have given this game a bad review, except for the DRM. But, that was not really a problem at all. All you have to do is go to the Ubisoft website and download and register with Uplay. It's literally a couple of clicks. People complaining about the DRM are probably the same fools that would have a pirated copy - so use their judgment and moral code as your own compass. Very happy with my £7.99 purchase. I am a little disapointed that the instructions to the game were so terrible. I'm about eight hours into the game and I still have no idea how to do some things. There is very little to help you other than an AI that points out the obvious. Land warfare would have been good, but I suppose that's not the point of Anno.  ",0,0,0,0,3,0,7

												So, first thing I wanna say is that this game is WONDERFUL.I did a lot of strategic or city build games in my life outside steam, but I never found one like this.The best side of this game are the graphics: in your world u can pratically see EVERYTHING! It's really accurated.The gameplay is full of nice music and there are a lot of cool and funny buildings that u can improve to build a super city.Maibe you are thinking now: ""So man, if it is so good, why the hell does it have so many bad recensions?"".Well in fact, there is a little problem, and that's Uplay. You can't run your game directly from Steam, u need an Uplay account and sometimes it can happen that you need to buy the game twice because there are serial key problems or patch download difficulties.But I have to say that I downloaded it and played it WITHOUT any problems.Trust me, this game is amazing, and if you can get it for 9 euro... BUY IT!			",60,10,1,7,16,0,4

												I am iffy on this game, as far as RTS goes this could be classified as it i guess, This game is more of an economy managment game where the winner is determined by whoever can generate the larger military.Yes most RTS games are oriented around a military victory, but the strategy in this is so little due to the fact that there are few military vehicles (easily made) and very few construction options. ( i mean it could have been more diverse than it is, more buildings and population classes to add at least some difficulty as well)I would not buy this for the price it is, ($50.00 when i posted this) Rather i would snag it on sale to try it out.I still play it a little however the multiplayer element is decent enough to keep me in it, but it becomes repetative the 3rd or 4th time around, And i have grown bored of everything else i have. But in the end the decision is yours on whether or not to buy it. (This is just my opinion after playing it)			",73,8,0,5,12,0,10

												The game itself is fun for a few hours and the game offers a new aspect into the Anno series and how it interacts with a futuristic sense. However in military aspecs you can not field land units and all you can do is field air and naval units.I got the game and the deep sea dlc for £8 and i go by a pound an hour if it is worth it and it has been so for me. 28 hours by the time of this review.However i want to point out after you see how the game operates, it becomes very boring and dull, AI on hard manages to take over half of the islands on a large map within 5 minutes to 10 minutes. AI is very ruthless and you will be eliminated within ten minutes. Factions are strange in terms, Tycoons are the best and easiest and the strongest, you will aways win with these lot. The tree huggers are useless and pitiful, they have weak ships and one good ship against Air units, while the Tycoons can bring battleships to the playing field. The tree huggers are useless because they are incredibly inefficient and require energy that costs incredible amounts in expenses per month. While Tycoons build a coal power station that significantly powers a settlement.The Tree Huggers (Eden initiative etc) costs a whopping amount of expenses to supply the population, because most of their needs is fulfilled from growing rare fruits and vegetables for drinks, Tea, etc etc. Tycoons require only alcohol and fish to upgrade in the first tier and alcohol is easier to cultivate than Tea, tree hugger farms require 4x more fields than Tycoons too.Then for the next tier you need plastics and vegtables to create conveniant food (Fast food), while the tree huggers require Fruits and another item i have forgot, which is a pain in the backside to grow.Techies are fun to have because they allow you to research new blueprints and new items to be used, such as hydro electric dams, and refilling depleted deposits of minerals on islands for your industry.Ocean DLC is alright but i was expecting to create underwater colonies, not supply bases which is boring as heck. Although unlimited minerals is a fun aspect, especially when a large island colony requires uranium to produce nuclear fuel to feed the energy grid.I have to say i reccomend this game for it's price and that i got my moneys worth, but if you plan to play this game for a larger duration, you will get bored of the game. The game is a dissapointment to the series as you are limited by the amount units you can have by your population number size.The game is very very very easy in comparison to the other Anno series games.It is a brilliant game to play for about 25 hours, after that you are just dissapointed by the repetitive gameplay mechanics. But i reccomend this game, as i go by £1 an hour and if i fulfilled the price quota of £8 (Including DLC) then i do believe the game was worth it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is my first review. Please be kind as english is secondary language. Anyways, I decided to do it on this game because it seems it needed a little love so here it goes :D First and foremost I did not have any problem with Uplay or the installation. The updates took quite a while though but everything went smoothly. Anno2070 is unlike any other RTS i played before for 1 thing... the meta. I mean, you could just play the game through the scenarios and go test your skills on PvP but the fact that you need to work with the different factions and you can participate in a tripled layered difficulty special missions given out by the said factions that changes every once in a while and other task you can pick up on main menu and complete it in any kind of scenario and you can also vote for the world council and such, giving different perks depending on which policies are active is pretty neat and then you get career points and unlock stuffs and things (titles, grades, custom colors etc..) for your profile. It makes you immerse yourself into the game while not in a game... if that makes sens... As all the anno games i played, it has a slow/medium paced gameplay with complex production and supply system. The underwater part is pretty neat too because it doubles the exploration fun and your base/city development opportunitiesThe game is kinda complex but the first campaign missions serves as a tutorial wrapped up in a good storyline. The learning curve is smooth. You get all kinds of resources and you need to adjust your production considering available energy and pollution. There is 4 tiers of em. Talking about the storyline. It is very clever. Also one of the few game to my knowledge that actually teaches a thing or two and makes you think twice about the course of humanity in a near future. The 3 factions are inspired by 3 actual groups. We get the greedy global capitalist inspired by the military industrial complex, the Eco''terro'' logist reminding me of greenpeace and the society of advance technologies which makes me think about Jacques Fresco's Venus Project. Ecologic disasters caused by human greed, master AI going mad because of a virus and such are all part of the intrigue.I would be very comfortable recommending this to a friend who likes the genre. The only con i would note is that you need to have some hours in front of you to finish a scene or else you will have to save and come back to it when you have time so not really a type of game you can enjoy at its fullest if you only have an hour to play. Thank you for reading my first review. Comments are welcome. Have a nice day.			",108,35,4,12,10,0,23

												Many have shown negativity towards this because of the most dreaded name since Voldemort; 'UPlay' (Voldemort 2.0). Now I agree, UPlay just came along and did its business much the same as a stray animal would, however if you download a standalone version of UPlay from the website, I found it didn't cause AS many issues.Now the game, Anno, I think is absolutely amazing, the graphics are beautiful, the gameplay is sharp and in cases gives you a more indepth style than other city builders. Three factions are included, meaning you can go down three different routes and see many possibilities, I've just covered 50 hours of gameplay and I haven't even seen that much yet. This game doesn't really play on the whole 'build a ♥♥♥♥ off army and march around the map' which is what i'm generally used to, but it does have warfare included in the form of naval and air. Anno 2070 is a game you really need to concentrate on, you can't just build anything you want anywhere you want all the time, because there will be negative impacts which come as low morale, poisoned soils, unfertilised lands and even the weather and eco systems can be impacted, so you have to pay attention to what you're building and where you're putting it. The Campaign: HOLY BALLS, I enjoyed every second of the campaign. It gives you so much to do and so many different paths you're always keeping an eye on everything, HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE CAMPAIGN. I'm going to include ratings or any of that, just take my word for it, even wait till this game is on sale if you want, just buy this game.			",111,4,0,8,6,0,13

												It's been a long time since I have played a RTS that would be as addictive as this one. I've played all the Annos so far and to be honest at first I was worried that Anno 2070 would be somehow alien to the Anno Franchise I know since it's futuristic and new and let's be honest, many continued games are trash nowadays. I've spent hundreds of hours of gameplay on Anno 1503 when I was younger and Anno 1404. Boy I was wrong! Anno 2070 is so addictive you'll spend hours playing it without notice. The developers include the lovely reminder of how many hours you've played on one sit and many other witty comments and names you might come across. The graphics and music are flawless, love it.  I've played both Single Player and Multiplayer and OH MY GOD multiplayer is so much fun. You can either work together or fight each other for world domination, how AWESOME is that? It might be bit confusing at first how to play with friends but all you have to do is add their ANNO account name - NOT Uplay or Steam! People complained in the reviews about the installation process but to be honest it was quite simple. It took a bit longer as you have to connect Steam with Uplay and update and use the CD key twice if I recall correctly but it's all worth it and not complicated at all. Maybe it's because I have the Anno 2070 Complete pack with all the DLCs etc yet, IMHO it's worth the little extra time you spend on activating and account creation! Hope this helps!Set sails and have fun playing!			",65,23,0,12,17,1,9

												Ubi strikes again. Their ridiculous paranoia is very frustrating. I will never purchase another Ubisoft game again. I can't even play this game. I activated the game through stream - then Ubi's player needs the activation key so I put it in there and link it to my old account. Then the GAME again asks for the key but THIS time it wont accept it as it says it is being used by another user! ARRRGgggg! It is not worth the frustration!

												For those who’ve never played an Anno game:Tthink a mixture of Sim City with light RTS elements and greater resource management. You build your city to meet the demands of your citizens while maintaining a stable budget, a steady supply of goods and resources, and combating any hostel forces (or passive aggressive allies). You set up trade routes with other colonies to buy or sell goods or transport cargo from one of your colonies to another in order to meet the demands of your citizens.If you've played any Anno games:Then you're familiar with how it plays. But the added twist is you must not only manage your supply chain and budget, but also maintain a stable environmental rating (that impacts both farm production and citizen well being) and meet the growing demand for power. You can choose to follow green tech which allows for easier environmental management but offers a lower yield in resources and slow expansion, or industrial tech that allows for rapid growth but consumes resources quicker and pollution. Both factions can be supplemented by a support faction that offers research into better technology. The underwater DLC ads more depth (pun intended sorta) by establishing under water colonies and expanding the resources and technology available to the player (Think the Orient zoned colonies from 1404: Dawn of Discovery).

												Where to start with this? On the surface, it looks good; A city building game combined with an RTS. As soon as you install it though, the issues start. First, Uplay. You have to launch the game from Uplay. Uplay crashes within a matter of seconds when launched from Steam. At first, I thought it was just my computer, but I've come to find that this is a commonly reported problem. Fortunately, this can be remedied by downloading the Uplay app and launching it directly. Still, it's enough to leave a bad taste. Upon launching the game, you have to deal with unclear objectives, an extremely tedious tutorial, and what is probably the second worst UI I've had to deal with. Even when you get past these problems, the game is just boring. Odds are, it won't be long before you just feel like doing something else. There's a better game under here somewhere, and because of that, I'm sure some people will enjoy it.

												This is a great city builder (with RTS elements) game that adds diverse scenarios to keep it from getting stale like more traditional sandbox city builder games that can get really repetitive after a few cities. As many have noted, despite improvements, U-Play is still a pain in the butt. However, I think the hassle is worth the reward of an awesome game. It really is a shame that poor business decisions have overshadowed the excellence produced by some very talented game developers.Bottom line: Would I pay $30 for an exellent city builder with RTS elements released in 2011? No. Would I buy it on a steam sale for ~$10? Absolutely. ",68,4,0,6,24,0,23

												UBISOFT Launcher ruins the entire game. The game itself is great but Ubisoft's terrible launcher program and online requirements make it impossible to play this game most of the time. When you try to log into the game it says ""a ubisoft service is not available"" and when you try to go to offline mode it says you need to log in first. This renders the game completely unplayable.

												While Anno 2070 is a pretty solid Real-Time Strategy game, there are many flaws that may put you off. Firstly, you'll need to run UPlay along(You will probably even have to manually reinstall it).Next the game's AI is quite literaly nothing but a facade. The AI doesn't have resources or need cities, it's just an empty very obviously cheating shell of an AI; much worse than previous, much older Anno Games with solid AI.There's also the seemingly minor, but still confusing fact that there are no infantry units; if you want to attack an island, you'll have to bombard it with ships or bomb it, which is often times overkill.It's still a solid game though; singleplayer is decent but I found where the game really shines is in Coop. If you and a coop partner can get it cheap on sale, it might be worth it anyway.			",235,43,2,35,46,2,73

The graphics for me are absolutely stunning, the idea and the mechanics implemented are just fantastic, and it lets you play at your own pace without sacrificing the overall difficulty.If you thoroughly read all of the reviews, the reason the game has a 68% positive is because 99% of the reviews regard Uplay not working. idk if those reviews are outdated, but if everything works like it should, you will not regret this purchase in the slightest. well, maybe in the first 35 minutes you will.

												After a lot of time playing this game, I can wholeheartedly recommend it. It's really well put together, the soundtrack is incredible, and the complexity is a true strength of the game.You start out as either the Eco or Tycoons, and spread your influence over a series of islands, competing for natural resources in a race to build up as quickly as you can. Resources are king in this game, and if an island that has a resource you require is small, you're going to possibly start a war with the other players over control of it.Combat in the game definately isn't a strength, it's basic at best. The units are generally very simple and don't allow for much micromanagement, it's clearly not meant to be a focus of the game. It's there, but it feels like it's only there because it needs to be. If you want to play a game like this with a larger combat focus, Civilization is a better fit.Speaking of Civilization, it's a very good way to judge this game. Anno in general as a series is very much as if someone asked what if Civilization was more like a traditional RTS, as opposed to a hex map, turn based game.If you want to see some gameplay and are new to the series, I highly recommend looking up NanoSuitNinja's Anno 2070 beginner's guide on youtube, it goes over the game very well.The biggest downside about the game is the DRM, specifically Uplay. The Tages DRM was removed a while back, but Uplay remains. I haven't personally had issues with it since getting the game, but that's not to say others won't.Overall, for what it is, I really enjoy playing the game. Definately had a better time with it than I did with Beyond Earth so far (review written before any expansions to Beyond Earth came out). If you're a fan of large scale macro focused games set in the future, I highly recommend giving at least the demo a try.Warning: The DLC complete pack does -not- include the Deep Ocean expansion pack, which is really the only DLC that matters. If you can, get it with that, it adds a lot to the game's tech, adds taking over others' islands by buying them out economically, and adds underwater resource gathering. Being able to buy out other islands is a very welcome addition and a way to take an island while avoiding the pretty basic combat.			",201,38,6,18,15,2,44

												I tried to like this. I tried very hard. I loved Dawn of Discovery: Venice, which was ANNO 1404. I liked the characters of Lord Northburgh, the Grand Vizier, and Garibaldi. Northburgh was especially likable. There was no such parallel in ANNO 2070. The whole thing reeked of a preachy AGW lecture. The corporate types are all stereotypically loathesome, and the environmentalist radicals are hardly much better. I'd advise you to save your money and wait for ANNO 2205, where they've apparently dumped the SJW crap for a more positive and hopeful future setting.			",113,16,0,27,15,0,22

												Well in my opinion. The game is good itself. But I still agree with the uplay problem, it always ask for a cd key and cd key and cd key again. But anyway if you're a patience person you should pass those uplay annoying question and continue playing this RTS in peace. Or in case that you're not that kind of person but you still want to play this game, I sugguest ""pirate this game"". It's a better option but you'll miss some of the great online features such as chaging ark model , political stuffs. Actually before I bought this I've tried a pirate one and I think it has lots of bugs and very slow patch release. So if you really want to play, pirate it and try it out if you think the game is fun and you want more features just buy it but I think  you should wait for it to be discount and then buy it.

												Disclaimer: I do not like the idea of Uplay layered on top of Steam and despise Tagès. It has kept me away from Ubisoft titles on the PC, and I almost missed this game despite being a huge city building fan.Anno 2070 follows in the footsteps of its predecessor, the historical based Anno 1404/Dawn of Discovery. There are several updates and changes to the user interface from Anno 1404 that try to streamline the many building options into a single menu. You can make your own shortcut menu and customize some hotkeys, though these functions are somewhat limited.The basic gameplay consists of establishing a colony on an island then growing it by ensuring the citizens needs are satisfied. Where the Anno series differs from most city builders is the concept of productions lines for goods on top of city management. To meet the demands of the people, the player will have to establish production lines of certain goods and ensure adequate supply to the colony. A player’s starting island will not have all the resources required to produce certain goods, this encourages one to seek out other islands that have those particular resources. Once the citizens needs are satisfied, they will advance to the next level paying higher taxes, and unlocking more buildings but also requiring more (new) goods to be satisfied. There is also a combat/military side where one can build warships to either harass opponents or outright destroy them. However, diplomacy and trade can also be used to resolve issues.There are three main factions in the game: The Tycoons, who are a lot like present day North Americans/Europeans. The Ecos, who I imagine would be like Greenpeace founding a country or world government. Then there are the Techs who are essentially the scientists/researchers. You can start with Tycoon or Ecos then purchase the rights to build Tech buildings. Eventually you can have all three factions once some of the player’s starting population obtains some Executives.The DLC to have (if you don’t buy the Complete Version) is the Deep Ocean expansion, as it really does expand the gameplay. It essentially fleshes out the Tech faction and adds new underwater production buildings. But it is also worth it for the additional campaign-like missions.In addition to the single player offering, there is also some online functionality, including daily challenges and a “Domination” PVP mode where you can play with teams and compete against others. Sadly there is no campaign co-op, but you can start a “Continuous” mode game with a friend. There are also World Council votes which give temporary (week-long?) bonuses in multiplayer or continuous games. I cannot comment more on the online features as I do not use them.All in all, this is a good game for city building fans, but it does come with a bit of a learning curve. I almost missed this great game due to terrible DRM policies (in my opinion) of the publisher, but I’m glad I bit the bullet and tried it out.			",66,5,0,12,32,0,43

												Everything wrong with this game is Ubisoft in my opinion. This is one of my favorite city builders as it focuses so much on developing your economy and satisfying your citizenry's need that yea there you can build warships and try to go war, but it's almost prefered to just buy out your enemies' islands right from under him.Now, as for what Ubisoft did right (a rare statement), the online actions are absolutely amazing. Every week everybody that logs in can vote on a senate and presidential vote. These votes can have drastic effects on in game mechanics. Such as currently while I write this the senate vote that passed increased all famr productivity. Every single farm building in the game is working at 130% efficiency. I think the other options were decreasing the cost of farms or decreasing their ecological footprint. This is an awesome game mechanic drivin by which of the three factions you like most, the tycoons (Consumers), the ecos (Environmental Advocates), or SAAT (scientists).The things Ubisoft messed up; as always Ubisoft's DRM and anti-piracy policies harm the people who actually paid for the game far more than it ever hinders the piraters. In game you have what is called your ""Ark."" This Ark is your starting point for every single game. Within the Ark you can place up to 9 upgrades that can greatly influence how you play by making the production of certain materials cheaper, influencing what kind of power source you use, and even how you control the environment. This is quite essentially one of the best examples of tailoring gameplay to your playstyle I have ever seen, except for one small problem. Those upgrades are in no way shape or form stored on your local pc. So if you can't connect to the internet, well there goes not just important perks but actually essential ones. For example Ubisoft moved their servers last year and they were actually down for a few months. During that time they said, ""Oh just play offline."" I could not play this game for that entire time because I, like may others and you will too if you get this game, had built everything on my saved games on the bedrock provided by those 9 upgrades. If I had logged in ofline and loaded any of my games at any point everything I had built would have collapsed faster than I could compensate for the lost perks. My power plants would have produced almost 50% less power so I would have had an energy crises in every city. I prefer nuclear power and had used some of my upgrades to prevent meltdowns, so the power plants I did have would have gone into meltdown, not only further causing an energy shortage but also destroying my ecobalance and thus rendering my farms infertile and subjegating my cities to the harsher catastrophes of nature such as tornadoes. Everythin I had built would have been destroyed simply because Ubisoft will not leave that information on my computer and saving it only on their servers.All in all I love this game very much, I have sunk over 400 hours in it and I have no intention of slowing down. As with any pruchase from Ubisoft you will have to weigh the frustrations of their DRM policies against how much you enjoy the game.			",103,4,0,26,16,1,22

												This is the dealbreaker for me. Bought the complete edition, haven't been able to play it once. Game either crashes, locks up, or exits out so I can see uplay ads. Not only that, but the DRM won't let me put this on more than 3 machines (assuming I get new computers and forget to uninstall), even though it's on my steam account. This all after an hour of jumping through hoops just to validate my CD key. Not only that, but from what I hear from friends who own this game, many of the components of the game have been disabled since the game got older. Certainly not worth 20 dollars, probably not worth 20 cents. I wouldn't know, since I never got to play it in the first place.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a really awesome game. It's all about building your own little city-state and provide all the needs and wants of your citizen.Unfortunately you have to get along with uplay which is, hands down, pretty much a pain in you know where. Still, can recommend this game to everyone who likes building his very own city, be it alone or with a friend.			",192,23,5,24,23,3,39

												If you've played Dawn of Discovery, its basically the same principal, except that there is way more to do. You have factions you can work for, you can even explore under the ocean, its pretty cool. I like the tree faction simply because the science guy and the other faction sorta annoyed me.

												I honestly don't know why everyone is complaining about UPlay, I hardly notice the thing exists, all you have to do to fix the crashing and the launch problems is open your steam folder go to Anno 2070 and change the compatability on the anno exe file to windows (pack 2) and there you have it, it'll run smoothly like any other game from steam. UPlay just really works as the launcher it doesn't hinder in any other way, so in all reality you only see the app for a second in return for hours of fun gaming.  ",78,3,0,6,3,0,21

												I am posting this more for those who had the UPLAY CRASH when launching. Dunno how many will manage to read this, but for those who will, I hope it solves your problem.The fix can be found here : https://support.ubi.com/en-gb/FAQ.aspx?platformid=9&brandid=22&productid=3957&faqid=kA030000000eSrvCAEI hope steam will allow the link as it fixes a problem and it will be less of a hassle regarding complaints for them.From what I can tell, the launcher in the installation pack is older than the one that is currently in use, and it was not patched again into ANNO.

												I personally Like this game, though uplay has its faults. I have found that on Windows 8.1 the solution was to set Anno 2070.exe to compatability mode Windows xp service pack 3 as well as setting all the uplay.exe files to compatability mode windows 7. As well as this I also made sure that all the uplay.exe files had been set to be allowed internet access by my fire wall. If for you Uplay has further problems then I suggest setting up your account via a browser first, then just login into game. Worked for me, hopefully for you as it is a great game once running. Though this should have been addressed by uplay/EA, still great game.			",51,3,1,7,25,0,36

												Is this a good game? Yeah. It's ♥♥♥♥in' stellar. But what really turns this into a throbbing horse wang in your a-hole is Uplay. If it actually wanted to work, then this would be a positive review, but hey ho, it's Ubisoft. Ubisoft can suck the sweat right off my grundle if they're serious about keeping this♥♥♥♥♥♥up. Every time I try to play Anno, Uplay shows up all ""yeah that's fantastic, just one second and you'll be good to go- actually how about ♥♥♥♥ you for spending money on this, now you can't ever play it"", and honestly, that irreversibly tainted this otherwise great game for me.If you really wanna play this, it's practically mandatory to search up a way to just bypass Uplay.

												Very cool take on the city builder genre.  I've played a fair amount of this game and still find myself trying to optimize the layout, design, and time it takes to get to mid-game content.  I really like the idea of owning entire islands, and eventually expanding to underwater areas while at the same time competing with friends for resources and quests.			",297,27,5,24,26,0,42

												Checked out the game and liked the look of it, being a fan of strategy + city builder games.Read the reviews and saw a CRAP TON of people complaining about Uplay. #SADFACEI thought ""meh, it's on sale and it's only six quid, I'll try and if it doesn't work then no biggie, AMiRITE?""Downloaded, installed, fiddled about with Uplay and got the game working in under 10 minutes. #Yee-hawScratched my head and thought ""why are SO MANY people struggling with this so much when I worked it out in 10 minutes?""Conclusion: there are many ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on this planet.PS: Oh, and the game is pretty good.

												I tried to like this. I tried very hard. I loved Dawn of Discovery: Venice, which was ANNO 1404. I liked the characters of Lord Northburgh, the Grand Vizier, and Garibaldi. Northburgh was especially likable. There was no such parallel in ANNO 2070. The whole thing reeked of a preachy AGW lecture. The corporate types are all stereotypically loathesome, and the environmentalist radicals are hardly much better. I'd advise you to save your money and wait for ANNO 2205, where they've apparently dumped the SJW crap for a more positive and hopeful future setting.			",113,16,0,27,15,0,22

												Well in my opinion. The game is good itself. But I still agree with the uplay problem, it always ask for a cd key and cd key and cd key again. But anyway if you're a patience person you should pass those uplay annoying question and continue playing this RTS in peace. Or in case that you're not that kind of person but you still want to play this game, I sugguest ""pirate this game"". It's a better option but you'll miss some of the great online features such as chaging ark model , political stuffs. Actually before I bought this I've tried a pirate one and I think it has lots of bugs and very slow patch release. So if you really want to play, pirate it and try it out if you think the game is fun and you want more features just buy it but I think  you should wait for it to be discount and then buy it.

I sure as hell hope Anno 2270 isn't this awful, or else ubisoft should just stop making Anno games.Do not download this game, infact I bet you you'd have an easier time PIRATING this game than buying it.

												Played a couple hours. Video card died. Bought new (better) video card. Game doesn't work now thanks to Uplay issues.Paid a bunch, played barely at all. Will never buy anything that has uplay, or is involved to any degree with Ubisoft again. ----edit---Thanks for the reply. Took a bit of messing around with uplay, reinstalling, changing passwords, checking settings till finally working. Still frustrating having to deal with Steam, Uplay and Origin (EA Games), I played every BF game since BF1942, but probably won't be continuing with their games either due to the added software issues, updates, user/passes, conflicts, and resource demands. I'll be sticking with just Steam games probably from here out. Just too much extra stuff on my machines otherwise.But the thumbs down is for the added software, not the game itself. After getting it working and being able to get through the campaign without issue, I have to say it's a quality game. Lots to do, nice graphics, some interesting features, decent interface, and a decent length campaign. I give the game a thumbs up, but the added software that has to go with it a thumbs down. So to anyone that doesn't mind the added software, or already has Uplay in good working order, I do recommend this game.			",24,13,0,4,10,0,9

												Everything wrong with this game is Ubisoft in my opinion. This is one of my favorite city builders as it focuses so much on developing your economy and satisfying your citizenry's need that yea there you can build warships and try to go war, but it's almost prefered to just buy out your enemies' islands right from under him.Now, as for what Ubisoft did right (a rare statement), the online actions are absolutely amazing. Every week everybody that logs in can vote on a senate and presidential vote. These votes can have drastic effects on in game mechanics. Such as currently while I write this the senate vote that passed increased all famr productivity. Every single farm building in the game is working at 130% efficiency. I think the other options were decreasing the cost of farms or decreasing their ecological footprint. This is an awesome game mechanic drivin by which of the three factions you like most, the tycoons (Consumers), the ecos (Environmental Advocates), or SAAT (scientists).The things Ubisoft messed up; as always Ubisoft's DRM and anti-piracy policies harm the people who actually paid for the game far more than it ever hinders the piraters. In game you have what is called your ""Ark."" This Ark is your starting point for every single game. Within the Ark you can place up to 9 upgrades that can greatly influence how you play by making the production of certain materials cheaper, influencing what kind of power source you use, and even how you control the environment. This is quite essentially one of the best examples of tailoring gameplay to your playstyle I have ever seen, except for one small problem. Those upgrades are in no way shape or form stored on your local pc. So if you can't connect to the internet, well there goes not just important perks but actually essential ones. For example Ubisoft moved their servers last year and they were actually down for a few months. During that time they said, ""Oh just play offline."" I could not play this game for that entire time because I, like may others and you will too if you get this game, had built everything on my saved games on the bedrock provided by those 9 upgrades. If I had logged in ofline and loaded any of my games at any point everything I had built would have collapsed faster than I could compensate for the lost perks. My power plants would have produced almost 50% less power so I would have had an energy crises in every city. I prefer nuclear power and had used some of my upgrades to prevent meltdowns, so the power plants I did have would have gone into meltdown, not only further causing an energy shortage but also destroying my ecobalance and thus rendering my farms infertile and subjegating my cities to the harsher catastrophes of nature such as tornadoes. Everythin I had built would have been destroyed simply because Ubisoft will not leave that information on my computer and saving it only on their servers.All in all I love this game very much, I have sunk over 400 hours in it and I have no intention of slowing down. As with any pruchase from Ubisoft you will have to weigh the frustrations of their DRM policies against how much you enjoy the game.			",103,4,0,26,16,1,22

												After having been playing this game for the last couple of weeks, I can say that this is from my point of view the best Anno game yet. I have lots of fun playing it. After completing the campaign, I tackled the scenarios. I really enjoyed all of them. In every single game, you get to the point where you just want to optimize this one little thing before starting the next game which is so damn addictive. The expansion brings the complexity of your production chains to a more challenging and, from my point of view, to a better level.Originally, I hesitated buying this based on all the negative reviews. From my point of view, they are simply not justified. UPlay pretty much is as good as or as bad as Steam. I haven't had a problem with it. The only thing I really don't like about Ubisoft's politics here is that they apparently stopped the world events which add some variety and provide additional challenges as well as achievements to the game. From my point of view, that's bad customer treatment but at the end of the day, I had and probably will have for some more time lots of fun with this great game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you can get past Uplay constantly crashing, you're still going to find a mediocre game.The campaign and missions are slow and completely obtuse. Random stuff will happen (such as your main food source becoming “rotten” and driving out your population) and the game will give you no direction as to how to proceed. Most of the mission objectives consist of moving an item from Warehouse A to Warehouse B with your flagship and back again. There isn't really a story and the plot that's there is soft at best. You have to sit through lazy, in-game cut scenes featuring voice acting that teeters between dull and grating.None of that would really be a problem if a bunch of customization options weren't held hostage by campaign completion objectives. This game is at its best in its sandbox mode where you're left alone to create your own story and it sucks that you're forced to go through some tedious, disjointed missions just to get the most out of the free-form experience.Not to say that sandbox (or continuous play) is a joy. The city building feels a little A-to-B as well. The point of the game seems to be to court and sustain the most advanced members of a given faction who require more and more elaborate forms of resources and industry. Personally, I found it kinda' pointless. There doesn't seem to be an end game other than to overtake the other factions via slow attrition of resources. It lacks the historic charm of 1404 (or Dawn of Discovery for us folks in the US) so it's harder to invest emotionally or mentally in your little islands.Again, none of that really matters because you'll probably have to spend an hour or two just trying to get the game to work on your machine after purchasing it, then again and again every time Uplay decides to throw a tizzy. I don't really think that the gameplay is worth the price of entry and not just in terms of monetary value but also the time investment you'll most likely have to allow to troubleshoot. In fact, maybe it has an amazing end game, filled with vibrant strategy and solutions, but I will never know for sure because the technical issues are enough to turn me off the game permanently.Oh, and micro-transactions are, of course, available and well advertised. Because that nonsense is always representative of a top-notch gaming experience. ",19,7,0,7,5,0,3

												I tried to like this. I tried very hard. I loved Dawn of Discovery: Venice, which was ANNO 1404. I liked the characters of Lord Northburgh, the Grand Vizier, and Garibaldi. Northburgh was especially likable. There was no such parallel in ANNO 2070. The whole thing reeked of a preachy AGW lecture. The corporate types are all stereotypically loathesome, and the environmentalist radicals are hardly much better. I'd advise you to save your money and wait for ANNO 2205, where they've apparently dumped the SJW crap for a more positive and hopeful future setting.			",113,16,0,27,15,0,22

												I was sceptical, given the negative reviews, but I pushed the boat out when it was on sale and I do not regret my choice.I agree that uplay is an annoyance, but it's only a mild annoyance. If you have half a brain and little patience, you'll reap the reward. The game is beautiful and is the perfect blend of SimCity and Command & Conquer. I can't keep away.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well in my opinion. The game is good itself. But I still agree with the uplay problem, it always ask for a cd key and cd key and cd key again. But anyway if you're a patience person you should pass those uplay annoying question and continue playing this RTS in peace. Or in case that you're not that kind of person but you still want to play this game, I sugguest ""pirate this game"". It's a better option but you'll miss some of the great online features such as chaging ark model , political stuffs. Actually before I bought this I've tried a pirate one and I think it has lots of bugs and very slow patch release. So if you really want to play, pirate it and try it out if you think the game is fun and you want more features just buy it but I think  you should wait for it to be discount and then buy it.

												Ubisoft should go bankrupt for ever releasing a game like this with the DRM it has. It's taken me 4 hours to get this game running, and only when I've had to edit group policies to get this garbage working do I have uplay crash my game and redownload files. I sure as hell hope Anno 2270 isn't this awful, or else ubisoft should just stop making Anno games.Do not download this game, infact I bet you you'd have an easier time PIRATING this game than buying it.

												Most of the people couldn't play it because of the beginning of Uplay.But now, it has been patched to work with Steam, you'll still have to install Uplay but you won't have to buy the game another time or whatever other problem they encountered. It works just fine now.Concerning the game, it's the most beautiful game of that kind I played and you'll be expected to spend over 200+ hours at least to find 75% of its content. A real long-time investment. Each one of the three ""civilization"" has been fully worked on, and you'll need to manage the three of them to discovered the most beautiful part of the game.It's a game that requires good managing and planning skills, and otherwise, train you about these. The best thing to do on this game is a cooperation game. Again, all problems with the multiplayer has been removed as I didn't encountered one throughout the entire year. Playing this game in cooperation will enable to split the tasks, what will make you enormous gain in time and optimization (as long as you get along with your partner about the planning, but it's abvout the game). Seriously, if you like this kind of game and want to make a real long time investment (although Anno 2205 is coming), this game is perfect to you.For the cons, I find this game perhaps too long (I play offline so don't think I'm only about 30hours on this game) and although it is beautiful, the weak computers will suffer on it. I've chosen medium/high graphics to play Anno 2070, and I did the same for GTAV ( around 35fps).			",105,22,1,13,10,0,11

												My Vista found it difficult to show all the graphics to its best, but with a bit of experimenting in the options menu, it now looks as stunning as any other game.Gameplay is great, story not important - the most annoying thing about it is EVE's voice and repetitive nature of what she says (yes I know the fisheries have broken down, okay?) The one thing that might be a downer is the way to play multiplayer - it took us ages to work it out. It is essentially a micromanagement game and takes a long time to get used to, but it is extremely rewarding. My advice is to give it a go. If it works on my shoddy computer it will work on yours.Update: New laptop (8.1) and the game has shown no problems whatsoever. Multiplayer's fine too.10/10			",34,7,0,9,2,0,5

												Never ever buy this game!The game itself is good but there is a high chance that you won't be able to play it. I know that because I'm not the only person. The game will ask send you to an external launcher called Uplay. It is literally broken and supports nothing. You can't play the damn game without internet connection anyway. There is no offline choice at all! With that annoying broken launcher and its prehistoric system, Ubisoft is a great disappointment. If it has been a while since you bought the game (like myself), Steam will never give a refund for it. As if I could play it one second! I suggest everyone to never buy any games from Ubisoft. And after having that cold ""We won't refund anything"" email from Steam, I guess I have lost my trust for Steam too.			",16,4,0,4,5,0,9

												Great game but hard to believe a company would cut it's own throat with the ridiculous DRM.  I want to get the new one coming up (2205?)  but if these types of reviews continue in that game, I will not pay a dime for it.  Take a hint from your fans Ubisoft.  People that like the game and want to pay for it will, the people that don't will still pirate it and play it with the DRM removed.  You're beating up on your fans, not the pirates.

												Can't even lauch the game thanks to UPlay crashing everytime I lauched on the first few attempts. Had to uninstall Uplay when it installed through the game when I first launched Annon 2070, I uninstall that version of Uplay and downloaded the client on the actual website (Thanks to Keng's instructions). Game seems ok... just hate playing through Uplay or Origin when I purchased a game through Steam			",140,48,1,28,9,3,32
