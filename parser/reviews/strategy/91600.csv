Personal rating: 8/10DLC: Worth it. New, more challenging maps. A nice addition to a short core game.What is Sanctum?Sanctum is a completely different take on the ""Tower Defense"" genre, it mixes up First Person Shooter elements in it and it does it well.About the gameplay:Here's the catch: If you have your mind set on ""I'll only upgrade Towers!"" or ""I'll just shoot everything!"", you're in for an embarrassing defeat. You cannot take everything head on here, you need to balance resources to deal with everything coming towards you: enemies that comes in large quantities, tough ones and tricky ones.Do you want to do the heavy lifting and shoot most of what's coming or use your towers while you kill whatever is left by the end? Or maybe you want to do both of these things? No problem, all three options are possible in this game.One of Sanctum's most known aspects is the maze building, you've got room and resources to create your personal enemy slaughtering course, it's far from putting one block here and another over there. If you want to survive the toughest levels of Sanctum you'll need to smart up and create mazes that will force enemies to walk as much as they can.Something that should be noted:Unlike Sanctum 2, there is absolutely no grinding in Sanctum 1. You start with everything the game gives you and after a short, optional, Tutorial you're free to do whatever you feel like in the first map. Play and learn, no hand holding here aside from the absolutely necessary.Tower Defense, because calling it ""Resource Management"" sounds like a boring disciplineBalancing resources here can be tough, they are rather scarce early on and woe betide the unprepared. Do you upgrade your towers or your guns? A difficult choice that can be the difference between victory or defeat. Towers and Weapons can be upgraded up to Level 6, and while they seem extremely cheap at first don't go thinking you can leave a bunch of Level 1 towers scattered and expect them to do heavy damage; enemies gets progressively stronger and soon you'll realize even your Level 3 towers are hardly doing any significant damage. And the same will apply to your guns if you ignore them.Upgrades will considerably power up your towers and guns, however they'll also become incredibly expensive and on shorter Campaign maps (with 20 or less waves), chances are, you won't be having lots of Level 6 towers even by the end of the map unless you focus more on them.Sanctum: Not an easy gameIf you are looking for a difficult game, Sanctum may be your cup of tea. The game is ruthless, but hardly unfair. It punishes poor planning and poor shooting accuracy and you'll probably be frustrated once you see that your carefully planned maze and towers did not work, but amazed when you beat that tough wave with your wits.The greatest challenge at the start is to understand how to balance your resources between weapons and towers, and until you find your own balance point, you'll be hitting that ""Load Checkpoint"" button quite often.The game is merciless and will not shy away from dropping tough enemies, although not without warning: the game provides a list for a number of incoming waves and what will be there. However Sanctum fail in one crucial point: there is no indication on how resilient the enemies will be. In one wave you may face a single, but extremely resistant, enemy and at the other wave the same type of enemy in larger numbers, however with much less HP. This can and will catch you off guard and is one of the very few times the game will play ""dirty"".For those wishing an even greater challenge there is the Insane difficulty with VERY resistant enemies and a core as fragile as cracked glass.Sanctum, where the simplest level can take 1 hour to complete.Every level can be VERY long. Even the first one can take anywhere between 30 minutes (if you are insanely fast) to 1 hours and a half and can last even longer. But don't worry: the Campaign has checkpoints between waves which you can also use to correct a mistake as long your have enough resources. It may sound cheap, but picking the ""Load Checkpoint"" will be something you'll do often here unless you feel there is no hope and click on the ""Restart Level"".The multiplayer option ramps this up by letting you set the game to 30 waves on any map, which easily means games going past 1 hour.Multiplayer Mayhem (Single if you must)The multiplayer in Sanctum is a bit different. Instead of a normal game with fixed waves every game on every map will have random enemies waves coming for you and your friends, that's right, no game will be quite the same and sometimes you'll be forced to change your tactics since the game can be downright mean sending airborne enemies and another wave of tricky enemies right away.You can also change how long the game will last: from 10 to 20 or even 30 waves, or an endless Survival mode, with increasingly stronger enemies, but with MUCH more resources than the normal, single player only, Campaign. This means more towers, faster weapon upgrades and more towers.Don't have friends that play Sanctum? Friends can't play right now? No problem. You can Host a game like this and play by yourself if you wish to, or leave open to friends (or other people) so they can join during it. You can also opt to play with people from the world but be warned: the Sanctum multiplayer is fairly dead and even on weekends it may be hard to get a lasting game with someone.Multiplayer has a few problems, though. Once you finish a map you are forced to create a new game and invite your friends again which doesn't sound bad, but gets annoying if you play with 2 or more people. It may be also a pet peeve mine, but you don't get levels achievements even if you do complete them with 30 waves setting, however you do keep progress from others like ""Kill 4000 Runners""Music for your earsSanctum also has an amazing soundtrack, much more relaxing and soothing than what you'd expect for a game about killing hordes of enemies while hearing the heroine laughing and screaming in glee.For some the music will feel strangely out of place and annoying, for others it will be a contribution to immerse the player.Final notesThe game came out in 2011, and even on 2014 it remains one of the most pleasant, satisfactory games to play. Unfortunately Sanctum is often underrated and overlooked by people, sometimes because of its graphics and sometimes because it is a game that takes time to learn and it won't be afraid to slap you in the face quite often while you learn it.Sanctum is a game created with care and you can notice it as you play. Coffee Stain Studios did a good job with this game and it is worth your money and time. Even if you are not a fan of Tower Defense or First Person Shooter genres, give Sanctum a try at least in the demo, you may be surprised.			",222,43,3,24,9,0,13

												Honestly one of the best tower defense games I've ever played. Being forced to pick a limited set of towers and weapons to use for each level adds a nice extra level of challenge in both solo and co-op play as knowing which towers to bring into play, when to bring them out and where to place them is easily the key.By far this game is better co-op.

												   If you are reading this review right now, and consider buying the game, do it. It's that simple, the game is totally worth the money. First of all, it's a First Person Shooter Tower Defense game. It's rules are simple:- Choose your personal Towers and Weapons.- Build blocks to create a maze as big as possible. - Build towers using resources that you gain for completing waves.- Upgrade your gear and towers.- Defend the core at all cost.   Sanctum has this good feeling of progression. Each new wave provides another, a more difficult challenge. And the player must keep up. By upgrading the towers and weapons. Which by the way, come in a surprisingly pleasant number. There are a lot of different towers to choose from. Some are used to deal damage to the creatures on the ground, and some to those airborn. So it's a good idea to buy them both, and experiment with their placement. Another very nice addition, are the ""Support Towers"". They can manipulate your enemies in various ways. The ""Slow Field"" for example, slows every creature that steps on the ground where it's placed. There also towers that amplify both yours and your tower's attacks, make your enemies more susceptible to damage, and so on. Speaking of enemies, each type of creature has it's own good looking alien body. That comes with a certain, sometimes hidden, area called the ""Weakspot"". Each alien has it's own unique abilities, like ""Charging"", ""Soaking"", ""Dodging"", well, you get the point. They not only behave differently, but also look so. Very cool and fantastic-looking models.   Your towers are the main source of firepower in Sanctum. But the player is as important. You get to choose from 6 unique weapons like the ""Sniper"", ""Freeze"",and ""Tesla"" guns. Which come in very handy when dealing with certain enemies. Especially those that somehow survived your defenses. You can create some really awesome guns and towers combinations if you think about it. You could, for example, use your ""Freeze"" gun to temporarily stun all the enemies in a certain radius. And then blow them all away with a charged ""REX"". It's really awesome come to think about it.   Another thing worth mentioning is the variety of maps (16 if have the DLCs) and game mods (like Bounty, Stamina, Pre-Build, and Standart). Which add a certain feeling of freedom. And the maps are pretty awesome. They look vibrant and alive, full of fauna and flora. Which is so strange looking that it makes you love it. Giant spores, glowing trees, multiple Suns, huge flowers, and mineral-rich caves. But the best thing about the maps, are the Easter Eggs. There are so many secret spots to find. So well-hidden and camouflaged, that you'll spend some time looking for them, and when you'll finally find them, they'll put a smile on that face.    And now, my favorite subject, the Music. I never thought I'd enjoy Sanctum's music so much as I do. Every map has 2 pieces of music attached to it. The first one plays in the ""Building"" phase. Usually a rather slow and tuneful loop, which I always like. And the second piece plays while the ""Action"" phase is in progress. A very pulsing, rhythmic and dynamic song, that I just love. Just listen to THIS or THIS. Please do, they might seem simple and plain, but they feel so complex and sparkling. 16 different maps, 2 songs for each... You do the math. All the credit goes to Coffee Stain Studios, and more specificaly to the genius Gustaf Tivander.   The last but not least, the best feature of this game is the Cooperative play. You and up to three of your friends get to build, upgrade and defend together. It's fun and effective, it grants even more creativity and firepower. Letting you get the most of this game. Which I strongly recommend if you're looking for either a good Co-op, or Tower Defense. 10/10 ",310,62,8,27,25,2,21

												Short version: A big surprise. If you like tower defense at all and don't mind FPS, give it a shot. A great blend of strategy + action.Long version: Sanctum is great for TD fans that either like or don't mind some FPS action in their games. The two aspects blend together very well; on lower difficulties, one can pretty easily focus on one over the other and do fine, while on higher difficulties both are needed pretty equally. Additionally, there are towers that help your shots and a gun that helps your towers, ensuring that the two aren't just separate parts of the same game but actually integrated together.Even aside from FPS tactics, there's a fair amount more strategy than in most TD games, as the player must build a map for the enemies to travel on and building good maps can be necessary for survival. Building a map that makes enemies take longer to travel necessarily means less space for defensive towers, balancing the game with a choice of longer path or more firepower. And of course, correct positioning of towers for the most effective use of each one is as important as always in a TD game. Even the size of certain towers can be a strategic point for ensuring the player can move around flexibly.One can bring 3 different guns and up to 6 different towers to maps, ensuring many different ways to play the game, although the total number of guns and towers may be a bit low to take full advantage of that.If there's one problem I have with the game it's that some of the map designs come off as very lazy, but you'll largely forget about that when constructing a maze. I haven't played much multiplayer or survival mode myself, but in later waves of longer games, guns can also come to be seemingly ineffectual, as damage doesn't scale at all with the growing power of enemies. Sanctum does what it does near perfectly and there are very few changes I would consider making to improve it.			",224,59,3,36,12,0,29

												It was the first time I played a ""Hybrid"" FPS/TD game and I have to say that I loved it.+ Very decent graphics.+ Every Turret and Weapon has upgrades.+ You can build mazes to make the enemy take longer routes.+ Full of ""SECRETS"" to discover (sometimes more than one per map).+ All enemy have a ""weakspot"" ( this makes some turrets stronger for each kind of monster, also makes you aim at specific parts of the monsters).+ Very challenging. Try the insane dificulty :O- Sometimes it gets boring when maps take +45minutes to beat all waves or you have a nice Turret and maze combination built to do most of your work.- Multiplayer has almost no players. (Never seen more than 7 players online).- There is a buggy achievement. (Takes forever to get it, even though it's one of the easiest)- You will probably need some guides to find all the secrets because they are extremely hard to find on your own. ( I used guides for most of them :$).It gave me some good hours of fun and I can't wait to start playing Sanctum 2.Remember this is just my opinion, some of my (+) can be a (-) to you and viceversa. It depends from player to player.Also I'm sorry for my English. (I'm Portuguese).Hope my review was helpful to you! :D			",10,1,0,3,1,0,2

												Sanctum is a Tower Defense game which allows for a first person shooter perspective. Released in 2011, graphically it doesn't look bad at all. The object of the game is to lay blocks and outfit them with varying weaponry to direct the path of your enemy waves, lay down suppressive fire and take out as many enemies as possible, and have a varied amount of weapons as each wave has different enemies who have resistences to certain types of damage. Once you have done this, you go into initiate a wave, use your own personal first person shooter weapons and assist the towers with defeating waves before they reach your core. At the end of each wave you are given a number of resources which can be spent on upgrades both to the towers as well as your personal weapons. I've played several tower defense games, but this one let's you get down in there and add a personal touch to defense, by combining the FPS experience with more traditional tower defense features. While I enjoyed Sanctum, I look forward to seeing what happens next in the series and how they upgrade our experience to another level. Sanctum features single player mode, a variety of different levels each with their own geography and challenges, as well as multiplayer mode. I recommend going through the tutorial phase, so you really get an understanding of what the weapons and enemies are capable of before diving right into the main game.			",479,176,24,74,66,6,86

												Although I am writing this having played the sequel, Sanctum 2, I'm still going to recommend it. In fact, I'm recommending you to get both Sanctum and Sanctum 2. Get this: Sanctum and Sanctum 2, although not entirely different games, play different altogether. Read my review on Sanctum 2 for additional details.Simply put, Sanctum puts more emphasis on maze and tower building, and has slightly less player interaction (e.g. you cannot change towers' targeting behavior) compared to Sanctum 2. I would say Sanctum is 90% tower defense and 10% hero defense, although based on many other players' calculations, and also depending on which stage you're playing, it could be classified as 75% tower defense and 25% hero defense. The hero defense number can be further increased if players themselves choose to actively participate in fights against enemies. In short, however, it is safe to say that there are more times in Sanctum when you can just leave your towers alone to do the defense than in Sanctum 2.Gameplay aside, Sanctum is easily way ahead of its time for a game that was released in 2011. The graphics are impressive, and the developers spot-on exploited their advantage by designing an original world that is both beautiful and immersive. With its original characters and concepts, Sanctum deserves a whole lot more love than it currently does and that is doing it no justice.Sanctum is a jewel of a game, a world record that has only been beaten by its sequel, which sadly had been born and crafted at the wrong time: Valve's own Portal 2 was released merely days later and everybody boarded the hype train for the more famous franchise. Sanctum, having barely wrestled gamers' attention from bigger titles such as Crysis 2, Dragon Age 2 and the PC release of Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood earlier that year, took a hit to its sales that persisted throughout 2011's Steam Summer Sale. Later that year, releases of games such as Dead Island, Dungeon Siege 3 and The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings kept Sanctum from floating above the surface, while it struggled to race for sales before FPS competitors Battlefield 3 and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 joined in for their share. However, it was when The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim was released in November that Sanctum drowned among the hype.But is Sanctum dead? No, far from it. Like a ship filled with treasures, it had just sunk to the ocean floor, waiting for ambitious adventurers to come and retrieve it, and those who are looking for glorious gold would do well to pick it up. And good treasures should always be shared, and spent together. You can spread the word about the treasures to people you know, or pick up additional treasures to be given to them. Either way is a bargain for you as long as you are in possession of such a valuable artifact.The paragon of Sanctum is the soundtrack. Perfectly composed to perfectly match the environment and mood, not many music composition can reach out to player's emotions as effectively as Sanctum. When you're done listening to the main menu theme on repeated loops while you sleep, play it one more time while you read the 2 or 3 paragraphs above. Leave a comment if you shed a tear or 2.This game is easily, a10 out of 10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played Sanctum2 first and came to Sanctum backwards.  I have to say, I really like the game play of one better than 2.  The ability to upgrade personal weapons, the fact that towers also block the play field of view, and the televators is something I would have liked to see in 2.  The one thing that I don't like about Sanctum is that you don't get the achievements for playing multiplayer.  Personally, I enjoy these games more in multiplayer than in solo play.

Story/Presentation: 8Not much to say about this game's story, really. It's really just about a girl who defends a major core built from her allies from aliens invading. It's basic, but what I gotta give an above average score is it's presentation. First, the aliens. They look so cool! They're all very distinctive and unique in their own design and traits, and works perfectly with the game's tone. The soundtrack of the game's Really lovely and engaging as well. I loved and was happy buying it's soundtrack after trying out the game. Gameplay: 10This is the highlight of the game and what makes it SO good~! The game is one of the world's first First Person Shooter Tower of Defence. The design behind it and the strategy one has to make is perfect. The majority of the weapons are awesome, and it all plays good roles to strategize on how to defeat the aliens from reaching the core. Keep in mind that the game's Very hard, and takes a lot of practice to get it going, but still worth it. I feel like the combat was very balanced. With the constant reloads your own weapon has, it gives good opportunity for your towers to fight and cover for you.Overall: 9It's very obvious this game can't be for everyone, but it's still incredibly addicting. I am extremely happy I gave this game a try. It's super memorable, it's tons of fun, very challenging, and provides great replay value. It's a shame it's not that well played much since the release of it's sequel title, for I'd love to try out the Co-Op version of this at some point, but doesn't stop me from trying the game again in single player and play it more often. I would HIGHLY recommend this game for anybody.			",177,21,4,12,6,2,15

												Short Version:Like TDs? Definitely give this one a spin unless you heavily dislike FSPs.Long Version:Gameplay - The hybrid tower/FPS feels very good as you can single handedly wipe the some mobs yourself, let the towers do it for yourself or fine tune your defence in order to covers each's sides flaws or create true deathzones. There's a very decent number of maps with varied layouts and the possibilty to maze in your own style. Your typical towers/weapons are here with a few more original concepts in between. The difficulty feels fair, it takes good tower strategy and shooting in order to clear the more difficult maps. Multiplayer is there too and I had great fun playing with some friends, too bad they can't help you tackle the Insane difficulty ones so I could get those achievements T_T.Story - Not much of it at first glance, there's material outside the game and some secrets to be found in some maps but overall it's not the selling point. It would eventually get greatly expanded in Sanctum 2 but I'll comment on that on it's review.Sound - I surprinsingly love this game's tunes, I often listen to game ST's outside and people give me the looks but, listen to Sanctum's, and they praise it, they can't believe it's from a game, it's a different style. (Which I would love more of, if anyone know' more stuff like this PM me or something, I couldn't find more work by the same guy).Graphics - The looks fit the futuristic style and everything is clean and slick. I personally tone some of it down because all the bloom and stuff makes the game so bright and vividly coloured it hurts my eyes but that's my preference.			",42,16,0,34,2,0,7

												If you like good strategy, intense challenge and epic music, this game might fit all your needs.This game is a masterpiece in hybrid TD/FPS games, because it promotes the tower defense gameplay as priority over FPS gameplay. For which, in comparison to the 2nd game in the series, this one does a really good job at it with little things such as randomized enemies in survival mode, the ability to upgrade weapons and no overcharging towers.All in all,  i'd recommend getting both the original Sanctum and Sanctum 2, since both have completely different gameplay priorities over the other.

												The best tower defense game I've ever played, period – and I've played well over a dozen. Seamless integration of FPS gameplay with impeccable TD mechanics. Tons of ways to create mazes, many effective tower/weapon combinations, great mix of satisfying combat and strategic planning. Unique enemies, beautiful art style and AN ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC SOUNDTRACK!			",166,79,0,31,4,2,25

												A great TD game - better than Sanctum 2. It's cheap, runs well, looks pretty. FPS play works very well in the game to keep the action going.It's also very cool to play with other people, I've gone hours on survival mode with my friends.The game has a lot of content going for it already, but then there's also the free DLCs and the really cheap ones (they go down to $0.99 on sale).I find the game is better than Sanctum 2 - the game just feels better. It really has polish, and I felt Sanctum 2 kind of lacked that; as a result, it's a funner game. You don't have to level up for perks, (the grind is removed entirely) and there isn't pressure to be constantly firing at all times.I also see much better FPS in this game than in Sanctum 2, even when I turn down the graphics to low. The game ends up looking worse than Sanctum 1 but still doesn't run as well.There are a lot of really cool towers in this game too, and the lack of a wall limit (which was an odd decision for Sanctum 2 that further distanced it from a TD game) lets you be much more inventive with the game.Past that, Sanctum is really a good game. For fans of TD, FPS, and messing around with their friends, Sanctum is a game for you.			",873,187,30,71,75,9,113

												This game has a ton of updates and new free stuff added every couple months. It also has AAA graphics and co-op or single-user game play for the price of an indie puzzle game -- on sale. Lots of replayability on the few maps it comes with, and (though somewhat controversial) the new maps and weapons released as DLC are a lot of fresh fun that I feel are worth the cost. The DLC weapons can be used by you in games that your friends may not have them, which helps keep your load outs unique to eachother, and they're cheap if you ever want to add on. Those complaining of this model are forgetting how much replayable game you are already getting for the base price of 9.99. The extra stuff is just sprinkles and doughnuts. Play it with your friends or alone, it's a great mesh of tower defense and varied, upgradable gunplay. Simply stunning game.			",904,197,17,59,57,3,87

												Sanctum is a fun and challenging game. It requires you to balance resources and defense structures. The goal of each map is to defend a core from incoming waves of monsters. Simple right? It's not. Each wave is unique in that the content varies. Some waves may only contain one monster, while another wave can contain many types. Each monster has a specific weak spot that you target to kill them more effectively. You have to destoy these waves by constructing an efficient maze of towers and guns. But you don't have unlimited resources; only what is given to you after each wave. That's when creativity and balancing come into play.The game is even more fun under mulitplayer mode. With more people, you have more resources to spend to defend your core. However, the monster waves are random and stronger than the single player version. Communication is key to having a sucessful game. A method that can be used have each person focus on a type of tower (one person can focus on anti-air and floors, while another one could focus on ground and laser towers)This game was worth the purchase. It provides you with a great challenge. Be warned though because each round can take up to an hour or more. If you have plenty of time to kill and want a challenge, then this game is for you. But if you don't have the time or patience to play, skip this game. There will be times where after playing for 45 minutest to an hour, you find out that your core has been attacked and you no longer have that 100%. You quit and then you resume from last save. So have paitence when playing this game. One last note: Play around with the multiplayer chat. You'll be laughing a lot.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love this game. I have always loved this game. Something about FPS meets tower defence game that just speaks to me. Not only that - the way that it beutifully satisfies the different types of players in Co-op means (outside of Portal 2), its the game you have to have as a co-op. I would like to see some more maps, but with Sanctum 2 here - Im thinking this is not something I am ever likely to see. But, counterbalance this with what is now a very reasonable price, and you've got yourself a highly enjoyable game thats worth the spend when your looking to share your evenings with that special IP address.

												Sanctum is a strange beast. It seems designed from the ground up for multiplayer. There's no plot or characters. Yet the multiplayer is all but abandoned. Though, in the past few weeks, I keep finding myself grinding waves on the single-player. It's fun. Stupid fun. It takes strategy. Planning. After that's all done, you get some real twitch-shooter fun. I was dissapointed that there wasn't any real content or story, but the mechanics are just great enough to keep me comming back for wave after wave. Sanctum will make you think, but not too hard. 7/10			",121,38,1,6,10,0,6

												I can recommend this game, but just barely. If you have time to play either Sanctum or Sanctum 2, please opt for the second in the series. The real issue with the original Sanctum, in my view, is just that there are just too many variables.  Sanctum is the free jazz of FPS tower defense, for my music fans out there. In the second game, your weapon stays the same, you can drop around 15 towers per map, and each tower can be upgraded 3 times. In Sanctum, you can upgrade your weapon up to 5 times, you can upgrade towers up to 5 times, and you can drop as many towers as you can afford. Secondly, the waves you fight each time you play a map are random. This led both me and my partner to fail maps repeatedly without really getting a feel for what our issues were. We completed all main game and DLC maps on normal, but had an extremely difficult time with a few on hard. An important aspect of any game is the sense of feedback the player is given. I feel that almost all of the changes made in the second game were positive. However, FPS tower defense is a unique and awesome genre, and the importance placed both on towers and the player's ability to place shots makes this series more engaging than typical tower defense.

												I enjoyed this one quite a bit.  Many if not most games I've played that try to mix tower defense with a controllable character fall flat because the balance doesn't work.  In this one, though, you can't only focus on one aspect.  If you just level up your weapons a ton, you'll run up against cooldowns and ammo restrictions and never be able to gun down all the enemies yourself.  If you only build towers and try to take a smoke break during the level, you'll be overrun during waves that have skill-dependent enemies.  The inclusion of enemies with a weak point that the player can aim for, but the towers won't, is an inspired choice.  It forces you to build and act in concert with your defenses.  Tough enemies can be slowed down, things that are only vulnerable in a single spot can be sniped, and swarms can be intelligently targeted with AOE attacks.  The sole drawback is that you can only hold 3 guns, and the sniper rifle and cold gun seem, to me, indispensable.  The other complaint I can make is that the 3-D nature of the game isn't fully supported/exploited.  So, unlike most TD games, a tower can't just shoot anything in its 'range'.  It has to have line-of-sight (in most cases).  This is good, as it forces you to think about where to put your blocks, which ones to make shot-transparent, and what obstacles in the level will affect your fields of fire. It's bad, though, because the game will show you a circle on the overhead view that denotes the tower's max range, but nothing else.  If you want to learn what it can actually see, the only solutions are to put your character's perspective as close as you can to the tower's (usually impossible, since you can't stand inside it, and the towers are mostly a lot taller than your PC) or observe what it shoots at during the levels (which requires you to look carefully at the overview while the action's going on, and not participate in the defense).  A feature that gave you the POV of the tower would make this so much easier.Of note, this recommendation includes the free add-ons unlocking new towers and weapons, as well as the paid-for DLC granting new maps.  This adds much-needed variety, and I would probably be less enthusiastic if I'd played it at release.			",42,8,0,5,6,0,11

												Sanctum is a welcome twist on the Tower Defense (""TD"") genre. In Sanctum, you roam the map, FPS-style, adding your own firepower against the invaders. You can choose to upgrade your personal firepower in the same way you upgrade your towers. The most useful mindset is to think of yourself as a mobile tower that augments your fixed towers. Along with the usual kill pits you build in TD games, you'll find yourself creating several kill corridors -- straight walkways that you can pearch at the end of and get maximum use out of your personal weaponry.At release there are are only 3 maps, but more are promised. 4-6 hours of entertainment, playing once through. More maps will help this game.You can play mutliplayer, too.I give Sanctum a recommendation to fans of TD. Others should probably start with a more traditional TD game like Defense Grid, which offers more maps, more polish, and a better all-around value. Still, Sanctum is worth a look. Watch for the promised extra content.			",168,52,2,18,21,2,22

												In short, it's a very good, highly flexible game marred only slightly by an occasionally inconsistent difficulty curve -- and for some people, the lack of narrative progression might put them off progressing through the single-player campaign. Despite these minor issues, however, Sanctum remains a high quality game which the developer remains committed to -- and at the price, it's a complete bargain.It's an innovative and enjoyable experience and one that I lost myself in as time flew by.

												This game is great for two player co-op.  It's more strategic and less furious action than team shooter games, so, I find, it is good for couples co-op play (husband and wife, or boyfriend and girlfriend).  The game has action, with your character shooting down the incoming aliens, and also strategy, with your team building a maze of defensive towers and choosing which kind of towers.  The goal of the game is stop the aliens from destroying your core (home base building).  I find this can be a more satisfying, constructive goal than a goal of simply killing aliens (or killing other players).  The game is nicely implemented and fun to play, as is its sequel.

												Sanctum is a strategy/FPS hybrid game with tower defense tied in, complimented by its exciting and catchy sci-fi soundtrack and awesome environments. In Sanctum, you play as a soldier known as Autumn Skye, and you must defend The Core, the power source for all of your towers and for your entire base. Aliens of different forms will come and attempt to attack it, and attack you and your friends. Each enemy has different strategies of attacking, and each one has different weak-spots, where hits will do more damage than the hits would on the other parts of their bodies. Some of these enemies are airborne, and will attack from above, and some will attack ground-level.There are 16 maps in the base-game Sanctum, and each have different amounts of space for your tower bases. You can arrange them however you like, and you and your friends must build a maze to make it so that the aliens, known as the Lumes, will have the hardest time possible attempting their reach to your Core. You must use your resources to build new towers, upgrade old towers, and upgrade your weapons.Sanctum is a fun game to play with friends, or in single-player alike, and the variation to the enemies, weapons, and towers is pretty cool. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys strategy games, FPS games, and tower defense games, as well as those who like sci-fi themes. ^.^			",128,25,6,31,15,0,22

But that's not good enough you need to master that map... So you will play it again, on hard this time. You'll do alright, but doing alright isn't good enough, so you will play it again and again and again untill you ace it on hard, and you will.... But that's not good enough... so you set it to hard on survival mode, and you make it to level 30, that's pretty good....

												This isn't a bad game. Theoretically Sanctum does everything the way it should be and theoretically this mix of FPS shooter and Tower Defense should work well. Although it doesn't. At least not for me. All the pros that has been mentioned in other reviews don't mean much due to one factor, that ruins all the fun: The missions are way too long with too many waves, combined with a very user-UNfriendly save system. Long story short: i don't have neither the nerves nor the time to spend TWO HOURS to kill all 30 waves on one map, very often even without a chance to correct my mistakes.			",103,12,1,31,1,1,26

												Let me start by saying that I do not recommend this game at its full price. I paid .99 USD for it so for that price you cant really go too wrong. I enjoyed the game at first, its uniqu(ish) blend of FPS and TD was amusing, but I soon started to see that the game was lacking in some areas. I played with a friend as well to see what how he felt about and found us agreeing in most areas. My biggest griped was polish. The game seems like it coulda used a decent amount it. I noticed animations gliching out a bunch of times, turrets having fits when enemies quickly moved in and out of range, the player often getting stuck and needing to teleport out (seems like a copout from a dev standpoint). My friends biggest gripe was odd balancing. We often found that the first 4-6 waves of enemies we could stop before they barely made any progress out of the starting point, then the next wave would break right through to the end and we'd loose. Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, insanely hard. Not a fun difficutly curve. Also, while the fps portions of the game all worked nicely and looked good, the TD portions seemed ad hoc assembly of tower defense features that didnt fit together to well anf felt clunky. Like the game was designed as a FPS defense kinda thing, then someone added in the the tower stuff where ever it would fit. That being said if you love FPSs and are so so about TDs, then this might just be for you! But if you love TDs and could take or leave a FPS, then this isnt going to mesh well. Its not a bad game, and Im sure there are lots of people who love it. But, it wanst my cup of tea. To me it felt like 2/10 TD and 8/10 FPS, where a smash hit in my eyes would have those numbers transposed. Over all i would give it a 6 out of 10. Not bad, but not good enough to keep me coming back for more.			",111,16,0,29,46,2,61

												This is a wonderful Tower Defense Game that I encourage you to play. I've only played for a couple of hours on this game in two player co-op (it supports up to four players, which I can only imagine would be insanely fun), and it has been amazing. There is a good variety of enemies, towers, maps, and weapons which allow for a great deal of unique play time. Each wave in the game is randomly generated from the enemy pool that is available. I could imagine that it wouldn't be as much fun in single player as it is in co-op, but if you have anyone in mind that you think you could have fun with in a co-op Tower Defense Game, then pick this up -- you'll be damn glad you did!

												Just, wow. Coffee Stain Studios has created an amazing game by combining the popular First Person Shooter style with Tower Defence, as I'm sure you are aware. With an all-female cast this ought to please those without girlfriends, or girls who think that games need more girls. Anyway, there are plenty of easter eggs hidden around the place, sure you may think that the game is just about placing towers and shooting aliens, but hidden in the easter eggs is a very rich story, as is brought forward in Sanctum 2. I would personally have loved this as an open-world game. Amazing game for people who like Tower Defence or First Person Shooters, or maybe a bit of both!			",62,6,2,6,8,0,4

												A unique blend of FPS and TD that works quite well. However your weapons are purely complementary meaning you can't just tank the entire level by yourself. While they are still useful, they are somewhat of a novelty item. That isn't necessarily a bad thing though.Like most tower defenses, there is some 2 lined story somewhere but nothing to get excited about.I don't play many TD games but I find this one charming and quite likable.The gameplay is simplistic and easy, standard TD rules apply. Build and maze, install turrets, upgrade turrets, don't let them get all the way. Of course you can assist them greatly with your own weapons, complementary but ultimately effective.The enemies are the norm with few variations; fast but no armour, slow but heavily protected etc. There is one unit whose shield will only go down from a headshot and one who is so tough they require constant attention from your assault rifle.Graphics are cartoonish and light. The sountrack is half decent. My relatively high end laptop handles this game without any problems. Recommended for pretty much anyone who has a modicum of interest in TD games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I had played Sanctum for less than 30 minutes before I was telling my friends of Steam that this game is awesome, and should buy it. It’s a tower defence game, but then becomes an FPS when the round starts, and you go shooting up the baddies along side your turrets. It also has co-op, and is even more fun when playing with your friends. The art also reminds me of borderlands some. I recommend this game.			",164,26,0,32,14,0,13

												Got a coupon by crafting a badge, so I thought: Why not? After some time playing I have to say it's a really great game. Combining TD and FPS is what makes this game so enjoyable. In the setup phase you have time to build walls and towers, as well as upgrade them (and your own weapons). Once you hit enter, the wave starts and you don't have to watch your towers doing the work - you jump into the action yourself. The towers might be powerful but there's certain things they can't do which you can. Aiming for enemies weakness spots for instance. Overall a really enjoyable game.			",58,7,0,8,4,1,3

												Hmm, no ""maybe"" choice for recommending, so I guess it gets a Yes since I'm a mostly positive guy.Sanctum is fun for a while, but it doesn't hold up after several hours of play.  The levels seem dragged out way longer than necessary to compensate for a lack of content.The shooting part is mixed as well.  There's some good weapon variety suited for specific enemy types, and juggling weapons as they cool down keeps me engaged.  Unfortunately, mowing down rows of enemies that don't do anything but follow a path is not all that exciting, even with a few that do a small amount of dodging.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sanctum is the mix of an FPS, and Tower Defense game. It sports online co-op, good looking graphics, and lots of DLC to sift through and throw money at the developers for. For the longest time, this game was overpriced. It has finally come down to 10$ (5$ on sale) that seems a bit more reflective of the content recieved.  The online co-op definately has some problems, however the game is brought together by the soundtrack, graphics, and cool dlc towers.  If you are a huge tower defense fan then this game is worth it. If you are a huge FPS fan that doesn't care much about tower defense, you will hate this game. Let me make this clear:  DUNGEON DEFENDERS IS SUPPERIOR IN EVERY WAY!I got this game after Dungeon Defenders, so I didn't get to enjoy it much before DD spoiled me. DD is only 15$ (less on sale) and is MUCH more worth it for fun tower defense co-op gameplay. GET DUNGEON DEFENDERS. Then if you still want more, get Sanctum. ~PR0XIDIAN			",913,138,59,85,56,7,110

												Picked this game up on a recommendation from EnPfhy.  This is a TON of fun.  It combines all the aspects of a great tower defence game with the ability to be on the ground fighting and shooting along with your towers.  You can upgrade both your towers and your personal weapons, and there is co-op play for up to four people.  There are so many ways to approach any map, and the attacking armies are randomized so that every playthrough is different.  The DLC is not necessary (although the violator is a very useful tower to own), and the price is great for the amount of gameplay that you get.  Highly recommended.			",376,71,8,65,59,0,103

Allerdings ist es Schade, dass es nur so wenig verschiedene Gegnertypen gibt und sich diese auf jeder Karte wiederholen. Ein wenig mehr Abwechslung hätte dem Spiel sicherlich gut getan. Aber es macht Spaß und ist auch fordernd und dennoch immer machbar. Alles in allem also durchaus weiter zu empfehlen.			",81,33,3,22,16,1,34

												this game is pretty fun.  tower defence / first person shooter.  kill alians. This game offers a fantastic combination of Tower Defense and First Person Shooter elements.  Blast through waves of alians in a variety of locations.  Each map offers multiple strategies and with the selection of towers, each match can be a completely new experience.  While tower placement and maze design are significant, the player and their weapons stand to make a difference with proper timing and resource management.  The towers and weapons can be used in conjunction for devastating attacks.The user interface and combat style are well designed and easy to understand.  The graphics are outstanding.  The world design and weapon models are unique, yet recognizable.  Each tower and weapon has noticeable visual upgrades as they progress in level.  This game is enjoyable in one-player mode.  In my opinion the pinnacle of what this game has to offer can be found in the online multiplayer.  2-4 players build and work together to protect their core.  There exists a collective sense of teamwork, but also a spirit of competition to see who can kill the most aliens.  Altogether, this game offers both an in-depth Tower Defense motif structured around a solid First Person shooter, the combination of which is unparalleled on the available gaming market.

												Good fun game, and works well as a co-op multiplayer title too. Place your defensive towers, and when the enemy streams in the game places you right there in the field with your weapons at the ready so you can join in the destructive mayhem.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Have friends who enjoy teamwork? Then look at this game. You will have a good laugh playing this together as you need to plan ahead in each level how to beat the waves of enemies attacking. Plan the route, plan towers and uppgrades etc.Gfx, Gameplay, Sfx and music is great. I must say that the soundtrack is spot on to the atmosphere. The game is easy to understand but hard to master.Level upp your characters and there abillities, perks and weapons. Unlock more advanced towers. Most of all, have fun... ;)This is the first of the series of Sanctum. And i can promise that you will enjoy this if you enjoyed Sanctum 2.			",583,134,18,134,88,7,141

												when i first saw sanctum title i thought it was a HUGE mistake (that i bought the game) the fact that this is a indie and strategy game make's most of the people's ""afraid"" from the game but as a person that preety much hate's startegy games i can say clearly that is one of the best games i ever playd it applays a veriaty of enemies and tactics combined together. its not too complicated and you'll preety mcuh going to find yourself sitting on your chair for hours while playing this game the grpahics is great for indie and even for a video game alone.there's no story and its kind of annoying plus the fact that the game sometimes isn't really serious for example when you win you see your soldier's dancing to pop music and if you loose you see your enemies dancing wich is probebly the most idiotic thing in the world,  it makes the enemies less scary and threatning BUT its not that bad.the art design and thinking on the little things is what makes the game so uniqe the enemies are amazing they arn't exactly soldier's nether monster's not even elians it makes the game more intresting when you need to understand what is the Purpose uniqe abilities and weak point of each enemy . and you have all the info so its really making the game more chellenging nether intresting i really recomend people that want to have fun but not work too hard if you looking to spent your time on a really fun and enjoyble game (that isn't make you feel stupid) that is the game for you and you can buy it only for 10$ and 2.5$ if there's a sale +the game has amazing enemies+alot of tactics and smart AI+really good startegy game+good graphics-not so serious-no campaign or story8/10 really good  ",238,39,1,27,14,2,19

You like running-and-gunning? Well you can! Just upgrade your weapons more than your towers and blast away! ORYou like strategic placements of towers so that they can lay a rain of pain as efficiently as possible? You can! Just build more towers and upgrade as much as your ""money"" or ""Resource"". 9/10 for trying out this completely new idea and actually making it work.			",232,52,4,12,19,2,23

												Picked this game up on a recommendation from EnPfhy.  This is a TON of fun.  It combines all the aspects of a great tower defence game with the ability to be on the ground fighting and shooting along with your towers.  You can upgrade both your towers and your personal weapons, and there is co-op play for up to four people.  There are so many ways to approach any map, and the attacking armies are randomized so that every playthrough is different.  The DLC is not necessary (although the violator is a very useful tower to own), and the price is great for the amount of gameplay that you get.  Highly recommended.			",376,71,8,65,59,0,103

It has attention to detail in the enviroments and has secrets inside them to be found. It encourages you to get in the action and defend instead of letting the towers do all the work. It also features an addictive soundtrack! Highly recommended! ^_^			",380,55,9,31,35,2,38

												*INITIAL IMPRESSIONS*Of course I start getting into it now that the sequel dwells on the horizon. FML.Pretty much Sanctum is a tower defense game, you fight off a wave then you're given time to build up defences and upgrade your towers and weapons in anticipation of what the next wave will contain. Almost exactly what you would expect from tower defense. Not to say that Sanctum is bland though, personally I like it a helluva lot more than the other TD game I've played, the kills felt rewarding, the challenge curve is rock steady and the game has changeable loadouts for weapons and towers to increase variety and to make room for countless strategies and combinations of defenses. In short, it's a solid, well built game that is easy to pick up on and enjoyable.			",143,30,0,14,4,2,3

												Sanctum is the mix of an FPS, and Tower Defense game. It sports online co-op, good looking graphics, and lots of DLC to sift through and throw money at the developers for. For the longest time, this game was overpriced. It has finally come down to 10$ (5$ on sale) that seems a bit more reflective of the content recieved.  The online co-op definately has some problems, however the game is brought together by the soundtrack, graphics, and cool dlc towers.  If you are a huge tower defense fan then this game is worth it. If you are a huge FPS fan that doesn't care much about tower defense, you will hate this game. Let me make this clear:  DUNGEON DEFENDERS IS SUPPERIOR IN EVERY WAY!I got this game after Dungeon Defenders, so I didn't get to enjoy it much before DD spoiled me. DD is only 15$ (less on sale) and is MUCH more worth it for fun tower defense co-op gameplay. GET DUNGEON DEFENDERS. Then if you still want more, get Sanctum. ~PR0XIDIAN			",913,138,59,85,56,7,110

												A brilliant mix of well-executed tower defense and intense, tactical first person shooting, this game has been my greatest pleasant surprise of 2011. Play consists of building phases (where you construct your maze and populate it with a variety of weapons) and action phases (where the aliens come, your towers to their work, and you clean up/cover your♥♥♥♥♥fall off the side of the map uselessly). It's well paced, strategically substantial during the build phases, and absolutely frenetic during the action phases. For its asking price, I can't recommend this thing highly enough. The DLC is generally well done as well, and helps support a tiny developer with enormous potential.			",234,75,15,58,62,3,100

												Keeps the good parts of tower defence: a range of mobs, towers, and debuffs that invite tactical consideration, and the oft-missed maze-building on most maps; but then adds to that a surprisingly fluid rocket-jumping FPS to let you pick off or crack the shield of troublemakers while the towers do their thing. The Violator DLC is lovely, the mazebuilding maps are good, but the others are mostly forgettable and it cries out for third-party map support (or just more maps) rather than the sequel it's getting.

												Sanctum does an excellent job of balancing fast-paced FPS action with building strategic tower defense. If you have played dungeon defenders it is somewhat similar although Sanctum is first-person and has no character classes. However, you do get several weapons to choose from before each map and you can generally bring about 3 along with you. Even better, you get to choose about 5-8 types of towers to take along as well and so there is a lot of flexibility in how you want to set up your defenses. Plus if you have a friend who will play then that's more hours of fun right there.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'll make this short, It's a great...no FANTASTIC game if you enjoy strategy/tower defence games. Sanctum's controls and mechanics are easy to pick up. The enemys in Sanctum quickly get difficult but this poses a challenge that fun to work against with friends. I would not purchase this game if you intend to play it alone, It is very difficult to play alone and gets old quite fast...BUT playing it with friends is incredibly fun. Keep in mind that the more people you play with the harder the waves of enemies get sooner on in the game. I find playing with two people is the best because you can work together easier and the enemy do not get too difficult too soon. This is a easy 12/10.If you are chosing between Sanctum 1 or Sanctum 2, I would chose the first. I find Sanctum 2's gameplay not as enjoyable and does not flow the same way the first one does.

Be prepared to feel your own way around the game, you get a basic tutorial and that's it, no story, no explanation of all the guns or turrets, nothing. The graphics are easy on the eyes and the mechanics feel very sturdy, not buggy at all, this was a very clean, polished game. It might be hit and miss for some people, but if you can wrap your head around tower defence in 3D, I think you'll enjoy it. Also try Orcs Must Die!			",203,47,4,22,12,2,14

Turrets are a bit disappointing would of liked something a little more cool, No storyline just gameplay which is okay. Im glad i got the DLC in the same bundle i bought this game on as the base game did not seem to offer very much gameplay espically for its current price. But overall a solid tower defense game.

												Sanctum artfully blends strategy and FPS to create an interesting take on the tower defense experience. The game mechanics are surprisingly well-thought out, suited to provide challenges to the experts and novices of both of these genres. The multiplayer is tons of fun, the graphics allow for smooth visuals without sacrificing smooth performance, and best of all, it doesn't come with a ridiculous $60 price tag. Honestly, the only problem I found with this game is the lack of built-in voice chat capability, and I'm sure if people make enough of a stink about it, they might convince the developer to add that in the next update.I'd definitely give this one a shot, especially if you've got people to play co-op with or are just looking for some fresh, captivating entertainment.

												Sanctum is a hybrid FPS tower defence game. Build and upgrade your towers between waves, and then assist your towers with killing the invaders before they destroy your base power core. The combat feels like a fast paced old school FPS. The two elements fit together nicely, for example some enemies take reduced damage from  towers until the player shoots their weak spot. And of course each different tower is better suited to killing different types of enemies. The environment can be a hazard to the player - fall off a ledge and enemies will push forward until you recover. This all allows for some varied and deep tactics. The number of maps, difficulty levels and achievements provides for many hours of replayability. The graphics and sound quality is good for an indie release, and the game is also very stable and bug free. The only major flaw is the lack of any kind of story to tie the levels together. But Sanctum is still great value for money, even at full price.			",145,31,0,15,8,2,16

												Have friends who enjoy teamwork? Then look at this game. You will have a good laugh playing this together as you need to plan ahead in each level how to beat the waves of enemies attacking. Plan the route, plan towers and uppgrades etc.Gfx, Gameplay, Sfx and music is great. I must say that the soundtrack is spot on to the atmosphere. The game is easy to understand but hard to master.Level upp your characters and there abillities, perks and weapons. Unlock more advanced towers. Most of all, have fun... ;)This is the first of the series of Sanctum. And i can promise that you will enjoy this if you enjoyed Sanctum 2.			",583,134,18,134,88,7,141

												Despite the fact that it has weapons pack DLC and map pack DLC (both of which are paid) it is a surprisingly fun game.  The weapon DLC is not pay-to-win (thankfully) but instead just gives you more flexibility for playstyle.  It's a tower-defense game, you can place blocks to adjust enemy movement, put towers on them, said towers can be upgraded.Fairly simple style, and very fun.  I played for 100 minutes my first playthrough, and that was only 2 levels!  There's no character customization (unfortunately) so you're stuck as the red-head you see in the banner.  You unlock more towers as you play through (maybe more weapons, I hadn't found more yet) which gives you more variety, and the enemies are VERY varied and specialist.  One will run incredibly fast if given a straight sprint, but slows to a crawl around corners.  Another can only be damaged by shooting it in the back of the head.7/10 And thanks to my friend Erythrocytes for gifting me this.			",222,15,2,16,17,2,17

												Lets begin by saying this game is a great concept and reminds me of some custom maps in Starcraft 2 for tower defense. The difference here is the game is extremely polished, and plays relatively straight forward, I can't really elaborate since it simply provides tower defense (contruction) with hero combat (FPS). The only real flaw I can find in this game for what it is, is the forced heavy use of the FPS component (upgrading assault is pretty much necessary, and takes priority over such things as mazing, investing in tower combos). Great game and great price too, a definite recommendation.			",631,155,16,70,57,4,101

												Adds a flare to the tower defense genre by introducing first person game mechanics.  These include first person placement and upgrading of towers and first person shooting.

Tower foundations can be fitted with teleporters allowing quick access to different parts of the map.  Well thoughtout and executed.  Only 4 maps at present but multiple difficulties.

												Sanctum is a combination of first person shooter and tower defense. There are 5 or 6 main levels, each consisting of a whole bunch of ""waves"". In between each wave, you use resources to build various types of turrets/defenses and/or upgrade your weapons. Once a wave starts, between you and your defenses, you just have to lay the smackdown on a bunch of advancing aliens. Rinse and repeat. Overall, it's a pretty fun game. However, the between-wave building parts kind of brought the game down for me due to the need to build all your defenses in first person. It's very tedious and time-consuming (and also confusing at times, especially on larger maps). The game would be so much better if the building could be done via a top down ""god view"". But other than that, no major complaints. Apparently it is more fun in multiplayer, but I never ended up checking that out. Overall, I'd say this is worth a look if you like shooters and tower defense, and can pick it up on sale. ",828,379,20,113,78,6,151

												A newer revolutionary take on tower defense, Sanctum completely immerses the player within its highly constructible and ever changing war-like world (which you help create essentially). FPS meets an otherwise typical third person strategy genre, bringing with it some challenging, clever, and overall phenomenal gameplay. A sharp, adaptable mind along with a quick trigger finger and a bit of cunning allows any experienced gamer to excel here.As of yet, there have not been many on the co-op aspect. However, my praises and strong recommendation for this game comes from just the single-player mode alone if that's any consolation; it's definitely worth trying out to say the least, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I already have thus far.

												Sanctum is an interesting game to talk about. A lot of times when you ask someone if they like tower defense style games, you generally always get an answer to where they find it either good or just boring. On the other hand, asking if someone likes first person shooters, a lot of people will normally say yes depending on which part of the genre you're talking about. Sanctum is a different beast, it combines best of both worlds to make for an interesting concept. Being one or few of the only games that utilizes a hybrid tower defense/first person shooter approach, it excutes the idea in a very balanced fashion. Albeit, the amount of levels without dlc is rather short, with it, there is enough variety both gameplay wise and level wise there to give you several hours of gameplay alone or with your friends. Did I mention you can play with your friends? Thought I didn't.Overall, good game, good idea, just a little short, but still worthy of playing if you like to have something to play for a few hours, not including the well hidden secrets that can keep you going a little while longer.I suggest buying this during a sale if possible however, as you'll want the dlcs that comes with this. Except for Yogscave, we don't talk about Yogscave.7/10			",68,6,0,5,16,0,25

												Before I picked up first Sanctum game I already played Sanctum 2. Why? To be honest, I didn't expected much for this kind mix of genres and since I got it from some bundle I didn't really care about previous game. I enjoyed Sanctum 2 so I decided to get first one on next sale. I don't regret it. People complain that there aren't mapy maps - don't forget about difficult levels. I don't think number of maps are important in this kind of games. Many years ago, when Flash Element TD was created, there was only one map but many people enjoyed it for hundreds of hours. Still, there is some variety, so it's not like you don't have any choice at all. Sadly, maybe for me, the number of towers you will be using are very low... maybe I just found out a great tactic so I wasn't in need to use others than 2 or 3. Same goes for weapons - sniper and rocket launcher will alone make you powerful to depend less on towers. Maybe it's because I already had some experience from Sanctum 2, but the difficult level, even the hardest one, was surely more easier than those in second Sanctum game. Still, it can be a really nice challenge for people who enjoys all kind of Tower Defense games. And I recommend even this strange, but very fun, mix. I had really good time playing it and maybe some day I will want to play it once again. Just be sure to have some friends if you want to have fun online, since there aren't many active players.

												I loved playing this game when I was younger, it's a simple tower defense game where you work as a team to destroy monsters and stuff or whatever. But I simply grew out of it and it  doesn't really interest me like that anymore. I would play it for nostaligic reasons, but other than that nothing really enticing me to play it again. It's a good talking piece and it's really fun if you like tower defense games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've never really been interested in tower defence type games, but I saw this on sale and thought I'd give it a go. My son and I play it in coop and its quite good fun, being able to move around the map at ground level installing your armaments rather than just having a top down view, makes it more interesting and being able to be on the map shooting at the enemies along side all the turret guns, mortats, etc, you have positioned makes it great fun. I'd recommend buying it especially while its on sale.			",649,197,28,68,63,9,86

												A unique tower defense game. The elements of strategy is the most among many similar games. I like espeically its variation at depths of defense operations. The player must think beforehand how to arrange the blocks on the broad battlefield in order to stop aliens and maximize their route to the core. Because each kind of alien has its own weakness and abilty, you must rearrange you defense strategy every time they attack with different combinations.To be concluded, this game needs your brain more than others.

												Personal Rating: 5 of 10First Person Shooter with Tower Defense. One of the most looked forward to game but turns out to be rather dissapointing. The game is nice and idea is fresh but this game is not meant to be played alone as it turns out to be a chore. Many tower defense game give you a nice progress with difficulty level scaled to increase in a comfortable manner. This game scale them from 0 to 10 in 3 levels. Before every wave begins, you are allowed to place towers, teleporters, traps, blockage or upgrade your weapon. But first person building is rather redundant and inefficient since you need to keep track on where you are and where you are building. A top down interface to construct tower would be nice since you cannot even do upgrades or construction during a wave. I tried upgrading my weapon and placing some blockade to extend the route. 1st wave seemed easy, 2nd was fine since I upgraded my weapon and so was the 3rd wave. Then came the 4th wave and I can't even kill 25% off them. So all you do is chase the enemies through the maze you plot and fire at will. Not many strategic play involved unless during between waves.This game is clearly made for multiplayer but since its considered outdated, there aren't anyone to play with at all. If you have friends or siblings to play with then this could be fun.			",1029,415,36,151,105,7,188

												This is easily one of the most fun tower defense games I have ever played. Played each of the baloon ones when I was a bit younger and didn't know what steam was. I got into the FPS genre and this is honestly really fun. Just like other TD games, you have towers that you can upgrade as you gain resources after each wave, but you can upgrade your weapons as well. Definitely one of those games that you can play whenever you have some spare time.			",143,18,0,24,9,1,3

												it's a good game if you pick it up for free but not really worth paying much money for. There just isn't enough her to keep you entertained for long. place turret then shoot place turrets then shoot, rinse and repeat. that being said, if there was time and money spent developing the idea then it could be really good. It's just the lack of that hold it back, like every death animation is the same, every effect is the same, there are a very limited amount of weapons that you can have and your just best off maxing out the sniper rifle and spending the rest onn turrets. wich kind of takes most of the stratergy out of the game. it can be fun for the first few hours but soon you realise that your main job is to attack targets the turrets can't shoot. mainly it's just the lack of variety that lets this game down. It actually reminds me a lot of early 1990's titles like battlezone where they where limited by what a computer can do except in terms of how many units spawn. clearly someone worked really hard but they where mainly alone in their endevors and had extreme budget limitations. worth playing but doesn't have a long lasting playability.

												This review originally written on June 18, 2012 on GameFAQs""A unique tower defense and FPS hybrid worthy of your time.""Sanctum is a tower defense game at its heart. You build towers and create mazes to stop the waves of enemies. All of this is in done in first person and when the wave starts you can use your 3 guns to personally attack the enemies. As the developers have said this is the first game ever to have this combination and it sure is fun!GRAPHICS: 10/10The graphics are pretty good all around. It can be taxing on older computers so it should be noted that the developers have thoughtfully allowed you to edit the engine files to reduce the graphics even further. To me this is a huge plus because if I couldn't do that I couldn't play this game. My only complaint is that the lower your resolution the fuzzier the text gets. I can barely read it at 800x600. The higher your resolution the harder the game is on your computer. That said this game lets you go down all the way to 320x200! So if your computer is real bad you can turn the resolution down that far and play with ease when you start the wave, then turn it up in between waves to build.SOUND: 9/10There are some nice sound effects when you build and do things like that. The gun sounds are kind of lackluster but this isn't heavily focused on that. Nothing bad about the monster sounds either. The music is actually really good and doesn't get repetitive or annoying.STORYNo score because there isn't a story and tower defense games don't necessarily need one. I think they have released some lore and stuff in preparation for the sequel but I haven't read any of it. All I know is that you're a girl and you have something on your left arm that allows you to build towers. Your goal is to stop the invading monsters from getting to the giant blue core. What that core is I don't know.TOWER DEFENSE ASPECT: 10/10As I said this game is tower defense at its heart and it does not disappoint. There are several tower types, all useful to varying degrees depending on your play style. Something this game does that sadly few TDs do is allowing you to build a maze that the enemies are forced to run through. This allows for even more strategy than just simply building at certain spots outside of the enemies' route. On most maps you can create their route! You also have a set amount of towers equipped that you can then use to build on the level. This means even more strategy.FIRST PERSON SHOOTER ASPECT: 9/10This game is a shooter at a distant second. When you manually start the next wave of enemies you can then shoot them with your own weapons which you choose before the level starts. This part of the game is pretty basic as expected. The weapons are simple but each one does have an alternate fire which adds more variety. You can also upgrade them with your money to make them stronger. Despite shooting not being the main focus it's still essential for beating the levels.What gives this a 9/10 instead of something lower is the fact that all enemies have a weak spot that can be exploited by you for a great increase in damage. Further, some enemies can only be killed by hitting them in their weak spot, something that isn't easy for your towers. There is an enemy that can only be hurt from its back. A tall enemy with a bobbing head that only takes damage from attacks to its head. Still another that has armor that greatly reduces damage to it and the only way to temporarily remove the armor is for a single concentrated shot (sniper) to hit it in the head. All this means a lot more strategy and player input is required than just simply shooting the enemy. Unfortunately if you have horrendous aiming skills you may have trouble, but there is an easy difficulty for you to enjoy.ENEMIES: 9/10There are more enemy types than the ones listed above, and they're all distinct. There are also flying enemies which pay no heed to your carefully made mazes. The designs are unique and interesting and follow a similar theme.LENGTH AND REPLAYABILITYThere are several maps to enjoy including a few free ones and others you must pay for (worth it). Each map has 4 difficulties as well as various survival modes to play. On normal a map will take an hour or so to beat. There is also multiplayer but I never messed with that.FINAL SCORE: 9/10This is a must play for any fan of tower defense, if only to check out something new and unique in the genre. Even if you aren't into TDs check this game out (so long as you at least like FPSs) and who knows it just might get you into the genre. I got this game on a sale and it's worth it even at full price. There is a demo so if you aren't sure give it a spin.			",1467,508,45,195,107,13,226

												Amazing game, combines both FPS shooter and tower defense into 1 greate game, I would recommend anyone to buy this. Its great for two players and has interesting achievments. The scenario on each map is amazing and wandering around it is even better. (SPOILER) On the first map theres something interesting under the bridge if you look carefully and each map has something special on it which makes the game even better. You dont always have to fight you can wander around the map. Overall I would rate this 10/10.			",54,21,4,3,8,1,2

												I recommend this game it is not a waste of time. The game is a HUD-interactive tower defense where you choose what to build and upgrade, while fighting a horde of monsters. There are 6(maybe more!) weapons and about 12 different types of tower you can build. It is maybe the only game where single player is actually fun. Of course, there is a multiplayer mode where you can battle and cooperate with your friends while building and upgrading buildings to reach the perfect strategy. RECOMMENDED 5/5			",71,16,2,6,9,1,9

												Where to begin? Okay simply put: Do you like tower defense?, DO you enjoy Strategy? Do you ENjoy FPS's? Do you enjoy CHallenge? If you answered yest to 2 more more of those questions, you'll enjoy this game.This game is fun, fast paced and almost insanely challenging, but it makes wining the statges that much more rewarding. It's not just about placing your turrents it's about placing those turrets and emptying a full salvo from your rocket launcher at anyone unfortunate enough to survive your tower maze of doom!There is no greater joy that to see a battered giant on his last bit of health as he rounds the final corner and limps out of the death mage and straight into the crosshairs of your sniper rifle.

												This is my favorite game of all time.Now, it may not be what you want, but you might want to pikc it up, just to see what its like.Being in a first person percpective and shooting aliens is great and all, but this game offers a little bit more.Its part tower-defense, so you can place down blocks and then place the shooting towers on the blocks.You can upgrade your towers and your guns, but those upgrades only last for the current game.The co-op is really fun, having to build towers and plan out everything.If you don't know the person, its not as fun.So I'll recommend this game to whatever FPS/Tower Defense fanatics want a combo, or if you want to try something new.

												If you like Tower Defense games, this is one game for you.You control one builder, FPS, and swap between building tower or upgrading weapons mode. You need also to build blocks to maze enemies. Your job is to stop them from reaching the destination, by blocking their paths and shooting them down yourself with your towers to support you.Once you complete building phase, you enter combat phase. A series of mob will come from one point to another point at the end of the map. Prevent them.Combat system is flawless, you can move freely from point to point, or teleport instantly to where the system allows. This gives freedom and more strategies when combating enemies.Minus point, too few maps to play in. Extra maps require you to purchase DLCs,			",1570,616,62,187,177,20,271

												This is my favorite game of all time.Now, it may not be what you want, but you might want to pikc it up, just to see what its like.Being in a first person percpective and shooting aliens is great and all, but this game offers a little bit more.Its part tower-defense, so you can place down blocks and then place the shooting towers on the blocks.You can upgrade your towers and your guns, but those upgrades only last for the current game.The co-op is really fun, having to build towers and plan out everything.If you don't know the person, its not as fun.So I'll recommend this game to whatever FPS/Tower Defense fanatics want a combo, or if you want to try something new.

												This game is okay, but it needed to have a watered down, drop-in, fun, multiplayer difficulty setting. I didn't think I'd need to read a three page essay, in order to play one match with a friend(That experience still bites four years later). Otherwise yeah, singleplayer is exactly what you'd imagine, after seeing the promotional materials. It's uninspired and tonedeaf, with a single gimmick as its vital selling point. I did not enjoy this game and I can't recommend it to others.			",123,10,0,21,12,0,30

												I got this game from a Humble Bundle pack. Not entirely free, but for practical purposes you could say so.From an aesthetics and design perspective, this game is top notch. It also has a decent kind of humour in it that I enjoy. None-the-less the FPS facet of this game is quite lacking. For the sake of a functional tower defense game the enemies must travel in very specific ways with very predictable behaviour and that is as good for an FPS as the ducks in Duck Hunt. Anyone who knows what's he/she's doing will be able to emplace a couple of guns at the enemies' spawn point, then make a tight corridor with Amp Fields and Holo-blocks (bullet damage multipliers) and just sit at the end of the corridor holding the mouse button. The gun overheated? No problem! swap to the Sniper rifle and click instead of holding. That run out too? switch back! Needless to say that the protagonist sounds way more into that than me.In case you're in doubt, yes, there's no ammo count in this game. The sniper rifle and shotgun have between 1 and 6 shots, all other guns are based on ""overheating"".If you like either fishing or tower defense games, you might like this one. If you want a solo or co-op game to shoot at waves of monsters which can actually react to you and give you action, then pick Killing Floor 2 instead.			",80,8,1,2,5,0,8

												Came in looking for the Tower Defense style of games, and was intrigued by the addition of the FPS-style. I think it was fun to pop in and play for a little while, but the old feel of Warcraft 3-era Tower Defense Mods I was looking for was lost since I only got the chance to play by myself. I found myself mainly booting it up for a few waves while waiting for friends to sign online to play other games. Would be great as a tablet game to play on train/plane rides, but I don't think I'd sit down and dedicate long stretches of time to just Sanctum.I think if you're looking at it from a fresh perspective, go ahead and give it a whirl. If you're looking for something like a Green TD, Wintermaul style of game though, I would give it a pass since it doesn't compare to those game's play style.			",32,3,0,3,1,0,6

												the levels are amazing and selection of towers and guns are awsome however by the second mission I felt like the difficulty had been cranked all the way to god mode, while i was able to fend off hoards of monsters before they even touched the mining platform in the first level, in the second, i could barely kill half the hoards that where coming thru even with a complex maze. so while the game itself is good, the difficulty kinda makes it unplayable for me.

												-only played durring a free weekend-While Sanctum wasn't bad; it just seemed to be lack a sense of purpose, and in areas that other simular games have gotten right. Your time and money may be better spent on Orcs Must Die for the FPS tower defense with some amusing dialog, and Defense Grid for the alien Tower Defense (not FPS).I will be looking to Sanctum 2, with hopes it filled some of the lack luster this game had. The good things: I have to say is it looked good, and movement was very fluid (unreal engine to thank?).If you really love tower defense games, give it a spin, but only if you've play the others that it is like.

												The game felt very lonley. It lacked a story and while it may have been better had I played multiplayer it felt really empty on single player. So much so that I really didn't want to continue. I did notice a bigger focus on weapons rather than towers. I always got better results by making simple mazes and then focusing my income on improving weapons instead of towers. Unfotunitly there's a build phase and an enemy phase. So you can't build on the fly like most tower defense games. Because of that you can't fix mistakes you may have made or improve as needed like other tower defense games and because of that I felt very restricted. Again it was make maze shoot with gun. It just couldn't keep my interest in comparison to other tower games like Defense Grid or Orcs must die.			",281,75,4,39,25,4,53

												Willing to admit it maybbe as I've gotten older I've gotten worse at video games, but this one is just too hard to be enjoyable. Experimentation becomes tedious as you're forced to reply multiple levels if you mess up on one, and it seems like you have to perfecltly figure out each level rather than having multiple solutions if you want to survive. You're also unable to upgrade weapons and go back to play levels that were too hard in the first place, so for me there was 0 replayability.			",25,3,0,0,1,0,0

												Pre-Word: I may be heavyly biased, as I played the heck out of TD games in my early years and after tons of repetitive flash games, I generally consider all TD's outright boring nowadays.And that's what Sanctum is. A tower defense game, played from a first persion view. You got some weapons, but even if priorizing to upgrade those, it's more like you're assissting the towers in doing their job (f.e. by freezing enemies in tower range, dropping the shields of tanks with precision sniping or killing enemies that can only be attacked from behind).In it's core, it's still just a TD. And, if I may so, a pretty shallow one at that. I've seen and played FLASH tower defense games, YEARS ago, which had mroe varied content, enemies, tactics.Let's add the mediocre graphic onto this and the... well, there is a store, but it's barely communicated. Which is a pity, because the atmosphere was supposed to be a good part about the game.Overall, this title really didn't amaze or catch me.Result: 4/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's difficult and unintuitive to navigate, the UI and controls are poorly designed, when creating a base of operations it feels less like your base and more like a confusing hodgpodge of difficult to navigate structures. Combat is confusing and feels like a poorly designed FPS mashed with some random turrets.Overall, it's a good idea that needs a lot of polish.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I find Sanctum's first person tower defense (with heroes) style clunky, boring and overrated. The controls and user interface are the primary source of frustration. At no point do I feel in complete control of my game, unlike in better examples of this concept (Orcs Must Die).The mix of genres presented here doesn't work for my tastes. Basically for Tower Defense I'd rather play a top-down game like Defense Grid, for a first-person shooter co-operative survival mode I'd rather play Left 4 Dead or TF2's MvM mode. For the genre-mix I'd much rather play the Orcs Must Die series. I cannot recommend Sanctum. I would, however be curious to see how the concepts presented here have perhaps been polished in the sequel, Sanctum 2.			",176,23,1,9,6,0,20

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, ""If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately."" Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- ""Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 3 thousand26four, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very large sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			",69,5,1,10,3,0,0

												Could be good. But:Can't build during a wave.You have no idea what to build for the next wave (see previous problem)You can't change tower or weapon loadouts once a level is startedYou can't build in overview modeSo basically... no fun at all. You have to memorize each wave to build correctly which means if on wave three one gets to the core, you have to go back to wave one start all over. Then repeat the process for each consecutive wave. I've started the first level twenty times and still haven't gotten past wave five without at least one getting to core. ",203,33,9,27,4,2,7

Sanctum's UI is clunky, tower building is awkward, information on towers that's clearly provided in Sanctum 2 is obfuscated here, gameplay is less fluid and fun; it's just all-around an inferior experience.

												The co-op mode for this game in unbearable. I played this with one of my friends and we had the best maze possbile with leveled up towers. But guest what! They send either 500 speedy units that you can only kill a few or they said a about 5 giant units with around 10,000,000 hp. I thinking I got this since I upgraded my sniper rifle and the damage ampfing square to the max level doing around 1 million damage per shot. But guest what! There big monsters just laugh at the damage and just go on slowly to your base. There is no stratgeay  when all you do is sit there following the monsters shooting at them. I feel like all the towers don't do anything but add a little damage here and there even though they are full upgraded. The anti air towers are the only good towers. I can tell that the multiplayer was meant for 4 players and if you got anything less than that you're going to lose. The sad thing is your not just going to be killed but your going to be absolutely destroyed. They would kill us and there would still be about 50 more units still alive. To conclude this, I think Orcs Must Die! 2 did the tower defense with fps better. You felt like you could win, you felt like with one more try you could beat the enemy; in this game all I felt like was that the game was just being really cheap and unfair. I just started and the game expected prefection. Although I heard the single player was better. But again, surprise surprise, the levels are so BORING AND LONG. I couldn't recommend this.

												Tower defense games have been one of my favorite genres since the old days of Warcraft 3 custom maps.  I've played (and thoroughly enjoyed) many TD's, like Deathtrap, Dungeon Defenders 1, Orcs Must Die, and more.But this... ugh.It BOMBARDS you with way too many towers and weapons all at once.  I don't really get why most every tower needs to be built on a block.  I could use more specific information on tower damage to help me learn strengths and weaknesses vs certain enemies.  How do I know which lane is going to be used next?  The graphics are kinda blocky and bad.  Am I really supposed to get on top of a tower and shoot enemies there?  Many of them run so fast I have to chase after them, shooting them in the butt.  The sound effects are generally headache-inducing, especially the menu ones.  And worst of all, being first person means you can't see what's going on.  Even a Dungeon Defenders style of camera would be preferable.On the plus side... uh... honestly, I can't think of a plus side here :(			",13,11,0,19,0,0,1

												Sanctum 2 has much more freedom than this game and is much more fun. I am not a fan of this game although I wanted to be until I very quickly realized how they designed it. You have to be very specific with your tower placement and upgrades to be successful. The ability to play how you want to play is nearly nonexistent. It's like the developers said ""we are releasing our game for you to play and you will play it how WE want you to play it, not how you want to play it"". You cannot place the towers that you want and certain enemies require gun upgrades moreso than tower upgrades and so on and so forth, and those are just scratching the surface of the large amount of underlying rules that exist within this game's trial-and-error-exclusive play structure that shackle you to playing how they intend you to play and only how they intended. Throw out any thoughts of playing how you want and using any kind of common sense strategy that you have learned from over 90% of other good tower defense games out the window.Needs more freedom 5/10			",598,87,12,48,22,5,43

												Never really rose to the heights that I hoped it would. The co-op is fun with a few mates, but the strategy is basic at best. Simply make your maze as long as possible and spam turrets everywhere - the more the merrier. Since waves are generally mixed enemy types, there's no real need to redesign your defence at all after each wave, just keep adding to it. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, but there doesn't seem to be enough thoughtful play here to keep me at it for too long.Nice idea, but poor execution.5/10			",170,26,9,33,58,9,54

												Sanctum is a first person shooter mixed with a ""Bloons Tower Defense"" game. You start off with a giant grid of blue squares that signal where you can build you blocks. You must strategize your blocks so that you can make the longest possible path for the enemies. The reason you must do this? You're protecting your core. The enemies are trying to kamikazi their way into your core, which damages it, until the point it reaches 0% life left, where it explodes and you lose. Anyways, these blocks you place are used to equip various towers on top of them, which shoot the monsters as they go by, helping you stop their relentless attack. Being that there are many different towers, each with their strengths and weaknesses against the many different monsters, it makes the game a very strategic problem. Each tower can be upgraded to become more damaging and quicker. Being that there are so many towers, you must choose your favorite ones before starting, as you can't have them all. Often, I was always pounded with the inability to decide if I want one tower or the other tower more. The monsters come in many different shapes, sizes, strengths, and weaknesses. One wave, you may have 100 really small and fast crawling bugs, while in the other wave, you may have 5 extremely strong but slow ""tank"" monsters. Each monster has a weakness against a certain tower/weapon, but it's up to you to figure it out. For instance, the tank monsters are undamaged by most assault gun shots, but are weak against rocket launcher attacks. Each monster also has a major weakspot on its body, where it is most damaged if you hit it there. Each monster's weakspot is in a different place, some are on the back of their heads, while others (known as bobbleheads) have it on the top of their heads and move their heads around, making it hard to hit. Oh, did I mention that some of the monsters fly? Yep, that's right, they fly right over your maze and into your core! Luckily, the game has a tower to take on each monster. Finally, the game lets you fight WHILE the wave is happening. So you set up your maze and press enter, the wave starts. Now you, the player, get to shoot the monsters, helping your towers in the attempt to stop their advance. You also have many weapons to choose from, but can only have 3. The game itself is great. The music is just amazing. If the game was more popular, that music would be getting awards. The graphics...just wow. Each map is in a giant world, full of color and hidden easter eggs. Between waves, I would constantly go out and just look around at all the amazing designs. If you press escape, it enables you to see what is coming in the next few waves, informs you about the monsters, and helps you figure out what the towers and guns do. Not to mention, the typing in game does that whole google translate voice, so whatever you type is actually said out loud. Oh yeah, you can also rocket jump.Finally, the lagging...or lack of it. At times, you have 60 enemies flooding through your maze as you shoot off rocket launcher rounds into them, while your 30 towers are firing shot after shot into them and as monster part fly everywhere, AND YOU'RE STILL NOT LAGGING. I've only experienced lag once in this game, and it wasn't even major lag in the slightest. For instance, one of my favorite towers in the game is called the ""Scatter Laser"" tower. It shoots low damage bolts of electricity at the enemies extremely fast. Now, I'll spam these on a bunch of my blocks and have 40 of them helping me defend. So I'll just stop firing and look at them shooting, all 40 of them shooting about 6 shots a second and how smooth it is. If you're worried about lagging, this game won't supply lag.Sanctum is an amazing game and deserves way more attention that it gets. I really hope my review influences you to buy the game.

												Liking tower defense games, but hating fps, i found this game incredibly amazing. IMO this edition of Sanctum is way better than the second one because this one doesn't have as many restrictions as the second one, which gives a wider number of strategies for clearing some levels, without focusing that much in the FPS side. But seriously, amazing game, so worth the price for the play time. 9.5/10			",85,13,3,12,9,0,9

The devs are very active on the forums, and actually listening and changing the problems. The 3 maps they have(more coming free of charge) are very challenging and their are endless maze options. This game makes you think very hard. Should you upgrade towers, or your guns? Which gun should i upgrade? Which tower? Which of the 3 spawning units should I concentrate fire on?

												So I started playing Sanctum last time they had a free weekend (like a year ago?) I didn't buy it then, but I bought it now. I think this is my new favorite Tower Defense game. It happens to also be an FPS. So you walk around the map, laying down your towers of varying types (as in any TD game). Then when the action starts, not only do your towers start shooting, but so do you. So while your turrets are killing aliens, you're running and jumping and shooting them as well.At first I was like ""Meh. Whatever. I'll let my towers do all the work and just keep an eye on things and mop up any leaks."" Nope. You can't win at this game without a good tower strategy AND a good supplemental sniper rifle strategy.For example, there are certain enemies that are armored and take zero damage until a shot to the head makes them vulnerable for about ten seconds. Once in a while, a tower will get lucky. But most of the time you need to do that♥♥♥♥♥♥yourself.So I give Sanctum an A-.			",168,33,0,50,30,4,67

												Sanctum is probably one of the most fun I've had in a tower defense game. It mixes tower defense with a first person shooter, which really mixes up the combat. You have a huge variety of turrets and weapons. Each level starts off a blank slate and you choose where to place blocks, creating the enemy AI pathing. These blocks can be upgraded to any turret or platform you want. There is also this thing they call a transelevator (or something similiar) that you can use to either transport to another one on the map or use it to get ontop of that block and walk along the high blocks, perfect for when your shooting your own weapons, like the Assualt rifle, sniper rifle or the slow enemies down weaopon. Each gun has alternative fires/modes. I really recommend this game to people who are tired of ToD games or have never tried one before. It's a fresh change that I really liked.

												Gue cinta FPS, gue cinta Tower Defense. Maka gue bercinta dengan mereka, lahirlah FPSTower Defense.Gue menulis review ini setelah 2 jam bermain. Walau pun begitu, udah cukup buat gue untuk memberikan nilai kepada game ini 8,5 dari 10.Kesan pertama: grafiknya diatas ekspektasi gue. Jujur, gue agak segan untuk memainkan game yang dibawah 2012 kebawah. Kenapa? karena biasanya sih grafiknya itu standart 'kotak-kotak' banget. Teksturnya kasar, resolusinya kecil, dan tidak 'wah'. Tapi ternyata Sanctum menawarkan gue grafik yang memukau. Banget. Waktu gue main di map pertama, gue bingung. Ini teh tower defense? atau FPS terus kita musti nembak nembakin monster? Biasanya pula kan tower defense itu FOV nya dari atas, ini kenapa malah ada dibawah? Hmmm... Sanctum bener bener membawa PENGALAMAN BARU buat gue sebagai gamer yang udah rajin main game sejak SD.Grafik: WOW. Seperti yang gue bilang tadi, Sanctum memiliki grafik yang memukau. Gue merasa ketinggalan jaman banget baru nemu game seindah ini. Gak cuman cukup detail, tapi efek dari peluru, laser, listrik, kabut, dan berbagai atmosfernya bener bener menyatu. Gue heran, apakah ini beneran dirilis tahun 2011? Game tahun 2014 aja grafiknya belum tentu seindah ini lho. Jadi bagi yang merasa mempunyai fetish dengan grafik, tenang aja... hasrat lo dijamin terpuaskan. Gameplay: CLASSIC ADDICTING PUZZLED TOWER DEFENSE. Ada banyak elemen menarik didalam game ini. Maksud dari classic disetiap game tower defense, selalu ada yang namanya upgrade. Dengan biaya tertentu, lo bisa mengupgrade tower lo menjadi lebih kuat, cepat, dan keren. Tapi gak cuman itu doang, elemen lainnya adalah PUZZLED. Yup, biasanya kan kalau tower defense itu lo hanya sebatas memilih tower untuk ditempatkan. Beberapa game malah membatasi penempatan tower. Begitu juga dengan map nya, kebanyakan game tower defense itu mapnya sudah diatur jalannya. Ditambah lagi, FOV nya juga SELALU DIATAS. Beruntungnya, Sanctum BERBEDA. Lo BEBAS menaruh tower dimana saja, lo BEBAS membentuk jalur untuk musuh, dan ini adalah game FPS. Yup, enggak cuman tower lo doang yang bisa nembakin musuh, tapi lo juga bisa. Ada berbagai macam senjata didalam game ini dan hebatnya, senjata lo juga bisa DIUPGRADE. Jadi ini bener bener pilihan lo, apakah lo ingin MENJEBAK MUSUH dengan tower lo atau HEAD TO HEAD bersama senjata lo. Belum sampai disitu, Sanctum juga menawarkan fitur multiplayer. Tapi karena gue belum mencoba, jadi gue gak bisa kasih informasi.Storyline: SAMA SEKALI GAK ADA. Yup, begitu lo selesai tutorial, lo langsung main mempertahankan base lo. Tidak ada kata pengantar sama sekali. Padahal yah storyline bisa menjadi pemain memiliki pengalaman emosional yang lebih dalam dengan game ini. Simple aja, misalnya siapa itu Sanctum? Bagaimana senjata ini atau tower itu dibuat? Darimana aliennya muncul? Kenapa aliennya menyerang kita? Tapi apakah tidak ada storyline maka menjadi game yang mengecewakan? Nope. Game ini cukup menarik WALAU tanpa storyline.Gue berani kasih skor 8,5 dari 10.Kenapa? Karena Sanctum benar benar menawarkan pengalaman baru yaitu FPS Tower Defense. Sayangnya tidak ada storyline atau steamworkshop. Game ini pantas dibeli dengan harga $10. So andaikan kalau game ini mendadak diskon sampai 90%, LO BENER BENER MUSTI MEMBELI.			",152,22,5,11,8,0,17

												Ok, so I decided I would redo my Sanctum 1 review since I did terrible Sanctum 2, so I'll just explain why I prefer THIS one over the 2nd one.PROS:The game itself: I want to point this out to EVERYONE who apparently likes Sanctum 2 better, Sanctum 1 is a tower based game with FPS elements, so you can help your towers out as well as have something to do than just sit there.  The 2nd one is FPS based with towers involved and I HATE that, the best part about the first one was the huge maps, level up weapons, level up towers and killingfloors to high levels to do a s%#ton of damage with, teleport around the place getting in enemies faces, get infront of them to block them off so they couldn't get closer, etc. and that's why I loved it, the FPS part was just there for some entertainment and to help out friends/towers so you would have something to doLarge maps: A good chunk of the maps in this game are actually really big, seriously, some of the maps are ginormous and you have to be careful about where you put your towers, as well as where you should stand to help them out.Weapons/Pick your own weapons: There are multiple weapons to pick from, i'm not going to list them all but i'll say my favorties are R.E.X., the Tesla Gun, and the Sniper, and leveling them up means more damage and more ammo, as well as quicker reload times.  And to top it all off you can pick your weapons instead of being forced 1 weapon, AND you also get 3 weapons instead of 2, making it more fun.Level up weapons: This is another thing I adored about the first one, the level up system for weapons.  How this works is that you switch to your weapon inbetween rounds with SHIFT, and hold LMB (if you have enough money) And it upgrades it to the next level, the higher the level the more damage you do with it, there is a limit but it does a lot of damage.NO. F%$KING. TOWER LIMIT: I hated this SO MUCH about the 2nd, there isn't a tower/block limit, there isn't, if you have the money and it isn't blocking the enemies path then you can put it there, and that's why I liked it, I hate how the 2nd one you have a limit, why a limit? That was one of the great things about the first one.No stupid boss fights: There are no boss fights in this game, and that's another thing I like and don't like, I wish there was a big enemy to fight but in the 2nd one he's just a a$$hole.  Me and my friends spent 20 minutes in Sanctum 2 on the last wave and putting towers in places and making a longer maze for the boss, well apparently the boss gave us a middle finger and plowed through it all, making all of our time and money utterly useless, after we saw that we quit and played the first game again.Towers:  Like I said in the first statement that this is a Tower based game with FPS elements, which means the towers do a good chunk of work and you are the support instead of it being vice versa.  There are multiple types of towers, my personal favorties are the killing floor which sits on the ground, and any enemy that runs over it takes damage, AND slows him down for a few seconds, and theres also this one with a long a$$ neck that pretty snipe enemies from across the map in a few hits.  There are others of course, try em out!Teleport system: If you fall off the map or are wanting to go up to the front/back of the complex to get at enemies or just for the fun of it you can teleport around if you put down some teleport pads, makes it easy to swap around the map and help out friends or to get to enemies quickly instead of running there.You can't die:  Yup, you aren't able to die at all and I like that a lot, it doesn't put a whole lot of tension or anything, if you fall off the map you just pick a place to teleport at with no worries.Core: The Core is what you are trying to protect the aliens from, if too many get in it explodes and you lose, the bigger the enemy the more health it takes off, and you can't get any back, so keep those b@$#ards away from it at all costs.No timer: I hated this about the 2nd as well, in the first inbetween rounds you get no timer, as much time as you need to set up your maze for enemies or put towers in places, get to certain high points for sniping, anything.  In the 2nd inbetween rounds half the time you get like 30 seconds to do whatever it is you have to before it starts and I hated that.Enemy hits: If a enemy hits you you don't lose health or anything, he just knocks you back and shakes your camera around, making it a little woozy, then when your senses come back you can go after the guy that hit you.CONS:Teleport pads: At times when I was playing I would hug against a wall so I wouldn't get knocked back, but I ran back somehow cause a telepad came down to pick me up and I went back too far and into the hoard on the other side and I kind of got stuck.  I don't know if this is a nitpick or something that people hate cause my friends do it constantly as well and they get annoyed with it.Towers: Some towers feel utterly useless, for instance there is a slow-pad for the floor like a Killing Floor is used, it slows the enemies down alot but doesn't do damage, when the Killing Floor does damage and slows them down abit.  And some are useful for only certain types, for instance gattling guns are for ground units only, and missile launchers for air targets only, some of them are mixed though, so they hit both air and ground units.Longer waves mean harder enemies: When you upgrade all of your towers and weapons you would imagine you would be set, sadly that isn't true, as waves go on enemies get harder and harder with each wave, one time I had all of my towers (except 2-3) and all of my weapons upgraded and I was expecting to wipe the floor with everyone, but halfway through the wave the enemies were getting past my maze pretty quickly, and still had chunks of health left so I had to go back to the core and pick them off one by one, I lost sadly.  I would recommend you play with friends that way you can all gang up on the aliens.WHAT I THINK:  I think this was the actual good game of the 2, even half of my friends who played the 1st and 2nd prefer the 1st one instead, I still play this game on occassion because it's still entertaining to me, and I love it for that, it has quite high replayability, and the text-to-voice chat system is just downright hilarious, I give this game a 8/10, it needs some fixing with some things but it's still very fun all around.  Worth it on a sale or as it sits!			",379,41,2,15,16,2,13

I prefer to call to a sort of ""Tower defense Minecraft"". I know that's extremely corny, but I'm serious! All the towers are placed on holographic blocks!If you like FPS and Tower Defense games, then this is one not to miss. Best $2.50 I have ever spent.			",334,86,14,22,32,7,33

												Let me be the first to say that I generally hate tower defense games. Now this, on the other hand, is one way to do them right. A mix of tower defense and FPS, you spend half of the time building your defenses up and plotting the path you want your enemies to take, and other other half on the ground and taking it to them directly. It supports up to four player co-op, and this is how you need to play. Solo, it's a bit too dry, but the second you add another person in, it gets so much better. Pick this game up if you have some friends to join you.			",759,206,29,90,55,11,99

												I brought Sanctum in a Steam sale not really having any idea what the hell it was, and it was just left in my Steam library, downloaded - but neglected. Until I was forced to open it for the first time for a Steam achievement prize thinge. And wow, it's an awesome game! As a lover of FPS's and also Tower Defences (See: Bloons Tower Defence 4) this game is amazing. Being able to walk around a map, place 3D towers, and then also shot the many waves of aliens makes a very fun game.			",152,14,6,10,22,0,29

												An interesting mix of First Person Shooter and Tower Defence. Overall it is a fun game in a unique style and I enjoyed playing through it. Probably the most annoying part is getting half way through a mission and realising that you should have chosen a certain type of tower or personal weapon and have to start the level over again from the beginning. This is annoying as each level can take several hours.3/5			",63,37,0,16,12,0,40

												A tower defense game mixed with first person shooter?  oddly it works, and it works that well that there now are dozens of other games that offers the same.  Yet the charm of having an empty field in which you and your team can design your maze from scratch is just great. Also your chat is turned from text to speech in a male scientist voice and extra fun to be had to have it pronounce the weirdest of things inbetween the waves of monsters.			",93,25,3,23,18,2,33

												Sanctum is a amazing Tower Defense/FPS Title and here is why.In this review as always I will show the good and the bad.Good.1.Not only is it an tower defense game is has elements of FPS2.You can lvl up your towers and guns3.Is it not the average tower defense game... ITS BETTER4.If you want to play a game for a long a mount of time this is good for.5.Its a tower defence game with mutiliplayer (I havent seen that done before whoever you may have)Bad.1.Not good if you wont to play a quick game.Here are some things other people said:fraserlm.1 said ""A tower defence game WITH a first person shooter- like Terraria IT'S EPIC!!!""Luraim said: ""If you are reading this review right now, and consider buying the game, do it. It's that simple, the game is totally worth the money.""Finally said:""Wonderful, innovative, and fun. This is a great go-to LAN game, and the DLC was really entertaining. How many games have an easter egg involving shooting santa out of the sky? This one. 9/10.""Kimi said:""Just ew - 1/10""Valetine said:""I did notice a bigger focus on weapons rather than towers. I always got better results by making simple mazes and then focusing my income on improving weapons instead of towers.""I said:""It focus on either weapons or towers which one you want to focus on youcan focus on it unless you like doing the best which is having them balanced like most people do.""B-Man99 said ""Considering the concept and the genre it falls into, this game pulls off a fun and quality experience very well""_OVERALL_I give this game 8/10  ",79,18,1,6,22,0,5

												With the tower defence aspect you can just play casually and enjoy the carnage but with the FPS part of it you can jump into the fight if you feel like it and use weapons like the rex to just explode everything into submission.

												It's unfortunate that a purely good title like this is crippled by the need to replay every stage until you get that ""just right"" configuration to your defences. Starting at the second map you'll spend quite a few waves thinking that you are a complete idiot for not getting the configuration in that one and only pattern that would keep you from losing any life during the first moments of a level. One major slip in the defense grid and you'll find yourself on the tail end of a stream of enemies that nearly destroy you. I do like this game, but I can't say that I love it due to that one fact, I don't recommend this to anyone who is an utter perfectionist, you shouldn't have to consult a walkthrough to figure out how to start a level.

												It's really fun for a $10 (or less!) indie game!Good singleplayed and multiplayer (coop). The waves are really really difficult as well (unless you are like me and play the easiest difficulty with friends and still sometimes lose :p)Probably the worst part of the game is that although there is a fair amount of map and monster diversity, you soon get stuck in a rut in terms of what your strategy is, and then it can become monotonous.Still, I've played worse $50 games than this!

												Ok, so I decided I would redo my Sanctum 1 review since I did terrible Sanctum 2, so I'll just explain why I prefer THIS one over the 2nd one.PROS:The game itself: I want to point this out to EVERYONE who apparently likes Sanctum 2 better, Sanctum 1 is a tower based game with FPS elements, so you can help your towers out as well as have something to do than just sit there.  The 2nd one is FPS based with towers involved and I HATE that, the best part about the first one was the huge maps, level up weapons, level up towers and killingfloors to high levels to do a s%#ton of damage with, teleport around the place getting in enemies faces, get infront of them to block them off so they couldn't get closer, etc. and that's why I loved it, the FPS part was just there for some entertainment and to help out friends/towers so you would have something to doLarge maps: A good chunk of the maps in this game are actually really big, seriously, some of the maps are ginormous and you have to be careful about where you put your towers, as well as where you should stand to help them out.Weapons/Pick your own weapons: There are multiple weapons to pick from, i'm not going to list them all but i'll say my favorties are R.E.X., the Tesla Gun, and the Sniper, and leveling them up means more damage and more ammo, as well as quicker reload times.  And to top it all off you can pick your weapons instead of being forced 1 weapon, AND you also get 3 weapons instead of 2, making it more fun.Level up weapons: This is another thing I adored about the first one, the level up system for weapons.  How this works is that you switch to your weapon inbetween rounds with SHIFT, and hold LMB (if you have enough money) And it upgrades it to the next level, the higher the level the more damage you do with it, there is a limit but it does a lot of damage.NO. F%$KING. TOWER LIMIT: I hated this SO MUCH about the 2nd, there isn't a tower/block limit, there isn't, if you have the money and it isn't blocking the enemies path then you can put it there, and that's why I liked it, I hate how the 2nd one you have a limit, why a limit? That was one of the great things about the first one.No stupid boss fights: There are no boss fights in this game, and that's another thing I like and don't like, I wish there was a big enemy to fight but in the 2nd one he's just a a$$hole.  Me and my friends spent 20 minutes in Sanctum 2 on the last wave and putting towers in places and making a longer maze for the boss, well apparently the boss gave us a middle finger and plowed through it all, making all of our time and money utterly useless, after we saw that we quit and played the first game again.Towers:  Like I said in the first statement that this is a Tower based game with FPS elements, which means the towers do a good chunk of work and you are the support instead of it being vice versa.  There are multiple types of towers, my personal favorties are the killing floor which sits on the ground, and any enemy that runs over it takes damage, AND slows him down for a few seconds, and theres also this one with a long a$$ neck that pretty snipe enemies from across the map in a few hits.  There are others of course, try em out!Teleport system: If you fall off the map or are wanting to go up to the front/back of the complex to get at enemies or just for the fun of it you can teleport around if you put down some teleport pads, makes it easy to swap around the map and help out friends or to get to enemies quickly instead of running there.You can't die:  Yup, you aren't able to die at all and I like that a lot, it doesn't put a whole lot of tension or anything, if you fall off the map you just pick a place to teleport at with no worries.Core: The Core is what you are trying to protect the aliens from, if too many get in it explodes and you lose, the bigger the enemy the more health it takes off, and you can't get any back, so keep those b@$#ards away from it at all costs.No timer: I hated this about the 2nd as well, in the first inbetween rounds you get no timer, as much time as you need to set up your maze for enemies or put towers in places, get to certain high points for sniping, anything.  In the 2nd inbetween rounds half the time you get like 30 seconds to do whatever it is you have to before it starts and I hated that.Enemy hits: If a enemy hits you you don't lose health or anything, he just knocks you back and shakes your camera around, making it a little woozy, then when your senses come back you can go after the guy that hit you.CONS:Teleport pads: At times when I was playing I would hug against a wall so I wouldn't get knocked back, but I ran back somehow cause a telepad came down to pick me up and I went back too far and into the hoard on the other side and I kind of got stuck.  I don't know if this is a nitpick or something that people hate cause my friends do it constantly as well and they get annoyed with it.Towers: Some towers feel utterly useless, for instance there is a slow-pad for the floor like a Killing Floor is used, it slows the enemies down alot but doesn't do damage, when the Killing Floor does damage and slows them down abit.  And some are useful for only certain types, for instance gattling guns are for ground units only, and missile launchers for air targets only, some of them are mixed though, so they hit both air and ground units.Longer waves mean harder enemies: When you upgrade all of your towers and weapons you would imagine you would be set, sadly that isn't true, as waves go on enemies get harder and harder with each wave, one time I had all of my towers (except 2-3) and all of my weapons upgraded and I was expecting to wipe the floor with everyone, but halfway through the wave the enemies were getting past my maze pretty quickly, and still had chunks of health left so I had to go back to the core and pick them off one by one, I lost sadly.  I would recommend you play with friends that way you can all gang up on the aliens.WHAT I THINK:  I think this was the actual good game of the 2, even half of my friends who played the 1st and 2nd prefer the 1st one instead, I still play this game on occassion because it's still entertaining to me, and I love it for that, it has quite high replayability, and the text-to-voice chat system is just downright hilarious, I give this game a 8/10, it needs some fixing with some things but it's still very fun all around.  Worth it on a sale or as it sits!			",379,41,2,15,16,2,13

												It fits into the tower defense cateogry but with a difference, you can get into the action yourself. And even with a friend.There are several maps and it is good fun trying to devise routes and killing fields for the enemy to walkthrough. If you are bored of tower defense games then you should try this, for it is completely different.The developers are updating it all the time with new features and maps.			",196,16,2,22,27,2,51

												An FPS Tower Defense Game - not 100% original, however this one pulled it off really well.  It took me about 4.5 hours to beat the single player set of 6 levels or so.  Some of the levels have 30 waves and can take an hour or two.This follows the same basic concept as a normal tower defense game.  You survive waves of attacks and you get points.  You use the points for new turrets or upgrades to the old ones.  The twist is that you can also upgrade your guns so you can help destroy the enemys in FPS fashion as they run through the tower defense path.I did find the game really easy once I placed Scatter Laser everywhere and kept upgrading my shotgun/sniper rifle.  The first two levels learning the game gave me more trouble than the last three levels by the time I figured it out.  On normal I got 100% on the last three levels.Anyways, totally cool if you love Tower Defense... don't buy if you love FPS because it is more of a tower defense than FPS.			",269,29,3,16,5,0,14

												Now this game feels fresh! Sanctum is a First Person Shooter Tower Defense game! It's very simple and for that I love it! You play as  a character who has to protect a core from marching aliens. You dont have a health bar you simply protect the core, which is much more diffcult than it seems! The music is also really nice and calm- ambient even!  The game even leaves little surprised in it's levels for you if you're feeling daring! Sanctum is a great game for a quick play or hours at a time. Playing with friends is also a plus! So much so that I bought copies for my pals which was just tops! ^^The only cons that I can think of is that there is no real story mode. There is a unique world here but no real story. You have to let your imagination create a story for you which doesn't tickle everyones pickle I suppose.			",260,111,6,42,15,3,22

												Sanctum is an awesome game that mashes the First-person shooter and Tower Defense. It's sound track is also quite unique and satisfying. I would personally rate this game a 9/10. The reason why I wouldn't rate it a 10/10 is because I can fore-see it getting repetive after hour seventy-ish. This is a great game if you like FPS's and Tower Defense games.

												Coffee Stain Studios originally sold me a half-finished game for $15. When they promised on their forum to add new content to the game, they failed to tell their customers that it would be a la carte (DLC) - all for an additional $11. I, along with others, was enraged by this and decided to stop playing altogether. A few months later, however, I changed my mind after a recent 75% off Steam sale. I decided that paying an additional $2 for the completed game seemed reasonable. These recent improvements have indeed made Sanctum more challenging and enjoyable. Therefore, I humbly (yet grudgingly) give CSS a tip of the hat for making a good game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great combination of thinking and shooting. I had not personally seen a game like Sanctum before. I had played a tower defense game before, particularly on Android mobile, but this was the first that blended tower defense and FPS genres. Multiplayer shows the attitude difference between players who just want to shoot aliens and take all the glory versus players that want to build the optimal defense maze and let the machines do most of the work. The map artwork is visually wonderful and map design is suitably puzzling in the possibilities and limitations of maze layout. Finding the easter eggs in each level is kinda fun too.Very much recommended, at least for the awesome cackling female laugh of the main character.			",32,0,0,5,1,0,1

												This along with its sequel (Sanctum 2) are my 2 favorite tower defense / fps shooter combo games.  Buy em both and you will thank me.  Smooth and fantastic gameplay, very intuitive controls both for the fps portion and the tower placement portions.  Many levels available...But when are they gonna put those dlc levels on sale!??!  Great game.StickyHamster of twitch.tv/stickyhamster ",534,131,21,81,71,4,88

												I didn't enjoy this game one bit. The towers are horribly balanced, and the best strategy on every level is to max out all your guns and then back-pedal through your maze while shooting at enemies, cycling guns as they overheat. Only build towers at all once you've run out of gun upgrades. Not well-designed or well-balanced at all.			",44,5,0,4,0,0,5

												To all of my friends i have met in DD, i have started to play a game that is also a defence game called Sanctum. This game is like DD but u dont get killed, instead of having a crystal or multyple crystals, u have one Core in which u defend. This game is also for like 1st person shooter, unlike DD which u run around with swords and stuff. You also have more of a veriety of monsters and towers. I will add to this recommendation when i get futher in to this game.			",27,2,0,4,0,0,0

												An FPS that can be played in single player, but honestly is much more fun with friends, the more the better.

												I recommend this game to anyone who is interested on playing this game.The combination of both a First-Person Shooter and a Tower defense gives both a significant amount of skill and strategy.

												Its an ego shooter, NO its a tower defense... What about merging both genres together? Sanctum manages to combine them in a motivating and rewarding way. One player might prefer building up mazes to perfection, using blocks, holofields, slowfields and towers of different kinds. Another player might want to rely on their weapon arsenal, using the shotgun, sniper rifle, assault gun, freezer or an interesting rocket launcher called REX. Then again, players can choose to use everything to their availability, weapons and towers, at the same time. The possibilities are therefore quite astounding and the difficulty is balanced out almost flawlessly, which is extremely important for a game of a TD kind. Sanctums strongest aspect is the multiplayer, because on higher difficulties you won't be able to survive without managing finances and priorities of each participant.It is rather short with 6 official levels, but a great deal for 10 bucks.

The maps have some terrain to explore offering a few nice easter eggs. The towers and guns are not too many but enough to make many buildups for different strategies. The playing modes are fun and the difficult is quite high, offering a real challange. The game and its dlc packs are worth the price, as well as the other two sanctum games.			",28,7,0,1,1,0,12

												Game is fun for the most part but has some balancing issues, has less than 100 people who play on Steam. Skip this game and try a similar tower defense game ""All orcs must die!"" which is pretty balanced, has variety and steamworkshop. If you prefer this developer check out reviews for Sanctum 2 (2013).			",135,15,1,20,8,2,30

												Absolutely fantastic concept for a game - a first person shooter tower defence. I am a fan of both genres even though my skill at both are apalling.The concept is great, however the game itself appears to try too hard in some aspects - I like to think I have an above-average quality gaming laptop but sanctum is considerably laggy and almost impossible to kill things in.Yes, it's a fantastic game - but I may not be the best person to ask of an opinion for as I suck at these sorts of games and the lag does not help - if you have a good PC, and if you like these genres then you definitely should try it out.

(mostly tower defense though)A group of up to 4 players, share resources, design a maze and decide on turret placement together, and you fight off waves of increasingly difficult monsters attempting to destroy your ""core"". The weapons, towers, physics, and overall game play have a pretty awesome feel to them. For the most enjoyment, play with friends.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sanctum is a great success of the combining of two genres. So many games try to meld or blur genres and what comes out is a diluted mess of a game. Sanctum is a tower defense game, but when the hoards come you spend your time helping defend the core by sniping air units or slowing down the line of charging bad guys. Both parts of the game are equally important as the towers or your guns won't be enough to beat a level by themselves. There are only 4 maps but each has an endless mode and coop is satisfying, helping the overall replay value. Do yourself a favor and pick this one up.			",645,134,16,68,39,6,77

												I'm not sure why, but Sanctum seems to consistently be relegated to the domain of 'novelty' in most of the material I've seen covering it: from reviews to recommendations, even its own advertisements, this game seems to focus more on the fact that You Can Use Guns than it does on the fact that it's an interesting, deep, challenging Tower Defence with good mechanics and a strong personality.  Even more, the fact that you get guns doesn't really detract from the sheer fun of the Maze-Build-Upgrade gameplay that is at the heart of the genre.  Now, this one is fairly solid-- it has a mazing apparatus built into it, out of which you form your other towers, meaning no space is wasted with powerless towers-- but I wish there was slightly less focus on the gunning aspect of it.  Like I said earlier, the game fixates on this fact, and instead of allowing you to opt-out of firing alongside your towers, several waves in every attempt consist entirely of enemies you must kill yourself.

												A fresh new type of game genre, Sanctum allows for new tower defense style while keeping it fresh. The multiplayer option is a great way to enjoy this game as you can upgrade your friends towers as well! It may not seem like much at all but playing this game is a ""blast!""			",42,6,0,4,2,0,2

												NOT WHAT I EXPECTED... ONE OF THE BEST GAMES IVE PLAYED THIS YEAR. Sanctum is... well... exactly what it says it is, Its a masterful mix of FPS and Tower Defense. you simply place your turrets then Help them to kill the enemies before they reach the core, once the core is at 0% then you loose, very simple but with the variety of enemies you need to be equiped for every situation, whether its hording Violator Drones to kill Spores or amassing an army of Gatling Guns to kill a mob of Walkers. 10/10 would play one million times again.

												Tower defence games typically boil down to a ""fire and forget"" strategy - place (sometimes, upgrade) your towers, then move on. FPSs strategy doesn't go beyond the immediate few seconds into the future. Yet, Sanctum takes these two drastically different genres and blends them together, covering or even elminating the drawbacks of each.In the build phase, you plan long-term strategy. What do I build? How do I counter the upcoming enemies? Do I build, or upgrade? Then during the combat phase, you focus on typical FPS aspects: Run, jump, strafe, shoot etc.The cherry on top is that these things play off each other. You can build towers just to do damage, or you can build them to give yourself an easier time with your gun by slowing enemies or amplifying damage. Or, you can slow or even stun enemies adjacent to high-damage towers to squeeze more out of them. Path layout is critical, yet many strategies exist. All in all, if you want an FPS that makes you think, this is one.			",94,15,0,20,15,0,13

												Sanctum.This game is seriously fun when its you and your friends battling it out against hordes of enemys. Actually, you dont even need friends for it to be fun, you can just join a game and its still a good experience. This game is great, challenging, gorgeous and most of all, a huge waste of time - BUT WHO CARES ITS AWESOME. there is no leveling feature for playing the game excesivly, but that can be forgived, as this game excells in almost all other categories. There are a good selection of unique weapons and an even greater selection of towers. the animations are still good however the killing of the enemys is a bit rediculous, they either drop dead or explode; its pretty funny though. I deffinetly reccomend to every person on this planet this game, as many hours of fun can be milked from it.Have fun, and remeber to always use the sniper - its too good. C;			",107,10,3,10,11,0,14

												A punishing, ruthless game with a steep learning curve. If that isn't your cup of tea, forget it. Sanctum mixes tower defense and first person shooting incredibly well, but demands creativity and planning. It should entertain you for a few hours, after which the repetitive nature of the genre and high difficulty might put you off.			",223,41,1,23,12,2,39

												Amazing game! This TD and FPS combo makes for a great co-op game with friends. The DIY maze system and unique tower types really make for diverse gameplay. I didn't find myself getting bored of this game even after a long night of mob killing. Like any TD game, it gets nearly impossible as you progress the levels but its always fun to mix and match playstyles to see how far you can really get. I give Coffee Stain Studios a thumbs up for a truly original game. Glad to see the indie community has some innovative ideas to keep evolving the industry.			",29,1,0,0,1,0,0

												An interesting mix of First Person Shooter and Tower Defence. Overall it is a fun game in a unique style and I enjoyed playing through it. Probably the most annoying part is getting half way through a mission and realising that you should have chosen a certain type of tower or personal weapon and have to start the level over again from the beginning. This is annoying as each level can take several hours.3/5			",63,37,0,16,12,0,40

Its games like this that make your games library feel ""fuller"".  to run at high graphics settings you are going to need a nice mid to high end gaming machine, and get some quality sound equip too because this has a great soundtrack.this works really well as a co-op multiplayer game as well as chilling out by ureself.7.5 outa 10 on a whole, but its really worth more then that to have in a gaming collection. buy it because you need it there to play when u need to unwind after too much big name titles.

The graphics is well made and the design is awesome. The landscapes are beautiful and the elien models are unique and interesting. The maps have some terrain to explore offering a few nice easter eggs. The towers and guns are not too many but enough to make many buildups for different strategies. The playing modes are fun and the difficult is quite high, offering a real challange. The game and its dlc packs are worth the price, as well as the other two sanctum games.			",28,7,0,1,1,0,12

It's pretty fun, until you play Co-Op with some friends, then it becomes really fun.Dungeon Defenders is better in my opinions, but this is truer to the tower defense genre in that you set up your towers and create a path/maze for the enemies to go through.Good game overall.

												Its an ego shooter, NO its a tower defense... What about merging both genres together? Sanctum manages to combine them in a motivating and rewarding way. One player might prefer building up mazes to perfection, using blocks, holofields, slowfields and towers of different kinds. Another player might want to rely on their weapon arsenal, using the shotgun, sniper rifle, assault gun, freezer or an interesting rocket launcher called REX. Then again, players can choose to use everything to their availability, weapons and towers, at the same time. The possibilities are therefore quite astounding and the difficulty is balanced out almost flawlessly, which is extremely important for a game of a TD kind. Sanctums strongest aspect is the multiplayer, because on higher difficulties you won't be able to survive without managing finances and priorities of each participant.It is rather short with 6 official levels, but a great deal for 10 bucks.

												Sanctum is good tower defence game in the first person. it pulls it off pretty well but tower defence never really works in first person and the gunplay is pretty rubbish. But it is a good indie game with good strategy and nice graphics. 7/10			",139,11,3,19,12,0,5

												I didn't enjoy this game one bit. The towers are horribly balanced, and the best strategy on every level is to max out all your guns and then back-pedal through your maze while shooting at enemies, cycling guns as they overheat. Only build towers at all once you've run out of gun upgrades. Not well-designed or well-balanced at all.			",44,5,0,4,0,0,5

												NOT WHAT I EXPECTED... ONE OF THE BEST GAMES IVE PLAYED THIS YEAR. Sanctum is... well... exactly what it says it is, Its a masterful mix of FPS and Tower Defense. you simply place your turrets then Help them to kill the enemies before they reach the core, once the core is at 0% then you loose, very simple but with the variety of enemies you need to be equiped for every situation, whether its hording Violator Drones to kill Spores or amassing an army of Gatling Guns to kill a mob of Walkers. 10/10 would play one million times again.

												There's tower defense games and then there is Sanctum's version of tower defense. It is supremely better in that it combines the tower building and defense with a first person shooter experience. Even though the baddies mostly travel in straight lines, making it feel not too exciting, it still is. Like all games like this, it can get to be overwhelming and quite annoying. The game looks and feels good and has pretty good co-op options avaliable. I would most definitely recommend it. ",370,49,25,33,29,0,41

												Tower defence games typically boil down to a ""fire and forget"" strategy - place (sometimes, upgrade) your towers, then move on. FPSs strategy doesn't go beyond the immediate few seconds into the future. Yet, Sanctum takes these two drastically different genres and blends them together, covering or even elminating the drawbacks of each.In the build phase, you plan long-term strategy. What do I build? How do I counter the upcoming enemies? Do I build, or upgrade? Then during the combat phase, you focus on typical FPS aspects: Run, jump, strafe, shoot etc.The cherry on top is that these things play off each other. You can build towers just to do damage, or you can build them to give yourself an easier time with your gun by slowing enemies or amplifying damage. Or, you can slow or even stun enemies adjacent to high-damage towers to squeeze more out of them. Path layout is critical, yet many strategies exist. All in all, if you want an FPS that makes you think, this is one.			",94,15,0,20,15,0,13

												Sanctum is a competent tower defence game combined with a fun FPS aspect. This combination, although it may sound strange, works like a charm. There is nothing more satisfying in this game than setting up an impressive defense which obliterates all foes, and destroying anything left with a huge plast from your Rex.An arsenal of weapons and tower choices makes this game diverse, and even more fun to play with friends to gt the best combination possible.A very solid game, and an excellent multiplayer experience make this a joy to play.

												Sanctum is a perfectly-dosed mix of FPS and tower defense. Graphical effects are very well designed. Choices between towers and their effects on different enemy types render the mechanics of the game very appealing. I played it in co-operation with friends, and we spent hours arguing about the paths and the towers to victory. A thrilling experience. FPS part is a nice addition, although strategy about tower placement and their upgrades is the main focus of Sanctum. We spent time to win every single map with 30 waves of opponents, and also bought the game's DLCs. Ergo, a must have to play with friends.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is one of those sleeper hits, where it gets released with little fanfare and attracts a small-but-loyal following.  I have to say, though, that where this game has gone since that time is quite amazing!  It started out as a very beautiful, atmospheric, strategic tower defense game and still has all of those elements, but Coffee Stain Studios has gone completely above and beyond in developing DLC content for it.  The newest update and DLC maps are so incredible and light-years ahead of the original game.  I started playing this game the day it was released and I recommended it to friends then - I definitely recommend it now!  There's an entire game within the game exploring the lush landscapes and basketloads of Easter eggs hidden in what is already a solid game.  Don't be an idiot, buy it!			",233,161,2,27,22,3,16

DID YOU EVER WISH TO BE ABLE TO SHOOT THE ENEMIES YOURSELF TOO?Well,with this game,you can.you are given a number of weapons which can be upgraded with the same money which is used to build towers.But more information later.Sanctum is a First Person Tower defense,where you build,upgrade your towers or weapons,stare at the dead multiplayer or play in single playerthere are different enemy types,for example,there are some which have a shield where you deal lower damage against,unless you shoot the weak spot enough.or enemies which fly.the controls(movement) are good,but it takes some time to get used to the game mechanics.So its recommended to see the tutorial.unless you already know first person TD gamesYou cannot die,you just get pushed back a whole bunch when you run into the enemies.make out of that what ever you want.Your weapons also do not require ammo,however,they can overheat,but you can us them after some seconds again,so do not worry.Do you recommend this?yes.a clear yes.its something i haven't seen before,with enemies i also already know(Super Sanctum TD since i played that one first)and the fact that you can shoot yourself in the game is also fun.if you aren't a fan of games like those where you can active shoot and do something while the wave happens,its nothing for you.maybe check it out on Youtube if you aren't sure,or just wait when this game is in sale.

												""Sanctum"" is...okay.The game's main interest lies in how it shows Coffee Stain's ability to iterate. The lessons that the team learned from ""Sanctum"" are very visible in ""Sanctum 2,"" a noticeably more polished title. This entry in the series is a decent diversion for a day or two, but it never gets beyond that.This is not to say that the original game is bad - it's just to point out that there are some very noticeable rough edges. In comparison to the sequel, the character handling in ""Sanctum"" feels clunky and imprecise. The tower building is much more of a chore, and just getting around the map feels a bit awkward.The game pacing is also ""clunky."" Each map lasts for what feels like an extraordinarily long time, without really building much tension to keep things interesting. This feeling of things being overlong also tends to create outsize punishments for choosing a bad tower loadout or overall strategy. If you chase yourself into a situation that suddenly becomes unwinnable at a late wave, the reaction is NOT one of ""Oh - I see what might work!"" Instead, my feeling was ""Ugh...I have to do all that again? *Sigh...*""Part of the problem is that the game is so contextless. I feel that it's a perfect example of a multiplayer game that just happens to have a working singleplayer mode. Unlike its sequel, ""Sanctum"" has no worldbuilding, characters, or sense of purpose that makes you invest in the game's progression. It's just a collection of disconnected encounters that happen to you, and while some of the defense problems are interesting to solve, there's a lot of repetition. It might be better with multiplayer co-op, where some of the social aspects serve to spice things up independent of the software.If the gameplay was truly a blast, the above wouldn't be as much of a liability. It doesn't make it to that point, though.So, with all the apparent negativity, why would I still click ""Yes"" when asked if I recommend ""Sanctum?""Well, first, reviewers need a third option: A ""Maybe"" button. But beyond that...I do feel that ""Sanctum"" is worth seeing as a curiosity. It provides a kind of window into how the series was formed and refined. Play time isn't everything, but in this case, I think there's a strong correlation. ""Sanctum 2"" was brilliant enough to keep me playing for almost 40 hours, which is more than four times longer than I was willing to spend with ""Sanctum."" It may be that ""Sanctum"" is only about 1/4 as good as its dramatically improved sequel. It certainly feels that way to me, and maybe that's just good enough to spend a few bucks on.In other words, the game is pretty ""Eh,"" but I don't hate it.			",116,11,0,16,5,0,15

												A great co-op game that lets you set up a variation of sentry guns in different formations to fend off waves of monsters covered in big glowing weak points. Very similar to Defence Grid but during waves you're firing at the enemies yourself too which I'd say is a bonus. Single player and multiplayer are pretty much the same thing with Sanctum so there are plenty of levels and challenges to get through together.			",415,93,14,34,16,5,54

												So I started playing Sanctum last time they had a free weekend (like a year ago?) I didn't buy it then, but I bought it now. I think this is my new favorite Tower Defense game. It happens to also be an FPS. So you walk around the map, laying down your towers of varying types (as in any TD game). Then when the action starts, not only do your towers start shooting, but so do you. So while your turrets are killing aliens, you're running and jumping and shooting them as well.At first I was like ""Meh. Whatever. I'll let my towers do all the work and just keep an eye on things and mop up any leaks."" Nope. You can't win at this game without a good tower strategy AND a good supplemental sniper rifle strategy.For example, there are certain enemies that are armored and take zero damage until a shot to the head makes them vulnerable for about ten seconds. Once in a while, a tower will get lucky. But most of the time you need to do that♥♥♥♥♥♥yourself.So I give Sanctum an A-.			",168,33,0,50,30,4,67

												Sanctum is probably one of the most fun I've had in a tower defense game. It mixes tower defense with a first person shooter, which really mixes up the combat. You have a huge variety of turrets and weapons. Each level starts off a blank slate and you choose where to place blocks, creating the enemy AI pathing. These blocks can be upgraded to any turret or platform you want. There is also this thing they call a transelevator (or something similiar) that you can use to either transport to another one on the map or use it to get ontop of that block and walk along the high blocks, perfect for when your shooting your own weapons, like the Assualt rifle, sniper rifle or the slow enemies down weaopon. Each gun has alternative fires/modes. I really recommend this game to people who are tired of ToD games or have never tried one before. It's a fresh change that I really liked.

												Coffee Stain Studios originally sold me a half-finished game for $15. When they promised on their forum to add new content to the game, they failed to tell their customers that it would be a la carte (DLC) - all for an additional $11. I, along with others, was enraged by this and decided to stop playing altogether. A few months later, however, I changed my mind after a recent 75% off Steam sale. I decided that paying an additional $2 for the completed game seemed reasonable. These recent improvements have indeed made Sanctum more challenging and enjoyable. Therefore, I humbly (yet grudgingly) give CSS a tip of the hat for making a good game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great combination of thinking and shooting. I had not personally seen a game like Sanctum before. I had played a tower defense game before, particularly on Android mobile, but this was the first that blended tower defense and FPS genres. Multiplayer shows the attitude difference between players who just want to shoot aliens and take all the glory versus players that want to build the optimal defense maze and let the machines do most of the work. The map artwork is visually wonderful and map design is suitably puzzling in the possibilities and limitations of maze layout. Finding the easter eggs in each level is kinda fun too.Very much recommended, at least for the awesome cackling female laugh of the main character.			",32,0,0,5,1,0,1

												Wonderful twist on the age-old game of tower defense. It is somewhat similar to Orcs Must Die!, but requires more thought and you actually need to aim before you fire.I like that you can start the attacks when you are ready and therefore you have time to think and set up your towers the way you want them.One thing that bothers me a bit is that the first waves of attacks are the most difficult and then the level becomes much easier. It should be the other way around.			",36,1,0,0,3,0,2

												This game is a decent game, some of the features are pretty cool, and the mixture of fps shooter and tower defense is mixed extremely well, but i dont like that there is no sense of danger. the creatures dont do any damage to you even though they could just trample you or scratch or anything really. Other than that this game is worth your money.			",95,20,0,11,23,0,25

												This game may be interesting for people who are hardcore into tower defense and/or the story of Sanctum.... but I found it infuriating and no fun.

												Sanctum is an interesting, unique, and addicting game.Simply put, it's a Tower Defense game combined with some elements of an FPS in a way that works really well. It has a wonderful sci-fi art style and everything in the game just about has an interesting design to it. It has some really calming music as you play that still fits the style perfectly, the gameplay itself is great, and offers plenty of challenge without being too extreme, it definitely has some of the best replay value of anything I've played in a long time. You can play it for hours at a time or just for a few minutes and enjoy it just as much. The only thing that may be seen negatively is the fact that it doesn't have a story to it, but for the type of game it is it really doesn't need one. It's truly underrated compared to Goat Simulator which the developers get plenty of attention for. 10/10 completely recommend.			",79,4,1,6,8,0,8

												My thoughts on this game.If you like to support your team from the back, This is a great game. Mind you, this isnt just a gamefor snipers and medics, it features many different guns, and towers, so you can easily adjust the towers to your playstyle.For me, and I have a 2 year old laptop running windows 7, ( Note: For some reason I can play Cod Black ops 2 on highest setting, but minecraft has a framerate of 24 at lowest setting)Anyway, It runs like a charm. I can advise this game for anyone out there who likes tower defense games and First person shooters, because this combines them. And I must say, they did a great job. Shove off with your ninja kiwi flash games! this is a game you will find superior. I cant stop playing it.And its the worlds first FPS TDM hybrid.Summary of all the gibberish above:Great game, Good for everyone from rushers to steamrollers, moderately large customization, works great on most computers (2 years old at the most?) and just a game I think alot of people will like!

												This is by far the most fun tower defense game I've played.  It gives you a lot of freedom, and has a nice twist of getting down and dirty with your towers with guns of your own to take on the horde.  The weapons are great, there's also a nice choice of towers to build.  The music is amazing and the levels are some of the most interesting and beautiful levels I've seen; the art design on this game is top notch.  Pick this game up with a friend, you won't be disappointed.			",276,36,11,23,11,0,30

												 Sanctum is a unique tower defense game with you being able to enter the maze and help defend your base while your towers also defend aswell. This game is unique in so many ways and I wish that I could play the sequel. The handful of maps this game contained were just grand. I loved playing this game and I recommend it to anybody who loves tower defense games. 9.42/10 Stars.			",74,5,0,3,6,0,4

												Sanctum is a first-person tower defense, where you can control what is built, where the monsters go, and how powerful your weapons are! You can even hook up with up to 3 friends and play a multiplayer round!Gameplay7/10-Good gameplay, you can place down towers and upgrade them to make them stronger, or upgrade your weapons to make you stronger! The main goal is to stop to many monsters from getting to your orb.Presentation 8/10-Really good graphics, however male players might get a bit mad, as they can only play as female. Your character for some reason has a robotic arm, which I never could figure out why.Enjoyment6/10-Good game to play when you have nothing else to do, but without some friends it isn't that great. The game is the exact same thing every level, except new enemies, and a new map.21/30 or 7/10Great game, but it can get a bit tedious, otherwise it's a great game. If the game isnt hard enough for you though, join some friends and you'll get even more enemies!			",261,59,3,48,27,0,37

												Amazing to play on lan with your friends.  It can get very intense when you are almost done with a level and the monsters have reached your orb thing and you are all fighting as hard as you can to stay alive.  Definitely more fun with friends that it is with random people or single player.			",60,3,0,5,4,0,7

												Liking tower defense games, but hating fps, i found this game incredibly amazing. IMO this edition of Sanctum is way better than the second one because this one doesn't have as many restrictions as the second one, which gives a wider number of strategies for clearing some levels, without focusing that much in the FPS side. But seriously, amazing game, so worth the price for the play time. 9.5/10			",85,13,3,12,9,0,9

												Fantastic.Sanctum combines the immersive gameplay of a first person shooter with the tactical style of tower-defence. As a fan of both of these genres, it was a no-brainer for me to purchase Sanctum and give it a go. Turns out it was one of the best purchases I've ever made through Steam and has become one of my favourite PC games to date. The game includes beautiful visuals on all settings, a mix of fun and tense gameplay, simple controls, easy to understand menus and HUD and even free DLC!If you're a fan of any of the above check it out, especially if it goes on sale! I'm at 25 hours now and continue to keep going.			",250,60,5,28,17,2,20

												Sanctum is a towerdefense game, where you instead of building defenses and then watching it unfold, you engage personally in a FPS style to support your towers or even take out special enemies that they have troubles with. You can choose between the waves if you want to build new defenses, upgrade your towers/weapons or even save the cash.The soundtrack is really awesome, the enemies look great and it is fun to play solo as in Multiplayer. =)Be sure to buy the Collection or even the 4 pack if you have friends would like this kind of game, since the basegame is in comparison really overpriced. :s			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is one of those sleeper hits, where it gets released with little fanfare and attracts a small-but-loyal following.  I have to say, though, that where this game has gone since that time is quite amazing!  It started out as a very beautiful, atmospheric, strategic tower defense game and still has all of those elements, but Coffee Stain Studios has gone completely above and beyond in developing DLC content for it.  The newest update and DLC maps are so incredible and light-years ahead of the original game.  I started playing this game the day it was released and I recommended it to friends then - I definitely recommend it now!  There's an entire game within the game exploring the lush landscapes and basketloads of Easter eggs hidden in what is already a solid game.  Don't be an idiot, buy it!			",233,161,2,27,22,3,16

												This is a fantastic blend of tower defense and FPS. It reminds me of Defense Grid (one of the best tower defense gmes of all time), only with 1st person coop!It's fantastic and very well done. You get to build blocks to shape the waves path, and ultimately decide where you want to build tawers, which ones should be upgraded for maximum damage, and even upgrade your weapons along with the towers. You can play a million different ways depending on the towers you choose, the weapons, and if you decide to ugrade the towers, or your weapons, or a combo of both. It's really a must have game if you like tower defense games, and if you like FPS and TD games, it should be a crime not to paly Sanctum.			",223,38,10,17,18,3,69

												If you like Tower Defense type games and you also enjoy a good FPS shooter where you do not have to worry about the cheating hacker killing you .... this game is for you. This game runs in the same vein as MvM in TF2 except the monsters do not shoot at you. I feel that this game is more fun than MvM as 1.) its much easier due to towers one can build to assist you in defense of the core and 2.) (MOre importantly) I do NOT have to keep paying to play it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The graphics are average but the fun factor is definitely there. This game also runs fine on lower end computers so the Wal-Mart specials out there can play it. This game is a nice break from the world of hackers that so commonly plague all Multi-player games now days.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Nice idea and actually like the game. There is just 1 small (and by small I mean big) problem. YOU CANT KILL ANYTHING! Almost every monster in the game has more health than damage you could do if if had all fully upgraded towers. Ill spend the whole round following 1 monster, shooting it and it will die just before the core, then the 5 others right behind it just walk right in. Even with all my towers.Unless there is something im missing its impossible to do it solo and VERY hard to do with 4 people.So.Pros.A cool concept where you can shoot from a FPS view while your towers kill things4 player multiplayerCons.Almost unkillable monsters lead to an almost impossible gameCrappy graphicsIt is fun its just annoying to get to wave 3 of 20 by the skin of your teeth and then fail horribly on wave 4			",93,8,0,7,6,0,6

												Sanctum surmounted to beign a scumbag dlc driven game that is semi tradtional TD setup with a hero element.  most of the useful weapons/tower types are dlc only and make other people feel utterly useless because of it.  i question if some achievments even work such as finding something in a ceartin place.  though sadly the game got old quick and a downvote for originality because of you doing a caremel dance when you win a level.

												Sanctum combines the generic first person shooter with tower defence and give a nice and welcomed twist to the gaming scene, it allows for you to go wild on upgrading your weapon to be the ultimate killing machine or go mad with power and build a endless row of towers to mince your foes to peices.the game is good fun but is limited with levels and is best played with friends, while you can play solo it is far less fun and you dont stand a chance in the harder difficulties.if you are into your first person shooters and wonder what it would be like to have a tower defence element thrown in, then id say go ahead and give this a shot, its some great fun but sadly lacks content making it a bit repetative at times. but its more than worth £10 or so.id say just give it a shot			",106,6,2,11,5,0,23

												There's tower defense games and then there is Sanctum's version of tower defense. It is supremely better in that it combines the tower building and defense with a first person shooter experience. Even though the baddies mostly travel in straight lines, making it feel not too exciting, it still is. Like all games like this, it can get to be overwhelming and quite annoying. The game looks and feels good and has pretty good co-op options avaliable. I would most definitely recommend it. ",370,49,25,33,29,0,41

												There was a time when tower defense games asked you to do one thing – set down defense structures in order to prevent waves of enemy units from destroying your base. All of this was done from a top-down view so that you could see the action without really being in the midst of it all.While there have been recent attempts to change up the genre, like Defenders of Ardania which allowed players to build their own armies, such games have stuck to the top-down perspective and not changed the formulaic gameplay. Other games like Plants vs Zombies, for example, fully embraced the old mechanics but were very successful because of their presentation. Yet only recently have games such as Dungeon Defenders changed the perspective.Sanctum offered me a first-person view of the tower defense action becoming the latest game to do so. No longer having to watch helplessly from the sky and pray that my strategically placed towers would fend off the enemy, I found myself able to take part in defending my base right in the thick of things.Read the rest of my review at Press2Reset: http://press2reset.com/reviews/review-sanctum-collection/ ",344,72,5,59,47,3,79

												Sci-fi FPS / Tower defence hybrid. Control how the enemies run by carving a path for them with blocks and defence systems. Release the wave and go shoot. Oh and you can't die.Graphics are slightly outdated, but not that bad either. Enemies are... weird, but lotsa difference in them. Multiplayer is fun.Not bad game, but you could also try sequal, Sanctum 2 or maybe Orcs must die! serie			",469,179,2,73,57,3,102

												Like all good tower defenses, it’s a game about juggling your resources. Maybe you can handle the baddies in the air and only build ground-attack towers? (Perhaps.) Maybe you can upgrade only your own weapons and take them all on by yourself? (Unlikely.) Or maybe you’ll spend the next hour re-trying different combinations until it’s suddenly dark outside and you should have been sleeping three hours ago. (Inevitable.)

												The marriage of tower defense and FPS never felt so right. With tight controls and excellent art direction, Sanctum delivers a pleasant mix of strategy and execution. Plan your defenses well and you can rest your trigger finger while watching your enemies helplessly march into the jaws of your death machine. Plan them poorly and it becomes a panic storm of overheating weapons and critical hits. Gameplay is forgiving to the beginner, but the higher difficulties reward tactics and design. Coffee Stain Studios have presented a brilliant proof of concept that tickles all the right parts of my brain. I can't wait for the sequel.			",23,3,0,2,0,0,1

												Now this game feels fresh! Sanctum is a First Person Shooter Tower Defense game! It's very simple and for that I love it! You play as  a character who has to protect a core from marching aliens. You dont have a health bar you simply protect the core, which is much more diffcult than it seems! The music is also really nice and calm- ambient even!  The game even leaves little surprised in it's levels for you if you're feeling daring! Sanctum is a great game for a quick play or hours at a time. Playing with friends is also a plus! So much so that I bought copies for my pals which was just tops! ^^The only cons that I can think of is that there is no real story mode. There is a unique world here but no real story. You have to let your imagination create a story for you which doesn't tickle everyones pickle I suppose.			",260,111,6,42,15,3,22

												Tower-defence + First-person shooter = pretty fun.When I first played this, I made the mistake of treating it like a first person shooter with light elements of tower-defence, and that was a mistake.  I got slaughtered.  I got annoyed.  I thought the game was at fault and I put it down for a long time.Earlier, today, though, I decided to pick it up again and I found a pleasant surprise: the game is actually pretty awesome.  If you strategize before the rounds and prepare properly, you can kick butt.  It's actually a tower-defence game with a light FPS element.  If you come at it from that perspective, you'll find it's good stuff.			",1436,652,19,217,104,9,143

												First person tower defense. Overall a good and a fun game. One of the best tower defense games I have played. It has two componets first person shooting and building towers. Have to make a choice between upgrading towers or weapons. Runs on Unreal 3 engine so its not very demanding. Has up to 4 player coop and number of gamemodes. If you are looking for a tower defense game. Try this one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was a little skeptical since I have never been huge into tower defense games but I do enjoy a good FPS from time to time. This game does an excelent job of merging the two. I was somewhat concerned with how the game was going to pull off object placement and interaction but it manages to pull it off with a wonderfully intuitive interface. Being able to jump into the battle also gives it an edge over other tower defense games.It could stand a few more maps, at present It has 5 maps. However I feel compelled to mention how detailed these maps seem to be, if one chooses to explore around to see what is hidden in them.My only regret so far is that I wish I had snagged the 4 pack.

												A tower defence game where you get to join in on the shooting FPS style. At first I was put off when I watched total biscuit play with the devs in one of his ""WTF is"" videos. Got the game on sale anyway to give it a go and it was much more fun than his video made it look. It might possibly be down to it being much more tense in single player than the 4-player mode he played, especially when you have to watch spawns at opposite ends of the map by yourself. If you like FPS's and Tower Defence games then this should be an enjoyable addition to your collection.			",503,127,10,72,29,3,58

												Sanctum is Tower Defense taken to a new level. The FPS aspect fits the game so well, it's a wonder something like it hasn't been attempted before. It's a damn shame that all the DLC is extra. I'd like to have the extra towers and the extra levels without having to dish out extra money. That aside, however, the game is great fun even without the DLC.			",90,22,0,13,6,1,8

												""I originally found out about Sanctum about a year ago, before it was avaliable on steam for pre-order. A friend had told me about it and it was a mod for Unreal Tournament III. I tried it out and liked it, but being a small buggy mod I hoped they would develop it a little more. Then I found it on steam a few days ago and pre-ordered it. Playing the beta has been brilliant. They have added many new features, refined it and made it even funner to play. For a first person wave defense game, it is very well thought through and enjoyable to play. I havent even played the full version cause it isnt out yet! 5/5""			",212,10,4,17,7,1,8

												I have to say, i really like this game, something about the cross between fps and tower defense creates an incredibly fun game, it takes getting used to, and can be difficult at first, but once you get used to creating mazes, knowing where to put towers, what towers you need, AS WELL as concentrating on upgrading your own weapons, things get really fun. The gameplay is pretty indepth, choosable loadouts for weapons and towers, of which there are a large variety in both areas. To be honest though, the the thing i love most about this game is the asthetics and music, it creates a kind of serene, sci-fi atmosphere that i just love.The continued development on this game means more and more content will hopefully keep coming, i would totally reccomend this game.

												One of the better tower defense games out there with the potential to be even better. Additional DLC is worth getting and adds more value to the game.			",199,23,2,19,13,2,25

												I did not think I would like this game but It was 90% off and now I am playing it for over an hour everyday. When ever you are not building you are fighting and there is never a dull moment in this game. I highly recomend this game to whoever like tower defense and FPS games. The mechanics are easy and everything looks really good as well.			",45,2,1,2,6,0,1

												Great combination of thinking and shooting. I had not personally seen a game like Sanctum before. I had played a tower defense game before, particularly on Android mobile, but this was the first that blended tower defense and FPS genres. Multiplayer shows the attitude difference between players who just want to shoot aliens and take all the glory versus players that want to build the optimal defense maze and let the machines do most of the work. The map artwork is visually wonderful and map design is suitably puzzling in the possibilities and limitations of maze layout. Finding the easter eggs in each level is kinda fun too.Very much recommended, at least for the awesome cackling female laugh of the main character.			",32,0,0,5,1,0,1
