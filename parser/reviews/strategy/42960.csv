												A deep and sophisticated grand strategy/gommunism simulator from Paradox Interactive, Victoria II poses several fascinating questions, such as:""Why is Britain such a lazy doucһebag?""""How can I have 6 million rebels every year when I have a population of 5 million?""""Why does Fascist Tibet have a better economy than me?""""How is Fascist Tibet even possible?""""Why is everyone leaving my country?""Britain, help, Tibet is invading me!""""How is that a game over?""In addition to creating endless possibilities for such believable worlds, Victoria II features a robust and realistic world economy that's too complex for any mere mortal to comprehend. Constantly bail out bankrupt factories and watch your country spiral into debt, just like real life! The political aspect of the game is also breathtakingly realistic. Watch as your pops do the exact opposite of what you want them to, always be upset with your decisions, and rebel at the worst possible time. A basic guide to politics is that just like in the real world, communism is always the answer. With it, the only one you have to blame for your fuϲkups is yourself, not incompetent AI.Diplomacy is an important part of the game, especially alliances. If a country is even slightly favorable towards a great power, you can expect them to always intervene against you, ruling out any conflict with that country. Your own allies will constantly call on you for aid, but won't have any problems with leaving you on your own when you need help. There's also the great infamy system, which supposedly prevents blobbing but really just creates artificial difficulty.The game might seem way too complex at first, but after an hour or 50 you'll see that it's just as complex as you thought it was, but at least you sort of understand it now. If you stick with it long enough to git gud, the game will be a lot of fun.Overall: 10/10, it's decentP.S. Expect to have fun with massive yearly Jacobin rebellions in the latter half of the game unless if you're the USA or Gutter Germany. Although, if you're Gutter Germany, you should probably just kill yourself.P.P.S. I forgot to mention the many amazing mods there are for this game, including the infamous Pop Demand Mod, which adds great features such as three different kinds of shoe factories, the amazing-and-totally-not-broken Victoria Ultimate which tries to apply 19th century politics and economics to 400 years of history, and vickymod, letting you experience all the epic reddit memes you can fit in your fedora.

												You can play as communist Texas. 10/10.But seriously:Victoria II isn't the prettiest grand strategy game that's ever come around. The economic system in particular requires about seven PhDs and consultation with the Elder Gods to understand, and sometimes it feels like you don't really have any control over the politics of your country beyond slight nudges. Some would argue that's the entire point, but I digress.Where Victoria II will grab you, and hold you, is the sheer diplomacy system. Whereas in EU4 one country will simply superblob, Vicky has a very nice system of balance. Countries rarely blob, and even when they do, they're only one catastrophic war away from being knocked down to size. And just like other Paradox games, Victoria II is incredibly easy to mod. Don't like your flag? Change it! Want to rename a political party? Change it! Feel like modifying a few provinces to balance out the economy? All that's needed is a few corrections in a text file. PROS:- Combat feels the most balanced of any Paradox game. Even Art of War.- Politics system will always have you coming back for more- Incredible attention to detail. Every country has its own republican, monarchist, fascist, and communist flag.- Great power mechanic makes it actually feel like you're actually playing as one state among many, instead of just one human vs the same computer wearing different hatsCONS:- Economy system is an absolute mess. - Since Heart of Darkness, sieges take far, far too long. FINAL VERDICT:First off, I do NOT recommend this to anyone but gamers who have a grand strategy game or two under their belt. Anyone else is just going to take one look at the industrial and demographics screen and uninstall the game. But for those who learn its mechanics, Victoria II will pay back in dividends.

												I begin with the United Kingdom, quickly releasing all nations that it holds such as that of Australia, Canada, Ireland... Ireland...This shall be my empire, this shall be where I forge my glorious ideals of a world wide state, dominated by guiness and whiskey. I began expanding, I was making a lot of money, so much infact that I had begun taking over the world's market, despite the fact I was only a small nation. I needed raw materials, Ireland as an island, was not quite enough. My military slowly grew, soldier after soldier poured out of the gates of the Dublin Military Academy. I tried begging France to join me on my righteous crusade. I built boats as to carry my army, now I shall leave the greatest cities of Asia but smouldering piles of rock and ash. I landed in Johore, a small country in the Malay area. The many armies, 1st of Cork, 3rd of Derry, all fought hard in the jungle and despite disease and famine pulled through, it was now mine, it was now Ireland's. I begun developing this hell-hole into a place where an Irishman could hop off the steamboat and expect a pint waiting for him by the beach. Sadly, the Ottoman Empire decided we were getting too big for ourselves, too cocky. They landed in Galloway, forcing up to Dublin through the few troops that were left behind after the conquest of General O'Doherty in Asia. I quickly negotiated peace, they demanded we disarm, we had little option. I began to rebuild the country, look to other places for inspiration. Maybe Africa? What about Western America? As I gazed off into the sea from my cosy office in Dublin I got news of Portugal declaring war? What for? I haven't got the slightest idea. And then again, Britain had now declared war on me! What was I to do? My navy was still half way around the world attempting to frantically sail back to the homeland, disbanding the colony in Johore dismantling that pub that had become so popular with the plantation owners. The British army quickly crossed from Wales and Belgium, my closest ally at the time, refused to aid me in my most finest hour. I quickly negotiated peace with Britain once again, however Portugal was more stubborn. By calling my peasants to arms I managed to fend off the assault from Lisbon and just as the troops were recovering, awaiting supplies and reinforcements from Asia, the Netherlands declared war. I once again quickly negotiated with Portugal to face my new oponent, the sky was looking dark for Ireland and her dreams of imperialism. The Dutch landed in Derry, I couldn't fend them off, all other nations had put me under mandatory disarmament - I couldn't call any more units to arms, it was a disaster! The Netherlands thankfully backed off, supposedly seeing some dim light in my attempts of peace. Now under four consecutive disarmament orders and being passed pillar-to-post by nations like a puppet state, Ireland sits thoughtfully on the side of Britain - its empire decimated, its people sat in sadness and its cities burning from the cannons of Europe. Not much to do now but bide our time in hopes of another oppurtunity...one day...Such is the life of a potato farmer with big dreams.			",69,3,1,7,11,0,13

												This is my absolute favorite game of all time and my longest played game ever with 712 hours on steam + 100+ hours on other computers. And I'm here today to tell you why you should invest your money into buying this beautiful pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ even at full price.  Note: This review is played with all the expansions ""Heart Of Darkness"" and ""A House Divided"", these expansions are absolutely  NECESSARY to get the fully enjoyable Victoria II experience (But don't get the rest of the DLC, waste of money)  For starters, this game is not for the casual player, far off. This game is a part of the very small and obscure genre of Grand Strategy video games which is made by the Swedish Developers of Paradox, but the genre is slowly growing. Grand Strategy games are very much focused on portraying a grander scale of the already existing genre of strategy (for example 4x Civilization), But with this grander scale also comes hard to learn controls, mechanics and A LOT of trial & error if you don't like watching spoonfeeding guides. And adding insult to injury, this is also the most complicated Grand Startegy game of them all, compared to games like Crusader Kings & Europa Universalis. But if you are willing to play a game for several hours just how to learn to play it, watch tutorial videos and get repeatedly ravaged by the AI, proceed reading this review.  A simple rundown of the game: Victoria II is a game about country/empire managing where you play any country  during the time period from 1836 to 1936. You control the economics, build industry, watch your population grow and wage war with the goal of being a dominant power in the world. Let's start with the content. Put simply: It's endless. You want a game which takes up to 30+ hours just to finish one campaign, and then restart a new one with another of the 200+ playable countries within the game? (Even more if you add mods like HPM, GSG & NNM) There's no goal in the game except surviving from 1836 to 1936, other then that, you set up your own goals . Want to conquer the entirety of Africa as Egypt? Do that. Want slavery to survive and prosper in North America? Do that. Want to turn uncivilized ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s into empires and great powers? Do that. Want to be the dominant world police as Canada? Dude, do that.  It's all up to you. What I also like with the game is that every country in it's own right is unique and feels different, some less and some more. Great powers contain a lot of flavor and will offer a lot of historical facts, trivia, decisions and events that will both hinder and help you. Some nations lack in these areas, but is easily fixable by mods out there. The most important mechanic in this game, which is ultimately the extremely unique population system. Every nation (and uncolonized land) have it's dedicated population at the start of the game, and it will day for day to the end of the game grow. This is the most addicting mechanic of the game, trying to make your nation prosper in the best way possible. POP's has they are called, pretty much defines everything in the game. They pay the taxes you need, produce the goods your selling and buying, work in the industry you build and the most important one, they are the soldiers in your army. If every soldier die in one of your divisions, that division dies off with them. There are no imaginary soldiers that appears from nowhere and refills your army here like in CKII & EUIV, Every pop in the game counts, and every death is a casualty for your nation. The graphics in the game is very simple and really is just a giant map of the world. But considering what kind of game it is, it does the work and even in my opinion, very charming. While the game always start you out in terrain mode, I suggest you always play in Political Mode, which colors every nation in it's unique color.  The game offers many ways to see the game with different kind of modes in the map veiwer. From looking where population density is highest in your country to where you can currently colonize in the world. Mods exist to further improve the graphics with better huds, bloom and textures. The soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal, with amazing orchestral victorian music which sets up the mood and atmosphere to wage war against your enemies. Even if you are not going to buy the game, you should do yourself a favor and listen to the soundtrack of this game:

And for those who enjoy modding and playing with mods, this is the game for you! I can safely say that this is one of the most easily moddable games out there. Even I during my free time have created custom countries and events for the game. So if you want to spice up the experience, make your own country and scenario! But if you are to lazy to do that, do not worry. Victoria II's mod community is huge and surprisingly keeps this old obscure game alive even to this day.Want more nations for your game?

Make your own or play the amazing mods that people make even to this dayAnd that wraps up my review. Put simply, I ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ love this game and if you like what you are reading, you should consider buying the Victoria Collection right now, or wait until the game hits a sale.10/10 would play again			",120,27,1,12,11,0,17

												This game really taught me a lot about history. Like that one time in 1897 when the Germans invaded Lithuania and the Australians helped the Lithuanians from their colony in south-eastern Romania, only for some Mexicans to invade the mainland without the Australians noticing, but thankfully the Zulus were able to rout the Mexicans and save the Australian Capital. Truly a masterpiece			",43,3,0,14,16,0,23

												I started playing as the United States, because freedom. After clicking around the interface, I realize that I can release the Cherokee as a nation. That sounded cool so I did it. So right there I had a lifelong ally that always had my back. Not bad. 	A very successful war with Mexico later, the United States looks much like it does today, stretching from sea to shining sea. My economy is kickass, and I have been using my national focuses (Foci?) to make my upper house more liberal, so I have some half-decent safety regulations and retirement pensions going. I’m all set to become a prosperous and peaceful nation minding it’s own business for the rest of the game. However, I realize that the UK really hates me for a variety of reasons this is bad news because my military is basically a joke. I simply don’t have the manpower to field a force capable of turning back a hypothetical invasion by the UK. Hey, China has like TONS of manpower, right? Plus they aren’t Westernized and they are currently suffering some pretty intense civil unrest. If I were to say, step in and “secure” a piece of China, well then I could “protect” it’s many citizens from the horrors of a civil war and if some grateful Chinese people should happen to join the United States military… well then everyone wins.60 years have passed since I decided to declare war on China over a small coastal province. I now own Manchuria, Mongolia, parts of Japan and almost all of China. The war with the UK never happened. I am now the greatest power in the world by a wide margin. What started as an attempt to play as a peaceful and prosperous America ended with me sitting on most of Asia and fighting of numerous wars of “containment” launched by jealous European powers. Peace is boring. ",18,10,0,7,13,0,20

												This is one of my favorite strategy games of all time. It is fun and addictive and is a very historically accurate game (if you find games like Risk and Civ V long, I don't recommend it). Unlike other Paradox games, however, this one focuses a lot on internal improvements instead of war (thanks to the extra-restrictive infamy system). All land not available for colonization in the EU series is colonizable here. This makes for an even better game if you convert from CKII to EUIV to V2 as you get a near full historical timeline for one country. It is always interesting to see how the scramble for Africa plays out in each game (especially if you're involved in it). This game also characterizes the time period very accurately. It is full of many interlocking alliances/spheres with smaller countries along with great power intervention. The crisis system also demonstrates how many near-wars occured during this time over foreign affairs, but were solved through dipolmacy. You have the great powers oppressing the rest of the world taking over land from Asian and African nations for resources and strategic positions, as well. Also, the industrialization process makes up for the lack of war. However, this game does have some flaws. The infamy system restricts expansion greatly which is not exactly accurate to history. Perhaps if infamy was only gained when waging war against great powers or secondary powers. It really shouldn't cost 22 infamy to annex Haiti, Cuba, or other lesser civs. Also, there shouldn't be infamy for LIBERATING a county, something usually regarded as a moral action. Things like the Spanish-American war can't occur due to large infamy gains. Also, the in game tutorials are awful and teach you very little. It will take a long time to learn. Another thing is that, don't be fooled, unlike most other Paradox games, there are only two start dates. There is no full range of date choice. While this seems really stupid at first, it does make sense as if you could just start the game at any date, you will miss the whole industrialization process which is one of the main features of the game. Despite these flaws, this game is great. If you put the time in to learn it, you will love it.*This review is for the full game with Heart of Darkness expansion			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When I first started playing this game, I thought it was incredibly boring and that it will take hours to finish in one campaign.After playing couple of hours, I started to get into it and it took me into an amazing journey with couple of countries.GAMEPLAY:Victoria II provides you with a great and simple UI that you will easily remember. It's looks beautiful and simple though some things should have been put into the top bar to make it quickly accessible but with DLCs such as A House Divided it will fix it. The game starts at 1836. You get a wide range of countries you can play as. It took me a while to choose which country I should go as and after a while I picked Prussia. Diplomacy is quite important in the game because if you don't have any allies and you start a war, multiple Great Powers might take the chance and annex you. You have a couple of categories in your top bar such as Budget, Diplomacy, Research, Population, Military, Production etc. You're gonna have a lot of fun improving your country's production, doing some research and seeing your country go up on the list of top countries and even one day, becoming a Great Power. Being in war is enjoyable, not like in some games, it can take a lot of years for countries such as Germany vs. France (it took me up to 15 years once) but it still makes you wanna write down the big battles of 100k soldiers dying for your country and your dictatorship. Winning wars, annexing countries, taking their regions, humiliatin etc. is so satisfying that you'll feel great! When I humiliated France and took most of their regions in 50-60 years, it felt amazing. When the game ends, 1935., you might feel sad if you didn't complete your goals but ofcourse Hearts of Iron III is there for you.MULTIPLAYER:Multiplayer felt dissapointing when you couldn't connect to any server and play with your friends. After some time I found out that you must use Hamachi or Tunngle to play with your friends which was rather dumb. I tried the multiplayer with my friends and I enjoyed a lot. Having you and your friends plan for massive Great Wars against your enemies is awesome.THE VERDICT:Victoria II will take you to an amazing journey that will last dozens of hours and even hundreds of hours. You will enjoy the amount of countries and possibilities, you won't be able to Quit the game. Having no servers for multiplayer was dissapointing but programs as Hamachi and Tunngle will fix it. After playing for some time, you WILL want the DLCs and they won't dissapoint you, they're not like CoD or BF DLCs, they will give you a wide range of NEW possiblities and scenarios.GOOD:+ User Interface+ Possibilities+ Addictive+ Long Campaign+ DLCs+ Fun MultiplayerBAD:- Having to use Third-Party software to make MP playableOVERALL:9/10			",185,29,6,16,13,3,21

And most countries have flavour events+ Westernization is great--- Learning curve kills players-- Trading system I still dont get after about 100 hoursAlso note: You need to have played at least 2 or more Grand Strategy titles before playing this (total war does not count.)

												You'll be hard pressed to find a better (let alone any other) game set during histories most exiting period. So your duty and plant the Queen's Colours in faraway lands, bringing glory to yourself and your country and civilization to the dark continent! Where Crusader Kings II can be called an assassination simulator, and Europa Universalis IV a map painting sim, Victoria II could very well be labelled as an economic game at heart, with conquest simply serving to supply your nation with what it needs to conquer more land for more resources for more land to gain more resources to...you get the picture. That is not to say it is stale in any way, far from it! Victoria II will give you hours upon hours of enjoyment. Heartily Recommended. I will add that to get the most out of this game, both ""A House Divided"" and ""Heart of Darkness"" are absolutely necessary, they not only fix a great deal of issues with the game but make colonizing a much more immersive and challenging task and sure to bring all the more glory to your Queen and Country!

												Victoria II is the Godfather of grand strategy games if you ask me.The combat is complex enough without going to the extreme of Hearts of Iron 3.  That's not the point of the game, though.  Warfare in Victoria II, like in real life, is a means to an end, not the point itself or why you should buy the game.What makes it truly shine are the politics and economics which give Victoria II the best stuff to play around with during peacetime out of any other Paradox game, something sorely lacking in pretty much all the others, as well as machanics that provide a narrative to your campaign that makes it feel like you're actually playing a nation in the world, and not simply part of a multiplayer game with AI opponents.It makes diplomacy a lot more interesting and plausible than usual by modeling a system for instigating geopolitical crises, so gigantic wars between major powers erupt for actual reasons instead of endless gamey world conquest (except against uncivilized nations, which you can pretty much do with as you please, but that's historical for the time).  Even the tiniest nations are playable because you can use the crisis system to get major powers to back your claims to conquered cores.  Playing Greece and want your northern cores back from the Ottoman Empire?  You can never defeat them alone, but if you can get the United Kingdom or Russia on your side, it's entirely possible to fulfill your wildest revanchist dreams.It has a deep (but not impenetrable), economic system that makes makes that aspect of the game very interesting and engaging, as opposed to just placing a merchent guy on the map and collecting fees.  This era saw the rise of industrialism and tycoon capitalism, and they've done that justice.The politics system is very good as well.  Poor, middle, and elite classes all have their own wants, needs, political desires, etc. that break down to an impressively small scale.  The white yankee catholic factory workers will want one thing, while the black protestant southern miners will want something else.  If you don't handle politics smartly, you can have a revolution on your hands, which could even end with your government ideology completely changing.  It's entirely possible for the United States to become a fascist state, a Marxist-Leninist republic, or even return to monarchy.It's simply the deepest, best, most fun game Paradox has ever released in this man's opinion.10/10, would stamp out wickedness again.

												This game is fantastic. I remember in my first play through of the vanilla game in the middle of a massive world war between just myself (Germany) and the UK I noticed the People's Republic of the United States with an independent Manhattan Commune. In my next game with the A House Divided and Heart of Darkness DLC I played as Germany again but this time Russia released Poland as a sovereign nation become a democracy and lost world power status. At the same time French rebels would make it a democracy, then they would revolt to make it a communist government and then revolt again for the democracy all the while losing its industry and military and falling to 16th most powerful nation. As I dissected the Austrian Empire to be only the Danubian Federation (A smaller nation missing most of its eastern  territories) to be the 20th ranked country. Then after taking the resource rich Manchuria and Mongolia from the Chinese I was involved in a great war caused by the crisis system (allows smaller nations to get great powers to back their claims on other countries). Spain and the Ottoman Empire, who had colonized almost all of Africa save South Africa backed me up against the French, UK, the Danubian Federation and Italy during which I took most of India from the British and made them give the rest of it to their Indian Satellite nation Hyderabad. You can completely change history in a warped manner, Have the Ottoman's regain their former glory, help Spain reconquer their former colonies, form Scandanavia and take Finland back from Russia, westernize as Panjab and take India from the British.  Maybe you want to westernize as China and have your legions of soldiers annex Russia, Japan invade Germany. Building the Panama canal as Japan and doing all the things listed above are possible in Victoria 2 as if you can figure the complexity of the economy and population that pushes the game to more interesting heights each time you play.

												The French and their baguettesStarted as France with the goal in mind of destroying G-B and freeing the Indian people. We frenchmen were pulling out new inventions out of our butts and became a monopolized country with factories everywhere and railways that went to places even they didn't know. We colonized every possible colonial region we were deemed able to. We added all of Italy into our sphere along with the Suisse, Braziliens, Sokotians, Zulus and Madagascans. During the time, we were gaining thousands of pounds of ducats and eventually became millionaires(as far as ducats go in the game). Along with a standing army of roughly two hundred and forty three thousand and were the second highest as far as score and were even first in prestige. Then, 20 years after starting, the North German Confederation declared war upon us with the damned red coats. the french marched to the east and slaughtered thousands of Germans. And to the west we marched and slaughtered the british and sat there baguette and wine in hand over the dead corpses of our foes. We got greedy, we desired more than just fancy foods and victory. We desired land, we desired power and thought of our goal to liberate India. Greedily we added a wargoal to liberate India and all it's people and to reclaim our French territory in Canada(Québec). Little did we know, our downfall was immenent. As the wargoals were entered into the war, our infamy hit a solid 26 and then everything went down hill. Our army was mighty and fierce and feared throughout the land and word spread of our gains in the Franco-Prussian war,  however those who feared us would also be the ones to take up arms against us. All of a sudden, the Russians declare containment saying we, the innocent French, must disarm and pay out our asses so they could enjoy their socialist lifestyles. And then the Spaniards desired to weaken our army and steal our women, so them to declared upon us in hopes of weakening us. It does not end yet, the Dutch, the Dutch desired our women also and so they declared containment too. And so, the typical US mentality kicked in, and them too declared war. Not for our women, or wine, or money, or territory, but just to declared war for the fun of it. Even though less than 75 years ago we freed their ignorant asses from the Brits.With the downfall of France imminent, the French sought aid from their friends in Austria and their spheres, but little did they know, they were stuck up asses who sought France's imminent death. And so with baguette and wine in hand, the French army was slaughtered. Though, we survived all the wars and still had 2.5 million ducats in our banks. We sat atop a hill in Paris and watched as the world suffered at the hands of the Brits, because everyone turned their backs from the rightful world ruler, France. Victoria 2 is love, Victoria 2 is life.			",48,5,0,4,10,0,11

												*This review is for the full collection.*It's a slow and number-filled grand strategy game for the most patient of players with an interest in the time period (1836-1936). Same as other Paradox games, it's real-time but you'd be mad to play it without frequently pausing unless you already know what you're doing. Every Paradox game can be said to specialize in one aspect or another of grand strategy. Victoria II does politcs and technology best, but other aspects are generally well-done too.The period is a time of great powers flexing their muscle across the globe, vying for influence, territory and resources, and not usually through war but through diplomatic influence, alliances and colonization. Great powers ingame have special mechanics that allow them to add lesser counties to their Sphere of influence, giving them first dibs on resources and safety from invasion. That's not to say other countries are not worth playing, but the couple dozen of countries that have potential to be GPs have more flavor to them and really have disproportionate power thanks to a variety of bonuses that GPs enjoy. Much of the dynamic of the game comes not from painting the map (which is harder to do than other Paradox games if you stick to the recommended level of Infamy) but rather from trying to overtake other countries in Prestige, Industrial Power and Military Power for that coveted GP status.This is where the technology system helps even the odds for some countries, and it is good. Every technology has juicy bonuses as well as possible inventions (which have  a chance of occurring each month), which means that every tech brings big progress, giving you lots of freedom to focus on whatever playstyle you want, and making sure there is a great sense of progress all throughout the game. In fact, that sense of progress is done extremely well as different eras go by. You'll see armies and navies becoming faster, population increasing rapidly, industrialization progressing at an exponential rate, and battles becoming ever more bloody and longer, with an emphasis on defense. The scramble for Africa takes place in the 1870s and there's a couple of points where you will need to reorganize and rethink your army composition to account for the new nature of warfare, including new unit types.The combat in Victoria II is comparable to Europa Universalis - armies face each other with a vanguard and rearguard each, with a variety of bonuses and maluses affecting how much they hurt each other every day. The armies here tend to be large and the combat attrition-based. You're expected to swap armies to and from the meat grinder to ensure that your army's Organization lasts longer than the enemy's. Early on you'll have to worry about supply limits but with technology this becomes less of an issue, as battles in rough terrain accomodate fewer soldiers at a time anyway. This is definitely a game where you want to pause every day or two on large wars. Civilized countries can conscript part of their poor population, making for even larger armies. But later in the game these are pretty much just cannon-fodder unless you have some professional support waiting for them to help them overcome enemy defenses when attacking. The military AI of the enemy is actually somewhat competent. It'll at least know to avoid dubious battles, even when it outnumbers you but you have other advantages. It'll also use appropriate generals for what each army is doing (the generals have their own randomized bonuses). Still, the player's intellect is a force multiplier and you should be able to win any evenly-matched war. Specifically, the AI neglects to really rotate its reserves like a player would, and pull them back to be reinforced at the start of the month.Your country's ruling party affects a variety of things, most notably the level of involvement you have in the economy. Monarchies can appoint whichever party they want, except unwashed radicals of course. Many factors will affect which parties your population supports, including events, the standard of living, and Militancy and Consciousness levels. Consciousness reflects how much your population will press for reforms, either political or social. This has the double-bladed effect of boosting your research over time, but leading to rebellions if you fail to pass popular reforms. Which just might happen if your Upper House is not as keen on reforms as the general populace. Still, some countries like Russia can pretty much remain a monarchy throughout the game if you make sure your people are content. Every GP and Secondary Power has a slightly different experience, which is strongly influenced by how you manage the country. Absolute monarchies are much more smooth-sailing overall, but usually come with low literacy. China, Japan and the USA stand out from the rest, each with its own challenges and potential.There are many tradegoods, but trading and most of the economy usually work on autopilot, especially later in the game when in most types of government, capitalists are allowed a free hand in building up industries. Usually in not a very clever way as they will often just derp out and build a bunch of telephone factories that are just destined to close soon after. But it's the same for the AI countries, so hey. And if you want to micro everything yourself, you can go with State Capitalism or Central Planning policies, found at your local Reactionary, Socialist, Communist or Fascist party, and do everything yourself. At the expense of some efficiency, however. And lots of time, as you will have hundreds of factories by the late game. Still, the freedom is there and a whole different playstyle is available for those who want it.The diplomacy is fairly standard for a grand-strategy game, there's nothing too outstanding here. You make alliances, with a Prestige hit if you refuse to join a defensive war. If relations are bad enough between two countries, you can fabricate a Casus Belli, but be prepared to take a likely Infamy hit. This is actually the main way of getting aggressive wars started. There are random events that will give you a Casus Belli for no Infamy, but these are pure chance. Take too much Infamy, and everyone gets to fight you for free. The interesting bit is Crises - when a region gets 'hot' enough due to the presence of a Liberation Movement or other cause, the Great Powers will take sides and, if no compromise is met, will go to war. These are major and will change the face of the map in a different way every time. Here, I just wish the same hotspots wouldn't get hot so often, like in one of my games, Greece kept sparking a crisis every year for a while, with few exceptions as it just got hot faster than anyplace else. Still, it's a great system for keeping things fresh and interesting for GPs especially.So compared to other Paradox games, I would say it's more deterministic in that, short of some really gamey behavior, you're unlikely to paint the map the color of Peru or some other minor country. The focus is on GPs and SPs, expansionist warfare is rather limited except against uncivilized countries. You can only choose from two start dates - 1836 or 1861. The type of freedom and variety here is different from other Paradox games, it comes from the amount of control you have over politics and the economy, as well as how you meddle in world affairs. Instead of grabbing land from your civilized neighbors, you're supposed to humilate them, beat them down, leave them open to rebellion, take their allies away and in some cases fracture them into smaller nations.The game's timeframe is relatively short - though it still takes dozens of hours for a normal playthrough - but every game is guaranteed to be different thanks to the crisis system, rebels and other factors.

Well your in luck my brave friends because V2 is a great game. With a in depth and robust political,economic, and colonization systems in place as well as fun and at the same time challenging warfare. Pick any country in the whole world to play as and go to town I say! I could go in depth and waste your time, but instead just take my word, one gamer to another, that this is a great game once you understand it and even better with friends.                                                                    95/100			",162,20,1,28,23,2,43

												Alright, after nearly FIVE HUNDRED hours of fun, and countless more hours likely to come, I think it is far past time that I write my reccomendation for this game.DISCLAIMER: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME WITHOUT THE TWO MAIN EXPANSION PACKSFirst and foremost, let me be VERY clear. Victoria 2 is a very deep game, and regardless of your previous strategy experience, you will understand nothing diving headfirst into this game. You may THINK you understand what you are looking at, but you really don't. Like Dark Souls, your very first games, you will fail again and again and again. However, you will eventually, after a few hours, get the hang of things. And it is definetely worth the effort!Victoria 2 is by far my all time favourite game. Period. It is a grand strategy game set in the dawn of the Victorian era. France has been defeated just twenty years prior, the Ottoman Empire is dying, German nationalism is on the rise, and the British Empire is the greatest power in the world. In this game, you can click on any of the 150+ countries on the map and hop right in. Unfortunately, there are some nations which are simply not meant to be played, namely the Indian and German minor states.When you jump in, you will first notice an absolute flood of information, and all the tabs lead to spreadsheets (which are very intuitively designed). You will doubtlessly be overwhelmed, but that's okay. Everyone is. The reason for all this info is because you have control over every aspect of your nation. From Politics, to diplomacy, to military, to economy, it is all there. This probably seems scary to a new player, but this is what keeps me coming back to this game rather than EU4. There is a lot to do other than paint the map.Not being able to paint the map or not being able to do a world conquest is the beauty of this game though. It really forces your hand into diplomacy with other nations. Not only that, however, but this game goes much deeper than Europa universalis, for example. Every person is simulated (with populations rounded down to 1/4th of actual figures) and the game has a functioning global economy, with prices rising and falling, and economies of scale which can be affected by wars, rebellions, industry, you name it! You can also expand the influence of your nation, bringing smaller nations into your sphere, and using them as puppets to fight your wars, or to exploit their resources for your benefit. The possibilities in this game are truly endless.Unlike Crusader Kings or Europa Universalis, this game does not like to let you blob out. With the memory of Napoleon fresh in the minds of everybody, if you do too much aggressive action, you get these points called 'infamy' which slowly decays bi-monthly. If your infamy goes above a certain level (25.00) then every nation tends to attack you. To fend off these coalitions, you have to be immensely powerful, and this seems to be where new players are driven away. You cannot rely on blobbing out in this game, unless you can count on beating the combined forces of Europe alone. My word of advice: ALWAYS stay below the infamy.The negatives in this game are few and far between. There used to be still a handful of bugs, however these were patched just a few months ago. The only real issue I have is lack of steam multiplayer, which forces you to rely on programs such as 'Hamachi' just to play in a multiplayer session with friends. Another tiny negative is that the soundtrack does not have anything in store for the intense great wars of the late game, but this is very easily overlooked.A short list of pros and cons:Pros-Amazing gameplay, endless replayability which can keep you entertained for hundreds to thousands of hours!-Extremely deep 'simulation' (I hate using that word) of every nation-Very well optimized. Runs perfectly on my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptop, and even better on my main rig-Massive great wars. What's not to like?-Beautifully composed soundtrack-Detailed global markets and industry-Play as any nation in 1836 or 1861Cons-No steam multiplayerIf you are into strategy, and are willing to put 3-10 hours of 'trial and error' time into this game, then definetely pick it up (with all the expansions!). After learning the ropes, you will likely fall in love with this game as I have.			",82,6,2,10,39,0,31

												Victoria II is a grand strategy game played during the colonial era of the 19th century, where the player takes control of a country, guiding it through industrialisation, political reforms, military conquest, and colonization. Experience an in-depth political simulation where every action you take will have various consequences all over the world. The population will react to your decisions based on their political awareness, social class, as well as their willingness to accept or revolt against their government. This is a wonderfully deep game, and its sandbox nature is much more open than Hearts of Iron III was and so it's much more enjoyable at the beginning.Saying that it stands head-and-shoulders above all of the scant competition for grand-strategy kingship almost goes without saying.

												Wow, this is my favourite Paradox game now. Unlike EU3 and 4, war is the means, not the end. The end is your economy and population. You use war to support your economy, not the economy to support your wars. Lots of interesting themes like capitalism, industrialism, socialism etc. So fun.			",128,26,0,12,12,0,32

												This game is the current high point of Paradox's fledgling genre innovation. For those with an interest in 19th century politics Victoria 2 is a must have game, for those with an interest in grand strategy games Victoria 2 is the best in its field, if one is interested in both of these, this game is unbeatable.Beginning in 1836 Victoria 2 spans arguably the most important period of development in human history. You help guide an ancien regime Kingdom into the new era of democracy, representation and the nation-state. The scale of war increases exponentially over the course of the game as these nations bring the increasing destructive power of their economies to bear; exploiting more efficiently the fruits of technological change. This theme is manifested ingeniously in the game throughout a detailed population system that gives every person in the simulated world a purpose. Via this system the player can shift their population towards war, peace, colonisation and industrialisation.Victoria 2's map is beautifully realised and realistic in 2D, reminiscent of classic board games. Each nation is unique through the makeup of its population and their cultures and varying levels of technological development. This system allows the player to experience the fun of expanding the British Empire or French Empire (or any World power), or the challenge of fighting for survival as Ethiopia as European powers attempt to wrestle control of your homeland. Each nations uniqueness allows for almost infinite replayability and the structure through which the player chooses a nations path can follow the ideologies of the day. A fascist Russia, a democratic and fair Japan or a Communist United States of America are all possible and plausible but acheived with a naturality not present in Hearts of Iron 4 (where the player becomes fascist by pressing 2 buttons and waiting).The game's combat is fairly simplistic and not its strongest point, although with mods can be challenging and tense. The system of economic management in the game is so complex it's apparantly not fully understood by its developers however don't be put off. The player can choose to engage with every facet of the economic system or with surprising results can take an entirely laissez faire approach, allow the capitalists of the nation to go wild and see what they can do instead, its all up to the player.These complexities allow for the development of a clear playstyle for each player, which means that in multiplayer is where Victoria 2 really shines. There is nothing quite like holding a conference of the great powers to attempt to defuse a crisis, or betraying your French allies to take more of Africa as Great Britain. Diplomacy and interaction is possible in this game that trancends its mechanics and allows for extra-ordinary campaigns that will be played late into the night and possibly into the morning.Unfortunately if one takes a look at the graphics options they will find nowhere near enough anti-aliasing graphics options and the game can't maintain a consistent 30 frames per second - 2/10 avoid.Seriously though Victoria 2 is the current great of its genre and is obviously one of my favourite games of all time.

												The most complex, historically accurate and rewarding grand strategy game I have ever had the pleasure of playing.  If you are interested in European history circa 1830-1936, this game is a must have!  I have played several Paradox titles (EUIV, CKII) but Victoria II stands in a league of its own.  The sheer amount of depth provided lets you feel like you are actually in command of an entire nation.  The learning curve is not terrible, but an online tutorial (letsplay.com, youtube) is definitely recommended.  This game pulls you in and never lets go. Therefore I can whole-heartedly recommend that you go forth and conquer savage natives, for Queen and country!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Otto von Bismark: The Game.Victoria II is a game about careful economic planning, diplomatic maneuvering, colonial expansionism, and trying your very best to prevent Germany from forming.You take control of a nation and guide them from 1836 to 1936, and your goal is to become the world's foremost economic and military power.The control you exert over your nation is, however, indirect at best and tenuous at worst: you can't just ""make"" more factory workers, for instance. Instead you have to manipulate conditions - taxation, education, employment opportunities - to encourage people to go into that line of work. Similarly, you don't get to decide what form of government your nation adopts, but are often at the whims of revolution. All of this is underpinned by a detailed economic simulator based on supply and demand that acts in mysterious ways to dictate the fate of the powers. Coupled with a diplomatic system based around alliance blocs and the concept of influence, this makes Victoria II feel like a realistic simulation of the long nineteenth century. This doesn't mean that you have no control over your own fate: only terrible players get swept along with the simulation. Once you're able to see the way things tie together, you can spend hours carefully crafting your plans to then spring everything together as soon as an opportunity is presented - which is exactly how 19th century realpolitik functioned. Because of all this, the stories that come out of a game of Vicky often feel engaging and realistic, and you can actually imagine reading about them in a history book somewhere.The game's not perfect, of course, and the simulations can often break down or be gamed around by clever players. As the oldest still-current Paradox title, it's also starting to show its age a bit, with launcher issues and the occasional silly bug. More subtly, because it's a strategy game about a historical period that had a very definite, very tragic and very recent ending, Vicky can be a little deterministic in its interpretations of history. Thus, for example, Prussia tends to industrialize rapidly, grow its military power, hammer Austria  and unify Germany - exactly as happened in reality. Only in reality, it happened as a result of specific actions taken by certain people in positions of power across the continent, so it would be natural to assume that those people acting differently would've created a different outcome. Yet because Paradox (and the rest of us) know how things turned out, the mechanics feel tipped in favour of that outcome.			",234,55,2,50,32,4,74

												This is the story of the once great nation of Sweden.Its the early 1840's, Sweden is in crippling debt and the people are on the verge of revolution.The new king is crowned and begins to reform the goverment, becoming a conservitive party.Sweden begins to thrive under the rule of this new king, with the United Kingdom taking notice.Over many decades Sweden finally becomes a great power leading in both prestige and industry.After on and off war with Norway and Denmark, Sweden abandones it's desire for expansion.Over the years Sweden had its fair share of rebel uprisings, none the Swedish military couldn't handle.Breaking News hits the papers, Swedish patriots storm the capital of Finland, causing them to surrender.The Swedish king then annexes most of Finland, leaving one tiny province.Sweden begins a new golden age, becoming one of the most respected nations in the world.Germany, Sweden's neighbor down south becomes a democracy and allies with Sweden.While Russia becomes the Soviet Union and puts troops on the Swedish Border.1904, the great war starts.The UK and Germany fight together against the French and AustriaSweden joins the war and sends their best men to help out on the Magniot.Germany pushes hard into Austria while Sweden protects them from the french.The people of germany, tired from the war, rise up.The entire country is at war with itself, with millions of rebels helping the French-Austrian Alliance.The 1st Swedish Royal army, Sweden's best and most prestigious army comes under fire from the German Rebels.The battle lasts for many weeks untill the Swedish army is slaughtered by the Rebel Tide.Thousands Die.The Second Swedish Reserve Army is trapped in Austria.Led by Sweden's best general, they manage to fight their way through the remaining Austrian army and the Rebels to the last bastion of the German Military.The German Military covers the swedish escape to the last port.Millions Die.The Reserve army finally escapes europe and returns home.Germany and the UK both fall to rebel uprisings.The Great War ends and Sweden is surrounded by the Russians and the French.Fighting a war on 2 fronts the Swedish people are slaughtered by the thousands.After many years of fighting Sweden falls.The king is killed and Sweden is annexed to The Soviet Union.Even though the goverment and the country has fallen, the Swedish resistance still fights their Soviet Masters to this day. Some say you can still hear the echoes of the brave men who fell in defense of their homeland. ",155,14,0,19,21,0,32

												My favorite Paradox game to date, you simply cannot go wrong with Victoria 2, especially if you enjoy 19th and early 20th century history. This game is not simply about war (as most other strategy games are), but industry, diplomacy, colonization, revolution, all in a hyper-realistic mold. It may seem challenging at first, but the first time you form Italy as Sardinia-Piedmont, or Germany from Prussia, you get that sense of accomplishment which few games otherwise give you.

I could have been the U.S and colonize all of Africa and slowly push out and opposition, claiming the land mass to myself and only myself.Instead, I did nothing above. I played as the great nation of Bhutan. Slowly I took over the nearby one state nations nearby, and eased my nation to great power. It took longer than expected, though. Had to modify the game files to set the end date to December 31st, 9999. By this time, Bhutan was all, and all was Bhutan.I rate this game a solid 10 / 10. It's ok.			",55,4,1,8,15,0,12

												My story is not as much of a joyous, but rather grim, a story of oppression, a story of predatory capitalism, a story of effects when bad people are let in handles of power, imperialism.I started my reign as the king of Sweden, my nation's coffers were on negative side, it was a choice of cuts or massive debts. The industry was nowhere to be found, my nation was crumbled. My nation had lost its status as an Empire a long time ago, our Eastern front, Finland, was sadly in Russian hands. It was time to make Sweden Great Again.Couple of years, decade or few, my country's economy was flourishing again and I could easily say that we had the first actual welfare state while also being thousands silver kronors in profit every month. Our capitalists were happy with their factories built with state's money and brought quite a merry profits for my coffers, besides of course offering workplace for every citizen in my country.My country provided healthcare, pensions, minimum wage, unemployment bonus, excellent educational system, everything one would presume finding from a modern successful welfare state. Then I, and my council, found out how oppressed and poor our Southern neighbours in Denmark were, I of course as great humanitarian had to intervene when I saw their sorrow and on advice of my Council (ooc: RL-friends watching my play) I declared war to liberate the Danish people as our brothers and sisters and bring them under the Swedish flag. My intentions were purely good. Yet some did not like it. I also tried to liberate our Finnish brothers under Russian flag to be united with us again with help of International help, sadly international community was not very helpful on my cause.The status quo started to change after liberating the Denmark and as the wealth of my country spread far. Nations close and far started to attack to ""contain my aggression"", bah, I merely liberated them. First war or two I won defending my country from Southern and Eastern invaders. Then I lost my beloved subjects in Denmark as I lost the war and had to cede it back to their and Danish oppressive leadership. The wars of containment became monthly, almost daily, robbers came from as far as Turkey, . On worst time I had seven or eight nations ""containing my aggression"", most of them doing that for I know not how many times already, four, five, seven? Nevertheless, in the end I had few dozens of peace deals which in theory would've been taking about 500-1,000% of my collected taxes and then of course effectively had demilitarized whole Sweden.I gave order for my councillors to come up with a way to make Sweden Great Again, and they thought: what would Hiedler do? Well we called both of Johann Hiedlers, Georg and Nepomuk, and asked for their advice. Following their advice, I fired the current government and gave power to a party which name I can not remember, but they swore in the name of this new movement called fascism. With their help I abolished the taxes from my people, as those money were going straight to robbers and criminals of South and East, no more I said. Then I just raised the tariffs to about 20-30% and my economy flourished again, as the foreign powers only wanted the tax money, which was none. My welfare national socialist Sweden felt Great Again, all thanks to my council-approved Hiedler-approach.We made Sweden Great once Again.For a year or two anyways. Some wars of containment were still held in this time, and still they continued, but why should've I cared for those, they weren't getting anything anyways. Well some separatist movements sadly rose after the last war I made peace with, my country was militarized again with a force that probably could've marched over United States, all of Europe and Russia with ease, not to mention recently westernized China. Actually probably most of my population was revolting against my rule, although I don't know quite the reason as their living conditions were like from few centuries forwards. Due to continuous wars and those damned surely imperialist-backed separatists they 'liberated' the Norway, we would've not needed them anyways. But then those imperialists got the catch I was cheating on them and was paying nothing. In time after those rebels and once more demilitarized it was Belgia to first notice it, and declared war to annex the Northern Sweden, well they got it with ease, as I still could've not get armies raised. Then came France or Italy, who annexed the Southern Sweden. Then came the Turks who conquered the rest.I made Sweden Great Again not only once but twice, and the teaching of the story? People do not like not being taxed and that crony capitalist imperialists do not like when someone out-earns and lives better than them. So do not try to make welfare system of the future few centuries early.5/7 (for those who understand) or 10/10 play, laughed much with friends in the end-game, I'd approve.			",143,46,2,26,43,0,39

												Great game if you want to slaughter thousands of uncivilized nations. but in all honesty Victoria 2 is a great gateway paradox strategy game and after more of 300 hours of playtime its still very much enjoyable. here are some pros and cons PROS  The game is long. it will take you roughly a good couple of days to finish a game from start to finish. The game forums on paradox's main site are extremly helpful as well as the steam forums, mostly all major issues have Fixs and can be solved easily by search the forums Great mod community. although no more major are really being made Victoria 2 has some spectular mods that make that gives the the game a lot more replay-ability. for example theres the GSG Mod or the Kaiserreich Mod  The game is super simple and very easy to pick up and master in about a week's time, this is probably the easiest strategy game that paradox has ever made. CONS  Victoria 2 can be very unstable, Although the forums have a fix for just about everything it doesnt excuse how many times the game crashed with a long error code that took me a good amount of time to find a fix for. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ multiplayer, Compared to  Europa and Hearts Of Iron. the game stutters and pauses a lot more than i would of liked -granted i dont know if this is a common problem because upon searching for a quick fix not to many results came up- It NEEDS mods, the base game is perfectly fine but it gets stale quick, about 100 hours in i already played every single country from start to finish. Victoria does have a lot of great mods like stated before but the game really depends on them after a certain point. Overall i highly reccomend this game for anyone interested looking for a easy to master but still fun to play strategy game that you'll have no problem logging hundred maybe even thousands of hours into.

												The best strategy game ever released in my opinion, like most Paradox Interactive games it will take you a long time to master but once you do prepare for hours and hours spent in this game.Make sure to buy the DLC's for better experience. Only bad side-effect is that hosting-joining a multiplayer game can be quite a bugger. At any case, Buy this game as long as it's still on sale!			",57,7,0,2,7,0,13

												For starters, this game is only for those who love immersive Risk type games. Specifically a in-depth strategic game. However, this makes it very complicated to learn how to play, effectively. (For me at least). But, once I did a few tutorials, I got the hang of things, and enjoy the game fully now. This is really one of my favorite all time games, ever. Across all platforms, its just so great of a price, and a game. Its just fantastic. I'm not much of spoiler, so I'll leave the specifics for you all to figure out. To me, this is worth every cent. Heck, I enjoy this game so much, I'm buying another copy of it for a friend. So long as the price stays down. All in all, I recommend this game 100%.  Cheers!			",16,1,0,1,10,0,12

												Victoria 2 is easily one of the best games I have played to date. To begin, the military system is brilliant, bringing manpower in to the fold of the amazing population mechanic in the game brings an interesting and favourable change to the more generic systems that you would find in ck2 or eu4 and each unit is unique in it's own way, I love the names given to each unit, the fact that their stats change throughout the game and how eventually you can even recruit tanks and planes into your by then massing armies, this system also ties into trade requiring different materials to complete each and every unit, I would wish that you could sign trade agreements with individual countries like in other paradox games however Victoria 2 compensates for this by introducing an interesting and ever changing global economy. Research is also one of my favorite parts of this game as you must choose to sacrifice certain technologies for others and unlike eu4 with only 3 platforms to research on with 1 researchable item on each this has several platforms with several items on each. Your internal politics is again a great part of victoria 2 with parties forming coalitions and popularity largely based off of population. The party in power can often limit what you can do within the game, such as building factories and negative parties that limit your control can often come about if you extort you population. Even if you are lucky enough to have a government that allows you to choose the party in power, it may often fail to stop parties coming in power through revolution. In my opinion diplomacy can sometimes be lacking but again the choices you make internally and externally can bring about the birth of nations and the fall of others, perhaps even your own. Yet there are negatives. The world crisis mechanic can often fail to even create a large war, and often it can cause the same war to happen again and again if it does start a war. Moving on, the civil war mechanic used to kick off the american civil war is honestly wasted compaired to it's potential, this mechanic can only influence the american civil war not any other possible civil war meaning that any possible 'civil wars' will only come in the form of rebels. Lastly colonization is also somewhat bad, though it is fun to colonise much of africa and asia governing the new land can often  just be a hastle. TLDR: This game is good, very good and you should play it. 10/10.			",31,4,0,7,20,0,16

												Hello, my name is Kaiser Anony1200. You may know me for being the patron saint of this game.With a good base game and some really wonderful expansion packs, Victoria 2 is such a neat game, with a variety of things to do, ways to challenge yourself,  as well as semi-consistent updates to help keep the game fresh. There's a huge variety of mods which do a huge variety of things, and the base game itself is pretty much as complicated as you make it out to be- Newer players can test the waters in the safer areas of the world, while more advanced players can play as a greater power competing for influence, micromanage the markets of its land, and play politics to ensure the right party gets (and stays) in power, all in their attempt to achieve the status of #1 in the world, to either oust the damned British or let old Queen Victoria keep her spot on the throne of nations. Your quest to become the empire on which the sun never sets will not go without adversity- the AI presents a fair challenge to any player and often makes cunning moves to protect its own power and hegemony in the status quo, while weaker powers opportunistically enroach on greater nations through diplomacy or sword to attempt to make themselves a name and put themselves on the map. Finally, internal strife hampers many prospective nations of Europe, as German and Italian states squabble amongst themselves to try and become the best. The world needs a great leader, and that person could very well be you.If I had to give any downsides, it'd be the fact that the Infamy system is still a little imbalanced (the 2 province Luang Prabang kingdom being annexed by you is just as costly as finishing off the respected kingdom of Egypt, perhaps even moreso), the fact that there are a lot of prospective time period countries not represented (Which has been dealt with), and the fact that the tutorial is sort of outdated and not very helpful (WHICH I MANNED UP AND DEALT WITH MYSELF).Overall, I would highly recommend the Victoria 2 complete edition, or at the very least, as much as you can get out of it. It's a great introduction to grand strategy and one that's kept me interested for a very long time.			",101,5,1,13,16,3,36

												Those of you who want this game let me give you a little insight of what to expect.(*Content may be sensitive to some viewers....viewers discretion is advised....) I casual strolled the the mall one casual cold morning in mid January. I picked up a few things that were on sale from the leftovers of christmas when I overheared 2 people in the local gamestop talking very fervently of something. ""Pardox Interactive"" was one word also ""HOI"". Then it came to me like a chill in the wind a ""reckoning"" if you will the words ""Victoria 2"". Even more intrigued as the victorian era was a favorite of mine (after all who dosn't appreciate getting there hands cut off for not meeting your rubber quota) I paid for my items and went home. Google the best bud of capitalist and farmer alike came onto the screen as I finished cooking dinner. Victoria 2 my fingers could not type the 2 words fast enough Victoria, Victoria VICTORIA....there it was all the different wikis and strategies from recent playthroughs I...well I had to take a peak not knowing that this leap of fate would rock my world to its core. Steam had not been on my computer for some time I immediatly booted it and bought Victoria 2. I...well I can't tell you the exact details of ""the dream"" I dubbed it to my psychaitrist but it was  amazing as if a diving being had been inside the script of Victoria 2. As I dreamed for hours, days, MONTHS EVEN YEARS I began to find my everday routine revolving around turning Greece into a socialist empire. One day maybe a year (im not sure the time frame as I was certainly in limbo) from when I first opend this beauty I found a knock on the door. This knock was different than the others a more forceful, demanding knock.I opened it to find a sherrifs deputy on my front. As I was almost blinded by the sunlight, dazed almost to H**l and back, legs throbing ( but what I understand I did very little moving save to eat sleep and bathroom) I barely remember what the officer said save for ""evict"" and "" 3 weeks"". I closed the door as he left and gathered my self to go to the kitchen for a spot of whiskey (helps reinvigorate the senses). Then as I left the flask on the table went to the tele and found 148 messages un heared. I wont bore you with every one but I found that 2 of my close family had died, my reltionship with the opposite sex went bust and my landlord was very angry. Then I well I passed out as I had drank a little to much whiskey. The next thing I knew I was in a hospital bed on an IV and ventilator in critical condition (the officer had forgotten to give me the paper work and had found the door unlocked thank heavens :) ). With my story now being at its end let me leave you with a warning. This ""game"" is no mere toy but a weapon used by the gods to entrap mortals in an endless time warp. So if you want to have cases of water beside you, dozens of pizza boxes around you and writing a story due to a shrinks orders then BUY THIS GAME....and if not..... then please stay away as your life will never EVER be the same.          P.S. I was declared mentally incapaccitated by 10/10....			",32,3,0,6,10,0,13

												This is by far my favourite Paradox game, its not dumbed down like EU4 or HoI4. It has some cool features like the spheres of influence. The game can be hard at first but you pretty much learn by watching some tutorials and actually playing the game. Its fun to chase after goals like uniting Germany or Italy, but the colonization is probably one of my favourite parts in the game, and its not boring like in EU4 where its just waiting around.I am not very good at writing reviews so I will just end this here, I recommend the game for anyone who likes grand startegy games.

It has a great political and diplomatic system, and its always fun to expand your country by force. Change history, and win the civil war as the confederates, or take Hawaii as Japan before the USA starts taking an interest! It truly is a great game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Probably the Best Paradox game. (9.5/10)Here's my 2c.--> DIFFICULTY <--The learning curve is steep, but absolutely worth the effort. If you've played other Paradox titles such as Hearts Of Iron III, you will may be familiar with some of the game mechanics and concepts, although this one is unique. You may have to play around 50 hours before you start to get the hang of the Diplomacy and the Economics, but as I said - absolutely worth it.--> ATMOSPHERE <--I love the music in this game, I find it very immersive. --> STRATEGY <--The AI in this game is excellent. (It's like it ""knows"").If you like Grand Strategy in a historical context, then this is your game.--> GRAPHICS <--Nice,.. quite nice in fact, but nothing too fancy. ==> SUMMARY <==Say goodbye to the wife and kids.This is your new life.

												I finally got around to sitting down and playing Victoria 2 for a while (~15 hours, a very small amount of time for this genre) over the weekend.It's now my favorite Paradox game. It knocked CK2 right off of that pedestal and took its spot. The population mechanic, the political structure. Infamy is a much better system than EU4s Aggressive Expansion. Plus it's in one of the most significant eras in recent history (1835-1935, with HoI3 picking the timeline back up in 1936 so that they could have one whole game for the WWII era.)All of those mechanics make it really hard to understand at first, though. The economy doesn't help either. It's daily, not monthly like in most Paradox games, so you go bankrupt much faster if you've got a loss, even a small one like -5. The population mechanic mixes with the economy mechanics very well; You can't raise taxes too high or your population won't be able to afford their needs. If you raise taxes on the rich, they won't invest in any industry and you'll have a bunch of unemployed citizens unless you reorganize your government to make the economy state-centralized and more socialist.The political structure is also a very interesting mechanic. As long as you have a monarchy of some form, you can choose what the ruling party is. If the citizens do not agree with that ruling party, however, they will slowly become more militant and more likely to revolt against you. If you switch to a system where people have the power to vote, then they will be much less militant but you may find yourself with policies you don't necessarily support.The country ranking system is also a very good idea, and very representative of this time period. The top 8 countries in the world will become Great Powers, and can influence all of the other countries to potentially bring them into their Sphere of Influence, making them allies as well as protecting the smaller countries from harm. The next 8 become Secondary Powers, who are allowed to colonize and can, at any point in time, over take the Great Powers to become one of the top 8 and gain everything that comes with that.While the interface is occasionally clunky, that's to be expected with older Paradox games. Despite this, you can find pretty much everything you need fairly easily.It's a fantastic game. Very addicting. Don't buy it if you value control over your own life because it will very quickly consume all of your free time.			",57,15,0,24,9,2,18

												Victoria II is one of the most fun strategy/economic games I have ever played. Albeit playing anything but European powers is a very disappointing and ultimately boring experience, playing as one of those powers will provide hours and hours of entertainment. Victoria II is a game that is quite unique and doesn't play like other games I have played before, which is also true for many other Paradox's games. Victoria focuses on politics of running a country and on the population of the country. It stands somewhere between games like Crusader Kings, where the internal politics is most important and player plays a role of a single character, and Europa Universalis, where only external politics matters and the player basically plays as a whole country. In Victoria 2 player has to manage government and satisfy the population's demands or suppress it, but conquest also plays a very important role and the game forces the player to take part in many wars. In addition, the economic side of the country is also under the control of the player (or not, depending on the political system). Hence Victoria II is quite incomparable strategy game and I recommend at least giving it a try. I had a lot of fun in the game and so should you, especially if you like strategy games.Oh, and the music in the game is gorgeous! ",390,117,27,79,52,1,87

												I have at least another 130 or so hours in offline.9/10   Switzerland is NOT neutral, I repeat Switzerland is NOT neutral.NOTE: THIS GAME MAY BE DIFFICULT TO GET RUNNING BUT IS DEFINITELY WORTH THE EFFORTI love this game, it let me execute someone because they spoke of the oppression of the Quebecois peopleYou can:>Become a great power as a tiny island in the artic ruled by polar bears.>Be Fascist Quebec and colonize Africa.>Be the Zulus and destroy the white invaders of the Dark Continent.>Watch Prussia and Austria go to war 5 times in less than 30 years>Watch France surrender to literally everyoneSeriously though, Victoria II is probably my favourite game I play on PCPROS:+You can play as a LOT of countries, pretty much every country that existed in 1836 or 1861, and if that country didnt exist in that time period, you can probably form it, S Rhodesia, Canada, Arabia, Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, etc+Huge Economic system that includes a real market+A pretty good system of Internal and international politics, that happen in every country+Army and battle system is not TOO complicated, but might be a bit difficult to figure out+All the big countries, most of the average, and some of the small ones have realistic personalities, ex Prussia will almost always fight France to get Alsasce Lorraine and form Germany, UK likes to stay our of mainland Europe until the later 1800s, Brazil is a bully+Hundreds upon hundreds of countries+Lots of mods (Old school style, not workshop *sadface*)+Even though countries act realisticly, you are not forced to follow history at allCONS:-Game is difficult to figure out quickly, takes at least 20 hours to get a decent understanding of the game-Tutorial is BORING  (Just use youtube, the tutorials are not worth it.)-Makes time disappear  (Social life, sleep time, homework)-Crashes occasionallyI just want to stress again how many awesome countries you can be. Gran Colombia, North/South German Confederation, Newfoundland, New England, Manhatten, Yugoslavia, Arabia, Israel, Greater Germany, Poland-Lithuania, Byantine Empire, Babylon, and many MANY more. 212 countries in total.Modding is pretty easy, I made one for the place I live, and it took me about 10-20 mins to set it up.I love this game and really hope after HoI IV they make Victoria III.Reccomended to history nerds like me or people that like playing as Prussia/NGF/Germany 60 times in a row and not getting bored of itSeriously though, this is a really good game. I like it.			",29,4,0,3,17,0,20

												Before I start my review, I would like to say that this game is definately not for people new to grand-strategy games and it has a very steep learning curve. Even if you have played other grand-strategies, I recommend watching/reading tutorials as this game can be very complicated at times.The game starts in 1836 and runs up until 1936, in the era of Victoria and one of the most important periods of development in human history. You guide your nation of choice into a new era of politics and diplomacy and witness the growing strength of the world powers. Unlike most strategy games where you try to conquer territory, in Victoria 2 you attempt to become a great power and influence smaller nations into your 'Sphere of Influence'. You have to manage your economy, your political party, your army, your colonial empire and your diplomacy.  Victoria 2 has a beautiful 2D map, in the style of classic board games. You can play as any nation represented on the map and any releasable nation in the game. All nations are unique through their population, culture, technological development and political systems. You can have fun expanding a great empire or experience the challenge of fighting for survival as a minor nation in Africa or Asia. Each nations uniqueness allows for infinite replayability.The game's combat is fairly simplistic and not it's strongest point. The system of economic management is very complex and it's best to leave trade to the AI. You can choose to play with every aspect of your economy or leave it all to the AI. The game has many nations to play as, playstyles to try and lands to conquer. It is a must play and I cannot wait for a Victoria 3. I recommend this game to grand strategy players and people looking for a hard challenge.			",105,16,3,16,24,1,25

												Victoria 2 is a prime exampe of a complex and challenging strategy game. It has a steep learning curve but it is very rewarding  if you put in the time. In no other game can you form fascist Israel or Communist USA. It is truly a unique game and a textbook example of what Paradox Interactive is capable of.

												This game is magnificent. I'm gonna start by saying this, if you're new to Grand-Strategy games I do not recommend you this game, but if you do have experience in Grand-strategy games, this is a must to play.Even those who does have experience in Grand-Strats and plan on buying this game make sure you research how to play because this game is gonna be more complicated and frustrating if you don't know what you're doing. Victoria 2 is based on the era of Victoria (Obviously) and starts in the year 1836 and ends in 1936 so you have 100 year to play in one country it might look little but it actually does take quite a while. Unlike most strategy games where you usually just try to conquer, in victoria 2 when you are big you try to influence other small country to your side so you can challenge the bigger ones while managing your economy, your political party, your army, your colonization, and your diplomacy . Sooner or later you will see the big power house going in crisis wars until later on it becomes world wars. I geniuenly enjoyed this game at a full extent and I'm still not close to be done playing it. There are soo much things you can do in the game and I never got bored playing it. Yes sometimes it may be frustrating because you aren't doing well in the game but you get better and gets more enjoyable when time comes by. In a nutshel you if you're playing a power house you get to be like the USA IRL and meddle with anything that happens. I strongly recommend this game to whoever that like difficult and more realistic Grand Strategy games. ",42,12,0,17,6,0,14

Posted: July 28, 2014
												So I've played Victoria II + expansions (AHD and HOD) for a bit (mostly POP demand mod) and I'm certainly no grand master of strategy or anything, but there are still a ton of things that annoy to no end about this game. They annoy me so much I've decided to write this entire rant about them. My experiences with these kind of games are rather limited, I've played HoI 2 like 70 years ago quite a lot and HoI 3 only for about 10 minutes cause I ♥♥♥♥ing hate sliders. Otherwise I've played some of the older Total War games and Civ games (including Civ 5) but I can't really compare this game to Crusader Kings 2 oder EU 4 or something. I'm just some guy on the internet so I have honestly no idea how to systematically review things so I'll just name things as they come to mind.So first, what exactly is this game trying to be? It's trying to be rather historically accurate but at the same time... it's not. When compared to the mass of events you have in HoI, the game feels really empty. That is understandable as HoI covers a much shorter time range and allows for a more historical simulation. But did really so little happen during those 100 years that most events you have are just random events during elections and such? I wish there were more events that influence my relations with neighbouring countries and such. But instead, everyone is just sitting there and I'm only increasing or decreasing my relations over the diplomacy screen. Lame. At the same time, it's like the game is discouraging 'unhistorical' conquest. Why do I get a massive hit for administrative effenciency (or whatever it's called) for a state just because it's not a 'core' area of my country? You'd think after 50 years of something, people would get used to being citizens of my country, but nope. You don't even have any way of influencing core areas.As usual, the tutorials suck. They show you every screen of the game once and that's about it. What is it with these kind of games and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ tutorials? This game was released in 2010, do they still expect players to read through the manual (100 damn pages)? Tell me the most important stuff during the tutorial or have useful tooltips during the game, damn it. It's not like in League of Legends or similar games where most knowledge is meta stuff that you learn as you play, so it's not like it would be entirely impossible to have a decent tutorial. What research should I focus on? What should my army composition look like? What do all the stats a general has mean? Well, good luck finding out.The AI sucks. They are incredibly hesistant when it comes to alliances but they will allow basically everyone and their mom military access to their country. Yeah right. It's almost as if borders don't particularly matter. They are also incredibly incompetent when it comes to managing an uncivilized country (or unciv as the community calls them). So don't expect anything from AI controlled uncivs in this game. You'd expect them to wage wars against each other and try to become a relevant country in their area. But instead they just sit there, eventually going bankrupt. Would a decent AI for unvics be too much to ask for? The fact that those countries never manage to do anything really takes away from the game.Also the AI is just so incredibly stupid when it comes to leading wars. Unlike in HoI, you can't just declare war on a country. You always need a casus belli (CB) to declare war on someone and if you don't have one, you gotta make one. But making one risks you getting caught which results in you getting infamy (which gets reduces each month) and a lot of infamy is bad (like unrest in HoI). You'd think the AI uses their infamy wisely to press their advantage, but nope. They often just sit there with 0 infamy. But at the same time, when they do have a CB, they will often go to war even when it's complete suicide. You'd think the AI would be competent enough to calculate whether they can win a war or not, but nope. So Germany goes to war against France and gets their♥♥♥♥♥handed to them for no real reason. Over and over.Naval units suck. The game only simulates a global market rather than local markets or supply lines so you can't block a country from trading or anything. Hey Paradox, ever heard the term 'Pax Britannica'? Why can't ships support your land units or anything? During that time, a superpower without a strong fleet would have been unthinkable. But according to this game, all you need is a strong land army to beat your neighbours over and over. Also, is a global market really realistic? I mean sure, the superpowers probably had plenty of international trade going on, but did all the backwards Asian countries or small European countries really trade on a global scale? I can't believe that. You'd think a game about a time where a strong fleet was basically the most important thing in the world would concentrate on forcing the player to play along, but nope.The economy is so hard to follow. Why are the production and trade screen seperate? You know, seeing how much stuff I produce and how much is traded (supply/demand) is sometimes important to know so why not just have it on one screen? Doesn't make any sense. It's also hard to understand why your factories aren't selling all their stuff. What's the problem with not selling everything anyway? You'd think they can just store some of their productions and sell it later when demand is higher. But nope. Apparently furniture unsold gets thrown away or something. And why can't the game tell me in a coherent way how much demand for a certain good exists in my own damn country, so I'd know if it's worth producing something myself or not. And sort the goods in some alphabetical order or something. Sometimes you're just searching your♥♥♥♥♥off looking for something.Land battle simulation sucks. You know, in HoI, a lot goes into decent planning of an invasion. Not crossing rivers for an attack. Not attacking with too many units from one area (cause generals have a limited number of units they can command, everything beyond is ineffective). Not attacking during winter. Not going for a naval invasion when there are units defending an area. Not trying to do a huge attack in some mountain area. You know, all that kind of stuff that you have to consider in real life. But in Victoria 2, forget all that and just throw your armies together into one big battle! All you need are some good dice rolls and you win. The dice rolls♥♥♥♥♥♥me off so much. I mean, imagine in Starcraft, a zergling wouldn't hit for 5 damage with every attack. Instead the game rolled a dice for damage between 1 and 10. That's what it's like in this game. I always thought Napoleon or other figures had such outstanding military success because of their superior military strategies or whatever, but according to this game, he probably just had good dice rolls.The recruitment system sucks. I like the idea that I can't form units with soldiers of different nationality, but why can't certain religions mix? I guess the game just didn't have a way to deal with that so that kinda sucks. And what's with all the soldiers I have in my empire that aren't enough to form a unit? What do they do all day? Nothing? And what happens when I disband a unit that doesn't have a POP large enough to support them? I can't re-recruit them, so where do all the soldiers go? Do they just disappear? I don't get it.Oh well, I could rant on and on about things I don't like in this game, but nobody is ever going to read it all anyway. So screw that. I guess it's only really fun in multiplayer.

												Victoria 2, yet another Grand Strategy produced by Paradox Interactive, however unlike Europa Universalis taking you through the Early-Modern period, Hearts of Iron taking you through the second world war, Victoria 2 takes you through the Victorian era, a period of colonization, Nationalism, Industrialization, and Westernization.You play as Literally any country from 1836, from the United States of Central America to the Free City of Kraków, and guide it through the Industrial era and the Victorian era.Forge your destiny as you Guide your nation through 100 years of industrialization, war, and colonization, vie for Great Power Status and sign Alliances that at a split second, could be aimed at you, survive anarcho-liberal uprisings and anti-western Partisans as you try to Westernize as Japan.Along with nations that already exist, there are some that are relasable or formable; defeat the Russian Empire as Sweden and Form Scandinavia, release Scotland from the United Kingdom and form your own Empire.Play as Prussia and Form The North German Confederation, and then Germany, play as Two Sicilies and form Italy, play as France and become a giant Blob, the choice is yours, for 100 years you are free to achieve your goals, and watch the world change, not even the AI choose the same path each time.Will the Communist Rebels in France take Paris and install their own Government? Will the Anarcho-Liberal anarchists take power in Russia? Will America spread burgers throughout the world? Will the Soviet Union fall to Democratic Germany, will Fascist France continue its rivalry with Communist Britain? Will Australia become a Communist Global power and vie with Democratic New Zealand? Or will the Democratic Rebels in the West stutter the Aussies' Chances? Will the Irish Rebels beat back the British units and Declare independence? Will Liberia colonize all of Africa before the Scramble even starts? Will Texas Annex Mexico? Will the California Republic invade Hawaii? Will the CSA end the Civil war with a Stalemate? Will the CSA come begging to the USA again for Union? Will Poland into Space? Will Bolivia into Coastline? Will Switzerland sit on its bum and watch the world go by? Will China industrialize and defeat the Western industry? Will Russia keep Alaska? I'm not certain, but all of this is possible in Victoria 2.			",65,10,0,6,15,3,15

												Victoria 2 is actually the best game of the genre. It has a deep combat system but above all, it has a (barely) functioning ecenomy, a complex political system and much more!I have played EU3, CK2, EU4 and a lot of strategy games but I keep coming back at this one.

												As of 30/05/15 I have played much more Victoria 1 than 2 however that will soon change. Personally I love both games in short I loved Victoria 1 as it allowed me to function militarily or economically in huge detail, whereas most games only allowed me to do one of these in the detail I wanted. As in my review for Victoria 1 I would like to point out once again how this game is not for the casual gamer due to the deep and complex systems that you must learn to manage through error to be victorious in militarily, economic or political means. The biggest advantage over Victoria 1 is the diplomacy this is more in depth and allows you to gain power by been wise and commanding of the world, instead of a rudimentary system where only alliances and basic trades are implemented. Most features of this game are easy to grasp at basic levels but to use them to their capacity a few games will have to be played to learn from the mistakes that you will undoubtedly do and suffer from. For most players the combat system in Victoria 2 is less complex than 1 I personally have not noticed much difference, however considering this game is about retaining power and control when it is slipping away from you been simpler is arguably the military commanders doing this. However for those who are to aggressive and don't exploit the other excellent features in the economic and diplomatic fields be warned of infamy. In my Victoria 1 review I talked about the outdated graphics, whilst I still stand about how they are unique and you will get used to them the graphics on Victoria 2 are much better and I do prefer them by no means is this an ugly game. Whilst impressive graphics are not included they do their job and are not key for a strategy game. Another improvement over Victoria 1 is the population control instead of just assigning roles you can also influence what gets built and who wins the elections in a far more complex system which fits the game. The fact you can play as any nation at the starting points allows replayability, but can you maintain your nations status or will you destroy the old powers? Build a new economic or military superpower which will have the old orders living in fear and the nations previously aligned to them at your will instead? Militarist, economist or diplomat? New or old order? The world can be your oyster but can you make it?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												   In Victoria II (1836-1936) you manage your country throughout the industrial revolution. The game engine feels dated because it lacks a lot of quality of life improvements and it doesn't look too pretty. Underneath the hood, there is a complex system that keeps track of the population in great complexity, and if there was a Nobel Prize for video games, then this game would've won it. But even if there is a lot of complexity underneath, you don't really have that many options with what you can do. The AI is not that great and is vulnerable to large military stacks. You can't have more than two great powers allied, and while this is a much too ""gamey"" mechanic for my taste, alongside ""crises"" that can appear, it can lead to a lot of volatile situations. In the end, the world can be a pretty dangerous and unforeseeable place. If you have a lot of states in your sphere of influence, then your game can transform in a very tedious mini-game to properly maintain and manage them, and of course you lack at least a proper notification system for it. Overall it's a good game, with good mods, which can keep you hooked for a long time, but it really makes you yearn for a Victoria III. Rating: But Mom, you promised me Italy! Recommendation: Are you into grand strategy games even if they look dated? Want to play a Paradox Interactive mega-campaign? http://pixelloot.com ",71,18,0,5,10,0,30

												Victoria II is a fantastic game. I'm a player of strategic games since 1992, there are more than 20 years of experience. I played games like Civilization I, II, III, IV, V, Call to Power, C-Evo, Freeciv, and others. With friends develop a mod for civilization IV over 5 years (Realism Invictus) and say that none of them made me so motivated. It was a great joy to have contact with a really challenging game. Imagine yourself in the following situation: reactionary rebels invaded the capital, conquering it. Deploy retrograde policies, reducing the social advances. The result of this dictatorship were more 80 years this scheme without the right to vote. Feel in the skin become a secondary country like Brazil from 1836 to a superpower. Make allies and engage in a major world war. Want more? Play Victoria II!Victoria II é um jogo fantástico. Sou jogador de jogos de estratégia desde de 1992, são mais de 20 anos de experiência.

												Had it for less than a week and already poured 39 hours into it. It is a seriously good game - well, if you enjoy these sorts of games, that is.50+ hours into it, and I'm still enjoying it (but playing other games now, mind you) and noting that there is a lot of replayability in it, be it through mods or just switching between the various available nations in the game.Want to form a communist state in Europe, or even the United States? Go for it. Want to create fascist states in Norway, Sweden or even Great Britain? Have fun. Or just interested in world conquest and the creation of an industrial super-power? Give it a try.The game has just about everything you need in it. A good game to play alongside Crusader Kings II or EUIV.I'd recommend it any day.			",150,10,1,23,16,3,26

												Have you seen my review for EUIV? If not, check it out now. Come on, I'll wait.Have you read it? Yes? Good. Now remember how it looks hard, but is easy to play once you've started? This is the opposite. If you've played EUIV, you expect this to be easy, and then your brain implodes. The amount of micromanagement is kind of scary. This is the game that convinced me that War Games (the movie set in the Cold War about the hacker), if it were ever to happen, would be Paradox's fault, most likely. It's still fun to play, but at some point you have to admit to yourself that you don't understand what half the buttons do, and you're okay with that.			",95,15,3,18,28,0,33

												1100 hours on record says it all, the game is fantastic but you should really use the POP-demand mod for maximum fun. the mod adds more decisions, nations, events, great wars and improved economy / crisis system. Overall you influence the nation but not in a way that wouldnt make sense, like you cant just decide '' I will go communist now and just roll with it, you have the population / upper house etc which all influence your nation.Naturally in terms of military it uses a simple but effective and fun system which is challanging but is easy to get in to, the game has massive replay value with many different nations, paths and formable nations ( like the Danubian Confederation, Germany, Arabia) which require certain conditions to archieve.The game is a massive challange and sometimes the game can turn ugly but if its for a discount i honestly recommend the game if you like crusader kings, Hearts of Iron or other massive RTS games. 9/10			",33,1,0,4,13,0,31

												Victoria 2 is one of my favourite games of all time. It's fun, has a high learning curve and shows huge potential. Some things are lacking and should be improved upon though.+ Great soundtrack+ A lot of countries to choose from. You can even play as Luxemburg...if you want.+ Fun and addicting gameplay.+ supports Mods that offer even more content+ High learning curve with a lot of payoff+ The DLCs are no rip-off like in other Paradox Games.- The crisis system, the political parties and the decisions needs to be worked on- The economy is somewhat broken.- No family tree- Annexing regions cost should be scaled and depend on each region's worth. Right now it isn't. Also, annexing remnant parts of a region should cost less if you already own other parts of it.- Recruiting and maintaining your unit stacks is a chore. This needs to be changed urgently. Make sure to get the DLCs ""Heart of Darkness"" and ""A House Divided"".Replay value: highRating: 9/10Recommendation: Yes			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Straight from the best in the Grand Strategy industry, Victoria II puts you on the throne of any nation in the world in 1836 and lets you do whatever the hell you want with the world. No winning, no losing (besides being annexed), no goals besides ones you make yourself. Does have some stupid bits (capitalists are literally as dumb as IRL) but these are minor in the game overall. Endless replayability, great mods, attention to detail, and ability to create the glorious Danube Federation gives this game a 9/10.			",32,5,0,4,16,1,15

												Victoria 2 is another RTS with a pause game from the fine folks at Paradox Interactive and set during the height of European colonial and Imperial power. Typically when you hear 'RTS' the first thing that pops into your mind are games like Command&Conquer and other simple 'point, click ,conquer' games where your simple goal is to win the war by any means or casualties necessary. Nothing wrong with that, but if that is the kind of strategy you enjoy you should stay far, far away from the far more realistic perspective that Victoria II offers.Typically Paradox games are never the same (though their somewhat simplistic map and interface might lead some to think they are just the same game in different period), with Crusader Kings series focusing on dynastic ambition, Europa Univeralis on amassing a massive Empire and Hearts of Iron on winning the World Wars. Victoria 2 falls into that golden sweet spot between Europa Universalis and Hearts of Iron where the history is already written. Some things are quite likely to happen no matter what you do: such as the Germanies being united by either Prussia, Austria or Bavaria. Liberalism will also gain strength around the world and the USA will emerge as a Great Power without peer.Other things though? Not quite so certain. You can easily cripple even the largest powerhouse such as the United Kingdom with an illtimed or ill-fought war that leads to hundreds of thousands of your precious Pops dying out; in essence crippling your industry and dooming you to a waiting game where you hope to recussitate your lagging economy. Thankfully the game has a deep, and I mean DEEP economy system which you can spend hours or even days simply trying to manipulate to become an economic powerhouse without peer. Some games are actually simply put games where you try to maximize your economic potential and gain a toehold in the global market and they can be just as fun and rewarding... or even more so than a traditional warfare approach.I could go onto rant about the depth, beauty and awesomness of Victoria II, but I figure I should sum this up somehow:+Incredibly deep and complex.+Lots of replay value.-Unpolished gem.-Graphics can be a turn off for some.

												For the price, this is an excellent game. My dissapointment was that the one great power who's capital is outside Europe, the United States, is not given much chance to influence factors outside of it's own continent. Expansion into the western portion of North America is heavily simplified and doesn't give you the feeling of manifest destiny that I was hoping for. Europe appears to be fine though, so if you're planning on uniting Germany under Prussia, it's probably A-OK and you won't have much trouble (An AI did it in my game). Although it adds tension, making every great power want to expand their influence at every opportunity can lead to scenarios where the tiniest infraction on someone (in my case, developing a reason to declare war on Hawaii as the U.S.) leads to situations such as a Great Britian who decided to ally mexico, declaring war on me. During that conflict, I had to fight a war on two fronts and Jacobin rebels spawned with about four times the army the Confederates fielded during the civil war. There was no hope to win after that.Overall, I wish it focused more on history and less on these strange scenarios that pop up every so often. On the other hand, if you're a fan of alternate history, you'll probably love this game. If the game is on sale, I recommend buying it with the DLC. Thanks for reading my review and have a good time.			",21,0,0,3,3,0,4

												I got into this game after playing the Total War series- I loved Rome 1 and Shogun but was a little disappointed by the other games and so wanted something new. I stumbled across Victoria 2 and as it was on a sale bought it thinking it looked interesting. Best decision ever. Although at first I had no idea what I was doing, after playing all the tutorials and picking a moderately sized country (Belgium- good industry and small so a good starting point, can get frustrating later on in the game because of its tiny military). I spent about 60-70 hours on this first play through and loved every second. The economics are so detailed, and political system is pretty complex and the whole game is very realistic. I then played a second campaign as Prussia, uniting the whole of Germany within 10 years and am now at 1928 as the top country in the world by several thousand points having won 5 Great Wars. My only issue with the game would be that the combat is still a bit of a mystery to me- I mostly just create huge stacks and hope. Otherwise this is an absolutely brilliant game which is well worth buying, especially if you see it on sale			",6,4,0,6,4,0,11

												Yeah it's alright.  Overwealming at first but due to a very intricate economical system that works well.  It's somewhat limited by it's time of the years 1836 to 1936, as a result a lot of the same things happen in every playthrough for the first half of the game, the flip side of the coin is that it has a sense of structure that holds up the sandbox element well.  There are some issues with the AI, most of which have been patched in the downloadable content if you're willing to pay for them.  It can be questionable to have a nationwide population of a few million and become delved into civil war against as many soldiers as your population, massacuring them and have them return unskaved to their factory jobs only to rebell once again.  It has a reasonably simple to understand military system, but in no way dumbed down.			",44,7,0,7,23,0,24

												Another guide by Gaius Julius CeasarWell to start it off this game was on my wishlist for a little while, it seemed to be a game that I wanted the total war series to be like. Victoria II however exeeded all of the expectations it had. The game is much more political than the total war series, the conquest is also different from the total war series, as I am still trying to master sending armies over seas! ( that makes playing as Great Britain impossible, shame but once I learn how to Britain here I come! ) You also can conquer ( sorry my English is not my strongest point ) more territory, with each country having around 14 or more provinces and the whole world being right there for the taking you will find yourself drawn into the game and struggling to get out! Another thing is you do not find any settlements to take over, you just move a army into the province and wait, this is different from the total war series yet again.I believe I should also mention that there is no end turn... Every country gets to make their choice of what happens at the same time you do, so if you are expecting a total war end button thing then do not, I was and it took me a while to realize that there is something in the top left corner with a pause button on it, once you click that you can use the + and - signs to change the speed of what happens, and because everything happens together it makes it much harder to plan something, because when you move to attack one army they could move to attack yours! I hope you buy the game and enjoy it as much as what I did.Yours Sincerly Gaius Julius Ceasar ",23,4,0,15,7,0,13

												Victoria 2 is a next level of depth for a game that I had no idea was possible. Everything from encouraging a certain type of job in some far off tiny colony in Africa to managing your country's economy is possible along with everything in between. This is not just a map simulator, but more of a world simulator. Not appeasing the public's will will bring rebellions and will shift the balance of your government. You can go from having a war-happy nation to one that cuts itself off from the world because your population drastically shifted their vote due to you gaining too much infamy or not passing a policy reform that 2+ million people wanted. This game is for people that love to do nothing but micro-manage on a large scale. The conquering of countries and waging wars is the fun side of this game, but what really creates another level of realism is managing your country like a true president/dictator/king would.

												Where to begin?First off, this game is amazing, it has an in depth view of governmental structure, population management, and economics.All these things combined assist in creating one of the most detailed strategy games of all time.Secondly, mods for this game are brilliant, they help bring new factors into the game.Such as WW2 or even modern day geopolitics,these come with new challenges but they still stay true to the game at heart.Lastly, the alternate history of this game is so pleasing. Whether it be France conquering all of Prussia or the US expanding out across both Americas, it is just a treat.All in all, I'd give this game a solid 10/10.I feel that even if there were tons of bugs, I'd still adore this game's content and experience. Its very well polished and even though it does have some odd moments (walking from Paris to Delhi instead of taking a ship), it is still a fun game to get immersed into, especially if you loooooooooooooove spreadsheets!

												Vic2 was my second exposure to historical strategy sim games.  EUIII was my first try and it does not trip my trigger.  I usually play in north america.  CSA succeeds in splitting off.  When I first got the game, Great Britain would eventually take territory from USA, but updates seem to have changed that behavior.  The aspects of Vicky that I like are:1.  rebel uprisings.  They can make you hustle.  But you can beat them by watching the level of unrest and if necessary mobilizing troops.2. national focus.  What you choose will affect how the game plays out.  Choose to promote immigration and populaton will grow.  Choose a political focus, and you may have fewer rebellions.3. north america-  this is my home and the states are familiar to me, as is the history.  So I like playing in north america.4. anti-imperialism - the game is set up for imperialists, since the era was imperialistic.  But you don't have to play it that way.  The ai is imperialistic, so every one of your neighbors will try to eat your lunch, but you can play them  off against each other via alliances.  And of course you need good border defenses.5.  modding- Big mods are hard but mini-mods are easy.  Just (using the mod folder) change the lua file.  For example, I don't like all the time spent on research, so I changed all research (for all countries) to one day in the lua file. I also cranked up the militancy for captured territories (ha!)  And I changed the end date of the game.6.  policy choices-if you don't pick the reforms with eye on public opinion, you will get into trouble.7. budget- this can be tricky but if you are sensible you can avoid bankruptcy.8. economy- this is more for watching than messing with.  Lots of computing seems to go into the choices made by shadowy capitalists.  But also you need to cancel subsidies now and then or your budget will suffer.I recommend the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you are looking for a REALISTIC alternate history game, then this is one of the best games out there. The breadth and extant of this game are incomparable. However, that said, there are several words of advice I have:1. To fully enjoy this game, you must have the Pops Of Darkness modifier. This modifier takes a good game and makes it much better.2. The US political system is not very accurate. There should be a seperate system for the US, in the sense of that no political system available accurately represents the United States. Democracy in this game is based upon the British system of non-set elections, multiple parties, etc. The United States has always had set elections and a two-party system. It is hard to play as the United States in the political sense as a result. 3. The game should have been extended in time frame. An earlier start, such as 1776, would be more accurate, or even earlier, possibly as early as British unification. By the time the game commences, the United Kingdom is extremely dominant in the global sphere; countries such as Spain and Sweden are shadows of themselves, the best colonial lands are already taken (in the Americas and southern Africa), and if you are playing as Germany, Italy, or Japan, it is quite difficult to get even a small fraction of British power and influence. An earlier start would leave much colonial land open (particulary in North and South America, as well as Australasia), and some smaller powers (such as the Netherlands or Sweden), would have a fair shot at becoming dominant internationally.4. Immigration seems to need some adjustments, particulary when it comes to Chinese and Japanese migrations. Although China and Japan were not civilized, massive Chinese immigration to the United States began in the 1850's. Even with these countries becoming civilized, there is essentially no migration from non White nations to the Americas. Furthermore, decisions should be written in, to represent the Chinese exclusion acts.5. Some political correctness needs to be written out of the game. In other words, there should be decisions that allow for forcible population transfers. The Jews were often expelled from European countries, and like the Trail of Tears decision in the United States, many other minority groups have been forcibly moved throughout history. This is not a ""politically correct"" historical fact, but it is a fact.6. On the same note, there should be decisions that allow for freed slaves to be expelled. Historically, Liberia and Sierra Leone were founded for ex-slaves, and Pres. Lincoln of the United States debated in sending freedmen to Belize or Africa. Overall, this is a great game. These developers spent massive hours in research, and it shows. That said, even the best games can use some tweaks, and a project of this scale is no exception.			",2,0,0,4,1,0,4

												Victoria II like most grand strategy games from Paradox is very time consuming but also very fun. The game by itself is very fun and very playable however before the HOD dlc was added you could just declare war on anyone whenever you wished * yes you took a infamy hit but it still felt to easy to just go to war * With that being said the HOD dlc adds a feature where you have to wait a certain amount of time 90-365 days to justify going to war with a country. With the crisis system added with the DLC it really makes you think about who you want to get caught up in an alliance with because when one of your great powers allies or you get caught up in a conflict every great power is dragged into it no one is safe. * You can chose not to take part in the conflict but you will end up taking a massive hit * all in all I'd give it a 10/10Pro's - very fun- Great way to change how history plays out- You get cant get enoughCon's-♥♥♥♥♥♥ rebellion - Little but of a learning curve * not to bad *			",93,6,1,11,16,0,25

												(VICTORIA 2 IS MY FAVORITE GRAND STRATEGY GAME)I know Paradox is talking about making the 3rd one after Hearts of Iron 4...MAKE  THE 3rd VICKY already! Not a 4th Hearts of Iron. >:(There is all these awesome mods for HOI3 but for Victoria 2 not so much.I love Victoria 2 and I love playing as Republic of Texas and I love the game mechicanes, but it feels very limited, they're are some bugs still, and you really can't mod it that well.I believe Victoria 3 should get a new engine where you can mod more...

												This game is one of My favorite games that I have ever played. It is an incredibly complex game to learn. However once you learn how to manage your economy, how to become a great of secondary power, and how to manage your military properly this game just feels right. The way you control your nation just feels right. However this game is far from flawless. Here are some of the problems that I experienced in the game. When I First started this game up it crashed on the loading screen.However I found a solution to this game breaking glitch. First you go to your files. Next go to OS, then program files (x86), next go to steam, then SteamApps, commmon, then go into Victoria 2,( I would suggest making a shortcut)Go into map, then cache, delete all the files in the cache folder but not to folder itself. It is fixed.The aircraft in this game is treated like soldiers which is just stupid, because you cannot fly over enemy territory and cannot destroy enemy structures. Also you cannot fly overseas. You could have at least make them look like actual aircraft.The province occupation system is wierd. How can it take over 100 days to occupy a small province like for example Frankfurt, with over 15k soldiers?There are still some more flaws in this game that I can't remember.However with or without flaws this game is amazing and still has a tonne of potential.If only the developers would recognise the potential that this game has to offer and continue working on it.

												one of the best Paradox games. it covers a period not often shown, and with an accuracy and depth of choice that encourage strategic play. the economic system is extemely difficult to understand, and for most players, is best left to run itself, but if you're feeling confident, a planned economy can be powerful. most of the time, players will try to be good members of the international community but later on when great wars and new technologies become available, an ambitious player has the potential to really go crazy. unlike most paradox games, where everything gets easier over time, your country is always balanced. small countries are harder to play of course, but even well developed great powers require skilled play to do more than a little map painting. not for everyone, but I recommend it without hesitation to anyone willing to invest some time into a more complex grand strategy game.

												This is one of my true favourites when it comes to Paradox games. They're in general similar, but with differences. In EU it's the renaissance era progress towards centralized states, so much will be about land, army and navy, in CK you have your family tree and it's alot about breeding, HoI is more total war than anything else, but this game I consider to be the most complex of them all. It's not just the buildning of an army/navy and eventually air force, but also about infrastructure, industrialization, colonies, and your population. Your population aren't homogenous, not only does it consist of differnt national groups, but there's catholics, protestants and jews, there's clerks, farmers, soldiers and capitalists, and then on top they all have their own political view on things. Now, different choices you make will also alter parameters here, so it will change over time, and also does so according to events and things happening in the world as a whole. Governing a nation will also be alot about channeling these things into forming a nation, or strengthening a existing one. In the end, it usually funnels out into the Great War.So, if you like the time of industrialization,  and if you like complexity, this is the game for you. I most definetly recommend it.

												Paradox sale first timers, please be advised that the €12 purchase is an absolute must if you want to enjoy Victoria 2 to its fullest potential. That price will get you one of the finest titles Paradox has ever produced, even without the plethora of excellent mods put out by the community you will be able to find countless hours of enjoyment from this game.The learning curve and the archaïc user interface might scare off people who are entirely new to grand strategy but the beauty of Victoria 2 is that in the 100 years you are given, you are completely free to do whatever you want. Running a country into the ground to help you understand the basics is a downright fun experience if you do it right (See how fast you can get the South to secede! Have the North secede! Who cares, it's the 19th century!) and from there on out you can set your own goals, you can even play with your friends.If you decide to make a purchase worth your while, do stop by /r/paradoxplaza on reddit, the community there partakes in campaign memoires writing sessions (also known as After Action Reports), we would be delighted to hear about your experiences!

												Victoria II is a truly unique grand strategy game, one that goes in depth into everything. While some may find the economics system confusing, it can be handled in a timely manner by moving a few sliders around, or in the long run, adjusting every tiny thing as you go along. Wars, while an important part of the game and expanding your nation, are not the main focus of the game, but rather keeping a stabilized country. To go to war is not only to expand your borders, but to expand your economy and influence in a region. Civil wars and revolts may occur if you are not in a stable position, unfortunately caused because of liberals, your lack of assimilation in a region, or the people of your proud nation want changed policies.I would recommend this great grand strategy game to anyone who enjoys a game of its type, be it a fascination with the countries in it, the type of game, or both.

												EDIT:  Now that I've spent some time(91 hours) playing this game, I feel I can give a better review.  This isn't an easy game. It takes time, sweat, blood, toil, tears, and other bodily fluids that you may have. But it is worth it. Don't expect an Age of Empires kind of game. You will most likely lose a lot before you even begin to win. Winning is everything, whether to you it is building the Suez canal or forming Arabia, but no matter the goal, there is no sweeter taste than reaching it in this game. It is rewarding, but you'll have to work for it. Buy it for a challenge, but don't buy it if you want to play something easy. This is a strategy game in every sense of the word.			",3,2,0,1,12,0,10

												Welcome to the age of Imperialism and Empire. Wether you take control of a current great power; or raise an uncivilized nation to greatness, this game never gets boring and always has new challenges and events that will always keep you on the edge of your seat with excitment. Pros:- Astounding gameplay- Spectacular World Map- Always a different experienceCons:- Numbers glitch out when you get too many troops- A few crashes here and thereAll around Victoria II gets a 9/10. This game is absoultely worth your money if you like strategy games. Thank you for taking the time to read this,King George Washington			",19,0,0,0,4,0,7

												Ever wanted to start your own empire in the 19th and early 20th Centuries? Well now you can, In Victoria 2! My personal favourite of the Paradox Grand Strat games.Just remember to get the DLC 'A House Divided' and 'Heart Of Darkness', Trust me, it'll save alot of headaches in the long run.The game has a quite steep learning curve; which presents itself as severe information overload however I'd recommend playing as a smaller/more isolated nation such as the US, Belgium or spain to learn the ropes. Once you get the hang of it the game is great fun for any fan of grand strat games or even fans of the Victorian era.			",141,37,5,29,33,2,45

												I think it's time I write my first real review of a steam game--and I'm happy to make it this one.Victoria II has a steep learning curve, but if you open yourself up: it's easy and addicting.The attraction to Victoria II is not its asthetics, it's its offering to let you take on a whole new history.Victoria II plops you into 1836, right before the crowning of Queen Victoria and at the height of the British Empire. The Hapsburg Monarchy still rules the Austrian Empire and Germany is still divided into many small states. The Tsars rule over the Russian Empire that still seeks its greatest extents and America is not even 100 years old.  France emerges from the Napoleonic wars in defeat but a new spring is just around the corner. The Ottoman Empire is the ""sick man of Europe"" but with the right leadership can embrace the new age with renewed vitality.And even more nations await emergence: Japan, China, and of course the oncoming rush for Africa will change the face of the world.Any nation is playable in Victoria II. Even more can be released or formed. Almost every game is different.War isn't the focus here. Though it is an intriguing aspect. What will draw you in: is the diplomacy.Now that may sound boring but pay in mind the dynamics here. Although the great powers rule and may keep you in-check, playing as one (or better-yet, using them to your advantage to gain power) will keep you thrilled.The Great powers of the time compete to influence other, smaller nations. Intricate webs of alliances and spheres can easily turn a localized conflict into a world war.Crises over disputed territories can cause Great Powers to go at-odds, lobbying other powers to join their side in the tension-packed period where the world can drift into destructive war.Later in the game, these can mean ""great wars"" were defeat can mean total decimation.In fact, each country is only one war-gone-bad from collapse.Compete to establish puppet states who will obey your every whim.Sphere nations to earn off their industry and almost garantee their support.Colonize the unsettled worlds of Africa, the Pacific, and North America. Keep other nations from doing the same.Also there are different civilization levels. Primitive, Uncivilized, partially civilized, and civilized. Depending on what stage your in impacts your ability to function as a state as your technology will be way behind, you won't be able to build industries, ect. until you ""westernize"" and join the world as a modern-style nation-state.This alone can be fun as you struggle to survive in the old ways or fight against your own people who resist your attempts to change their very culture.Warfare itself is more fleshed-out than initially realized. Your armies' ability to do recconassaince, perform sieges, and fight in battle is dependent upon their specilized unit makeup and perhaps too-often ignored: their generals.An army of 80,000 draftees can be thrawted by a smaller, diverse professional army and an excellently-chosen general who can earn fame by winning battles which will in-turn provide greater bonuses.Naval power is a MUST to establish yourself as a colonial power. Blockades can WRECK your trade. And just as with armies: diversity and excellent Admirals can win you the day.Trade itself can be largely ignored and should be automated unless you feel otherwise inclined.Politics within your own country can grab your attention.The availible government types are:DemocracyHM's GovernmentPrussian ConstitutionalismAbsolute MonarchyProletarian DictatorshipFascist DictatorshipBorgeouseis DictatorshipPresidential Dictatorship.To better understand this, the political party in power decides your trade policy, your tax policy, your military spending, how you treat minorities, ability to intervene/control factories and industry, and your upper house (legislative body) will decide what reforms you can impliment.Democracies are governments where the party in power is elected and they guide policy until the next election.HM's Government are the same but you have the ability to change the government in power (though reforms will require the appropriate members in said upper house). Prussian Constitutionalism is this wierd grey-area between Absolute Monarchies and Democracies though usually have elections.Absolute Monarchies have no elections (which by the way are totally annoying and only nudge public opinion especially in large countries) and can choose the ruling party.Then come the dictatorships which are usually single-party.THE BEST PART IS YOU GET DIFFERENT FLAGS DEPENDING ON YOUR GOVERNMENTSOMETIMES DIFFERENT NAMES.An example is Mexico who, if they have a monarch, will change to the Empire of Mexico.The United Kingdom will change to Great Britain if a democracy or the People's Commonwealth if a proletarian dictatorship,These will also cause flag changes.Rebels will lobby for reform changes or even radical government change. Sometimes you might want them to win. There's nothing wrong with letting the generals plot a dictator's downfall.Now finally mods which really can give a lot of replayability to this game.Mods are relatively easy to get though are not taken from the steam workshop but from websites like Moddb.These mods have infinite potential offering different timelines, scenerios, new nations, new flags, new alternate timelines.Some even add events to the more minor nations to make them more dynamic to play. OHONE MORE THINGMultiplayer IS possible, don't worry. And trust me, it's awesome with friends.You can coordinate to carve up continents for your empires.You can plot against each-other. A great game is Austria and Prussia competing for dominance.Here's how we do it:Download Hamachi which will allow you to create a network your friends can connect to.They will use the Hamachi-provided IP address the host of the network has to connect to your game.It's advised to put the game to save often. We do half-years.Make sure you verify the integrity of your game cache every time you play together. And close out of the game entirely if someone crashes and do so again just to be sure.You MUST have the same version to operate.If you want to load saves, the host (and only the host) needs to disable their firewalls.another thing: the Host should host the hamachi network AND the multiplayer game.We haven't tried mods yet.To conclude this review, make sure you invest into this game (and hope someday for another Paradox game that picks up where this one leaves off--1939 or somewhere around that era). It may seem overwhelming at first, but attack and google around if you're lost. Usually you can find a forum post where they have your question or you can start your own.Find friends to join the game with you.Take pictures. f12. ",34,4,0,8,12,0,19

Manage your nations production, dyplomacy, economy and crush your enemies in war in this wild world of 19th century. Colonise Africa, form great empire, and survive The Great War.Game is really fun to play, but it's not for everyone. You need a while to get this game right, it's kinda complicated.

Your armies' ability to do recconassaince, perform sieges, and fight in battle is dependent upon their specilized unit makeup and perhaps too-often ignored: their generals.An army of 80,000 draftees can be thrawted by a smaller, diverse professional army and an excellently-chosen general who can earn fame by winning battles which will in-turn provide greater bonuses.Naval power is a MUST to establish yourself as a colonial power. Blockades can WRECK your trade. And just as with armies: diversity and excellent Admirals can win you the day.Trade itself can be largely ignored and should be automated unless you feel otherwise inclined.Politics within your own country can grab your attention.The availible government types are:DemocracyHM's GovernmentPrussian ConstitutionalismAbsolute MonarchyProletarian DictatorshipFascist DictatorshipBorgeouseis DictatorshipPresidential Dictatorship.To better understand this, the political party in power decides your trade policy, your tax policy, your military spending, how you treat minorities, ability to intervene/control factories and industry, and your upper house (legislative body) will decide what reforms you can impliment.Democracies are governments where the party in power is elected and they guide policy until the next election.HM's Government are the same but you have the ability to change the government in power (though reforms will require the appropriate members in said upper house). Prussian Constitutionalism is this wierd grey-area between Absolute Monarchies and Democracies though usually have elections.Absolute Monarchies have no elections (which by the way are totally annoying and only nudge public opinion especially in large countries) and can choose the ruling party.Then come the dictatorships which are usually single-party.THE BEST PART IS YOU GET DIFFERENT FLAGS DEPENDING ON YOUR GOVERNMENTSOMETIMES DIFFERENT NAMES.An example is Mexico who, if they have a monarch, will change to the Empire of Mexico.The United Kingdom will change to Great Britain if a democracy or the People's Commonwealth if a proletarian dictatorship,These will also cause flag changes.Rebels will lobby for reform changes or even radical government change. Sometimes you might want them to win. There's nothing wrong with letting the generals plot a dictator's downfall.Now finally mods which really can give a lot of replayability to this game.Mods are relatively easy to get though are not taken from the steam workshop but from websites like Moddb.These mods have infinite potential offering different timelines, scenerios, new nations, new flags, new alternate timelines.Some even add events to the more minor nations to make them more dynamic to play. OHONE MORE THINGMultiplayer IS possible, don't worry. And trust me, it's awesome with friends.You can coordinate to carve up continents for your empires.You can plot against each-other. A great game is Austria and Prussia competing for dominance.Here's how we do it:Download Hamachi which will allow you to create a network your friends can connect to.They will use the Hamachi-provided IP address the host of the network has to connect to your game.It's advised to put the game to save often. We do half-years.Make sure you verify the integrity of your game cache every time you play together. And close out of the game entirely if someone crashes and do so again just to be sure.You MUST have the same version to operate.If you want to load saves, the host (and only the host) needs to disable their firewalls.another thing: the Host should host the hamachi network AND the multiplayer game.We haven't tried mods yet.To conclude this review, make sure you invest into this game (and hope someday for another Paradox game that picks up where this one leaves off--1939 or somewhere around that era). It may seem overwhelming at first, but attack and google around if you're lost. Usually you can find a forum post where they have your question or you can start your own.Find friends to join the game with you.Take pictures. f12. ",34,4,0,8,12,0,19

												Great startegic game about cotrolling ANY country existing in times from 1836 to 1936 . Manage your nations production, dyplomacy, economy and crush your enemies in war in this wild world of 19th century. Colonise Africa, form great empire, and survive The Great War.Game is really fun to play, but it's not for everyone. You need a while to get this game right, it's kinda complicated.

												Overall my favorite Paradox title: more balanced gameplay than CK2 and better economic simulation than EU4, but you can actually do things besides war, unlike HoI. The two main DLC, Heart of Darkness and A House Divided drastically improve the game, and many concur that they are effectively mandatory to make the game enjoyable. Also, with mods, you can genocide people - and everyone loves genocide!			",54,2,1,7,7,0,12

												Paradox Interactive must be the masters of Strategy games. This is one of their finest. Victoria II is set in the Victorian Era in the 19th and early 20th century. From 1836 to 1936, you have 100 years to lead a nation to triumph. There are no official goals in the game. You make the goals. But the de-facto prospect is making a country into an economic or military superpower. Some nations like Great Britain are already big at the start, but playing a small nation like Greece can give you the opportunity to give it a time it never saw. That's right. You're not playing history. You're re-writing it. Every little thing you do in the game can have big, unintentional outcomes. Doing something in North America might somehow cause a war in Europe. You never know.This is just how fun Victoria II is for history buffs. You can play unlikely countries and turn them into a colonial superpowers. I played Ireland and gave it African colonies. I claimed the island of Hawaii for Mexico, preventing the USA from annexing it in actual history. I played the Confederate States of America and fought hard for it's independence and giving it colonies around the world. There is just so much you can do. So many opportunities.But while that sounds like a lot of fun, you're going to have to work hard to achieve your goals. This game has a huge learning curve. In fact, I was almost turned off by the game when playing it for the first time because of how complex it was. But learning is the fun part. I didn't spend a lot of time with the tutorial. I just played around and learned as played. Right now, I know how this game works. But I'm still learning. As I said before, you have to work hard. There's a lot of things to do when managing a country. Here are those things.- You have to manage taxes and government spending. Some countries might have to rely on heavy taxing on the poor, middle and rich if the government lacks a lot of money in their bank. You might also have to cut down on military and infastructure spending to rake in cash. If you are in serious decline of money, you can borrow funds from the bank. But you will have to repay those debts. Some nations have the population and profits to not worry about funding. But other small nations will.-Economy management. You might have to open factories to gain profits. Depending on your country's economic policy. You can open factories or let the AI capitalists do them for you. These factories needs craftsmen and whatever resources the factories need. And let's talk about that next.-Resources. This is the fun part. Let's face it. Some nations don't have everything they need. A small country like Texas (which lacks a big population and resources) might have to go to war and conquer weaker nations to prosper. Colonies help boost the resources and pops you need. -War. It's not the primary focus of the game, but it's a whole lot of fun. War is not the goal. War helps your goals. As mentioned before, you might need to start a war to conquer a nation/colony for more resources. Or you might go to war to establish a puppet-state which acts like a permanent alliance. Whatever suits your agenda, War can help you.-Diplomacy. Okay, it's not really the intriguing part but politics and international relations is what makes things more interesting in Vic 2. If you want to survive, you might need to make a few friends when making more enemies.- Technological advancement. You got a century to run a country and while years go by, new technologies will be available for you to develop. This is how a country will improve and become stronger. Military, Naval, Commerce, Culture and Industry are the 5 tech trees you can develop on the way. Culture, industry and Commerce might be important for nations that are just sitting around, but warmongers might like Military and Naval much more better. All 5 of the trees are important however, so don't try and pick the military ones only.-Politics. Oh man, sometimes the hardest part of running the nation is how to deal with your citizens. If you're a democracy, people are gonna have vote for their favorite political party. And each political party that could be in power, will affect your nation. Hell, if you're population manages to vote the Communist Party in, you might accidently have caused your country to be a dictatorship. If you're not managing your country well, rebellions can happen and if you can't fight off the rebellions with your military, you might be running a new government soon. You can also make political and social reforms like voting policies or whether or not the minimum wage should be lower.-Colonization. This is the best part of Victoria II. There are several uncolonized parts of the world. Not that they lack populations but that there are no established nations there. Australia & New Zealand are mostly uncolonized with the exception of a few provinces. But most likely, Britain will do inevitably colonize them. North America will be the only continent to be fully colonized quickly. There are unclaimed land that the United States, Mexico or Britain will grab before the 1850's. But the glory of colonization occurs in Africa. Most of the continent is unclaimed. There's only a few nations and small colonial settlements that exist. -Modernization. Europe, in this time period has the technology that is top of the line. So most of the world is somewhat behind compared to Europe. So if you're playing a country in Africa or Asia, you will want to spend some time modernizing. Japan is the pretty much the only country in the game that modernizes so quickly. But not only that, you get to turn Japan into a colonial superpower faster than any other country that hasn't westernized. While I did not mention everything, there is just so much you can do. Key historical events like the American Civil War can occur when the time is ready. You can also install mods that improve the gameplay experience. The New Nations Mod adds countries that the developers should have added before. I definitely recommend Victoria II for anyone who is into strategy games and history in general. 10/10 ",103,12,3,5,9,1,19

												Victoria 2 is an absolute masterpiece. I find this game to be one of paradox's best game as of yet. The game has great mechanics that constantly have me engaged when playing. Modding the game is also really fun because I can create almost anything and change anything. I highly recommend this game for people who love history and strategy video games.

												There are few games set in the 1800s, but this one does it well. You take control of any country - from Great Britain to Ethiopia - for one hundred years, starting in 1836 and spanning the American Civil War and Franco-Prussian War, as well as many other wars. For each country, there are many, many options - in fact, the only ""quest"" that the game gives you is to survive until 1936. The main reason why someone would not like this game is if they need more guidance, but personally I like it, and most grand strategy players will too.			",29,2,0,2,20,0,26

												Do you like spreadsheets? What about the endless waiting and worrying over external threats that comes from the futility of contemplating one's existance as a less developed country? In all seriousness, Victoria II is a great game, and stands as one of the most solid Paradox developed games. If you are just getting into the Grand Strategy genre after playing Crusader Kings II or Europa Universalis IV, then some features may be intimidating at first. There is micromanaging present in both of those games, but probably not to the extent that you are likely to experience when playing Vicky. Like all Paradox games there is a pretty steep learning curve, but this should not discourage you as there are loads of helpful tutorials online.You will almost surely start the game try to learn the game as a fairly small nation and end up getting crushed by some event that will seem quite obvious down the line. Try Brazil if you are just starting out. They are a fairly easy nation for learning the base mechanics (using some gamey tactics to take easy uncivilized nations in Africa), but offer a nice challenge in the late game as one usually ends up competing for regional supremacy with the USA.If you're still not convinced, here are some cool things that I have seen during some of my playthroughs:Japan won a war against the Ottomon Empire, and ended up controlling the Hejaz including the holy cities of Mecca and Medina.USA POPs revolted and left the USA controlling only the western portion of the country. The Confederates controlled the South, while the Free States of America controlled the north and had replaced the USA as the continental Great Power.Poland was released in a Great War and promptly proceeded to take up boundaries almost exactly proportional to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.PROS:1. Maps are nice to look at.2. The unstoppable historical events (think the Mongol invasions of CK2, to a lesser extent) add a structure to the madness that is a Grand Strategy game.3. It is fun to take historically insignificant entities and create a narrative that establishes them as being a dominant power.CONS:1. State control of the means of production ends up feeling like a spreadsheet simulator.2. Game slows down considerably in later years and is especially slow on a lot of laptops.3. You will probably 100x more games than you actually finish			",65,29,2,25,24,0,10

												Best Paradox game ever made.Combine the following games: Democracy, CK2 and Hearts of Iron 3.I used to be a Hearts of Iron 3 addict, and still go back to it a bit, from time to time, when the urge strikes me to conquer the world as Germany or turn everybody into a slave as USSR.But this... Vicky2 models your population - various people can do various jobs.Want to go to war?  Fine, recruit your soldiers.... but will that leave enough to work your factories?Meanwhile you must juggle internal politics (this is one of the few games that gets this right) balancing between need for reform (if any) and people pushing back against it.And of course there are the nations around you, just waiting for that one slip to destroy you.You can lose a war, but losing your national rank in this game hurts a lot more, as great powers, and even secondary powers have many advantages over nations with less worldwide respect.This game is the pinnacle of the Paradox studios.This game is the pinnacle of strategy.This is on par with Distant Worlds, if not better.

												The most interesting of all the Paradox Interactive games. This game does not require you to be a war-monger. This game does not require you to micromanage silly family members. Rather, this game lets you have an extreme challenge by simply maintaining your nation and ideology through some incredible changes in technology and politics. You can also wage a lot of wars without ever expanding your own territory - instead, you simply seek to liberate countries and maintain a democratic, fascist, monarchist, or socialist world order. Even if all you want to do is build up your own little country and develop lots of heavy industry, while maintaining neutrality in the various Great Wars that start happening, that is still challenging and fun.

												I recommend this game, for it is strangely addicting.The flexibility and customization of this game is awesome. You can control which ever country you would like, and run a nation according to your own visions of what it should be, and build an empire according to this.It's just amazing. Those who enjoy games such as Risk should fall in love with this game.The only issue I have, is that it can be quite buggy at times and I have had one or two crashes every now and then, although the three autosave system it has compensates for this most of the time so I do not lose any significant progress on the odd time this does happen.Overall, I would rate it a 7.5/10. If some of the bugs were fixed, I would rate it an 8.5/10.			",79,10,1,16,27,2,29

												If you're into grand strategy games, then this is a perfect game for you. Victoria II allows the player to play as any country founded before 1836 and continue to play as them until 1936 where the game ends.  There is the aspect of micromanaging  where the player has to control their economy, army, navy, research, etc. There is a steep learning curve but once you get how to play, the game is real simple. The pace of the game is moderate (singleplayer games take about 4 hours on normal, Multiplayer takes a couple of days).  The two DLC for the game makes gameplay much better but if your trying to play with other then they need the DLC as well.  The only problem with this game is starting multiplayer games. The only way for me and my friends to play together is to have Hamachi up and me port-forwarded. Other then that, the game is great for anyone who likes grand strategy.			",89,11,2,6,45,1,30

												To keep the review short, this game will challenge you.In order to enjoy it, as I do, you either need to be a large history fan of the era (1830's to 1910's) or a great fan of grand strategy games, Paradox games in particular.Victoria II is not held as highly rated as EU or CK2 and I can see why as it seems a lot more limiting. HOWEVER saying that it (just as with all paradox games I have played) is a stunningly well made and authentic title and has improved hugely from the first Victoria game. It can be complex as it is highly political but you soon learn to just build a ton of factories and help the capitalists and aristocrats if you want to succeed.A political grand strategy game not a military one. Possibly the best of its kind. Fantastic game highly recommended.			",56,5,0,10,6,0,17

												This game is a masterpiece.Where other Paradox games, amazing as they are, can end up feeling like you're always either at war or preparing for war Victoria II's amazing degree of detail when it comes to simulating your country's population along with the lovely though sometimes broken economy system and unique attention to politics for a strategy game means that not just war but also peace is interesting and you will make plans for things to do in peace the same way you would plan for wars in the other games.That said the warfare in this game does not suffer and remains on a comparable level to that of other Paradox games but now interacts in new ways with your peace time efforts due to the simulating of the population.Aside from the amazing gameplay this game has Andreas Waldetoft's usual amazing music and although the map is somewhat dated it is definitely not bad and conveys information very well Along with the rest of the graphics this all comes together to give the game that Victorian era feel.

												This is the best game ever, no contest whatsoever. You lead a country through the era of colonialism (This is when we enslaved everyone that wasn't white. And the Irish.) and lead your nation to become the greatest power in the world. Of course you could play as one of the many nations of uncivilised brown people but who gives a toss about the filthy mudskins, not the good old British Empire, thats who! This game makes me feel warm in my special parts, after having to listen to all this social justice drivel it was fun to be rewarded for having white privilige. And by being rewarded I mean murdering and enslaving all non-whites because there is no better way to civilise the unwashed masses than with naval bombardment and Expeditionary Forces, of course you aren't supposed to kill other white pople though because that upsets everyone so make sure you load up a boat with some Guardsmen and send them to Africa so they can do their part for the White Man's Burden.

												Oh God, I can't believe that I haven't reviewed this game yet.As I write this, I have 437.3 hrs on record--making this the most played game in my library.-----Victoria II is a game that starts in 1836 and ends in 1936. So 100 years of gameplay. This is one of Paradox's faster paced games, as years can go by very quickly depending on the speed and how you manage that time. In my case, I only play as challenging nations like: Texas, Hawaii, Bali, Nejd, Ionian Islands, Mecklenburg, and Cuba. I find joy in trying to turn a small nation into a successful empire. This usually takes many years to do, however.- Population: The main difference I can list right off the bat, compared to other Paradox titles, is that this game focuses on your population. Your population is comprised of: Farmers, labourers, craftsmen, soldiers, officers, clerks, slaves, and other professions. Naturally, if you want armies, you need soldiers. If you want to become rich, you must employ more workers into your factories, and more labourers into the fields. It's very important to keep your population content with your government, or they may revolt. Many may find revolts tedious and annoying, but I for one believe that revolts are one of the most crucial parts to the game. And I will explain why momentarily.- Politics: While a game like Hearts of Iron III has politics, there isn't much depth to it. You really have little control over what political party rises in Hearts of Iron III. In Victoria 2, your population plays a major role in what political party is elected (assuming that they are allowed to vote!) This game contains 7 different political factions: Liberals, conservatives, anarcho-liberals, reactionaries, socialists, communists, and fascists. Of the 7, I always go socialist--as I am very familiar with this system. Along with the political parties, you can combine this with different types of governments. There are monarchies, democracies, dictatorships (and proletarian dictatorships for the communists.) The best part about government changes, is that the flag of a nation will change as well. For example; if Germany turned into a proletarian dictatorship, they would receive the flag of the DDR. While if they turned into a fascist dictatorship, they acquire the flag of the Third Reich (Kind of...) I love the political aspect of this game, and it is likely the one reason I constantly play this game.- Revolts: As I said, these are usually annoying to you in two ways. 1. They may be attacking your country. 2. They may be attacking a puppet/ally, and thus will tear your ties with that nation if overthrown. Now, on the other hand, rebels are truly what makes the game interesting. The Russians are defeated BADLY in a war, and communist rebels rise. They overthrow the Russian Empire and form the Soviet Union. If you ask me, that's pretty damn interesting! After 80 years of seeing the same old Russian Empire, it's nice seeing them throw out the red color and put on the classic hammer and sickle. How about Scottish rebels? Is it not interesting to see Scotland gain independence from the United Kingdom through violent means? There's both pros and cons to rebels. I personally have NO PROBLEM with rebels, ever. I just choose the socialist party loyalty national focus on my nation, let my nation turn more red, and I seem to be in good hands. Otherwise, if the rebels want to fight, I will go Rocky IV on them. So in other words... I love rebels.- The scramble for Africa: This is such a fun part of the game, but I feel that it mainly improved with the addition of the Heart of Darkness DLC. Throughout your game, you will notice that Africa is a mere wasteland of uncolonized land. There is generally nothing interesting that surrounds Africa until the 1870s, when the doors are unlocked and all great and secondary powers are given the green light to begin colonization. It's nothing short of a big race. Everyone wants to get their hands on the most land, and if you plan things out accordingly (like perhaps annexing Liberia before 1870) you can form a massive African empire. What you choose to do with your newly acquired African land is up to you. Use it for its resources, or release it all into one giant satellite nation. Overall, this is always an exciting event of any campaign.- Technological advancements: In 1870, everyone but the primitive nations essentially start off with the option to build infantry or cavalry, and that's about it. As for navy, you can build anything as simple as a clipper transport or frigate. As time goes on, however, and you research more, you will acquire much more advanced types of infantry and warships. I am personally a big fan of the tanks that are available in the early 20th century. More than tanks, however, I love the battleships. Nothing is more satisfying than having a battleship and spotting an enemy fleet of mere commerce raiders. It's simply too funny of a battle. Unfortunately, technology is not my favorite aspect of this game. I much prefer Hearts of Iron's system and I really wish they had implemented something similar in this game. While Victoria II has a wide variety of technology branches, I simply wish the decisions I make for research was as dynamic as it was in Hearts of Iron. I'm crossing my fingers that next time around, Victoria III (Not announced YET) will give you the option to completely focus on a specific part of the game. Considering I'm pro-navy, I would love if I could continue to improve the strengths of my battleships.In conclusion, I love this game so much. Whenever I look at all of the other grand strategy games on Steam, I contemplate, and I cry. I leap into bed and soak my pillow with tears, understanding that there will never be another day where such a worthy game will hit the stores. ...but I'm just kidding. I love Europa Universalis IV a lot too.This game is currently 75% off until September 8. A fair piece of warning, though. This review was written through the eyes of someone with both A House Divided and Heart of Darkness. While the vanilla game is $5, I highly recommend just grabbing the other two DLC to ensure that you feel you made a satisfying purchase.  ",92,8,1,10,39,0,42

												The most interesting of all the Paradox Interactive games. This game does not require you to be a war-monger. This game does not require you to micromanage silly family members. Rather, this game lets you have an extreme challenge by simply maintaining your nation and ideology through some incredible changes in technology and politics. You can also wage a lot of wars without ever expanding your own territory - instead, you simply seek to liberate countries and maintain a democratic, fascist, monarchist, or socialist world order. Even if all you want to do is build up your own little country and develop lots of heavy industry, while maintaining neutrality in the various Great Wars that start happening, that is still challenging and fun.

												Victoria II is the most interesting and addicting grand strategy game that I've ever played hands down. It covers every aspect of the era. Some of those aspects including Industrialization, New Imperialism. Nationalism and the beginning of modern day revolutionist ideas and tactics. When I play Victoria II I feel a bond with the nation I'm playing. I almost develop a temporary sense of nationalism, wanting to further my nation to sitting in the #1 great power spot that it deserves to be in. If a grand strategy game can be so in depth that it makes me feel like I'm actually in the leader's position then the devolopers made this game right. This game perfectly represents the time period and also has educational value. When I played my first run as Prussia using the Historical Project Mod (I would highly recommend this mod. It completely revamps the game to more accurately represent the time period and it also improves many of the statistics and balances the game better.) I often found myself looking into the nation's history and many key decisions the leaders made to form the German Empire. Currently as I'm writing this review I have 536 hours in Victoria II and I only plan to see that number go higher as I continue to play this amazing game.			",137,13,0,22,42,0,40

												The first nation I chose to play as was Russia, which proved to be a terrible choice for obvious reasons. Then I decided to go with a smaller but not highly vulnerable underdog nation to ease my learning curve, and went with Japan. After numerous decades and a dozen or so hours of playtime, not only had I civilized and modernized all of Japan and brought forth a new era of industrial supremacy, but I skyrocketed the nation to the rank of a Great Power. By the 1880's, after multiple successful wars with Russia, Korea, China, and several other countries, Japan nearly tripled in size and had become the 5th greatest nation in the world, right behind Russia. At first I was overcome by the sheer joy of success, as Japan was ranked third in industrial power and was one of the most prestigious nations in the world. Then as my economy began to slow down, my income was turning negative for the first time in over a decade as factories closed and unemployment jumped. I began to raise taxes, cut my military and navy, and then I began to raise doubts about my countries future. Unfortunately, my doubts were realized. As the century turned and the 1900's began, my economy neared depression-level and the national debt was adding up, growing political divisions were threatening the countries stability, and new factions were rising up demanding things like workers rights and calling for a liberal government. The tension came to a boiling point in Pyongyang, where nearly twenty thousand Korean rebels rose up in arms against Japanese rule and were completely annihilated before they could even take two steps forward. At what seemed like the worst time, I was plunged into a war between Germany and Russia, as Germany was the #1 world super power and was my closest ally. Actually, Germany was one of very few countries willing to ally with me as my infamy was a little too high from the Japanese conquests in Korea, China, and Russia. More great powers suddenly joined the war, and it became known as the Great War. My forces were diminished from the get-go, and my allies were too busy fighting their own battles. Before long I was utterly decimated by an invasion force of Russian and French forces and rage quit. I still haven't turned the tide, but nonetheless I rate this game 10/10.			",89,13,1,13,11,0,15

												 Victoria 2, yet another Grand Strategy Game produced by Paradox Interactive, however unlike Hearts of Iron taking you through the second world war, Victoria 2 takes you through the Victorian era, a period of colonization, nationalism, industrialization, and westernization. You play literally as any country from 1836, from the United States of Central America to the Free City of Kraków, and guide it through the Industrial era and the Victorian era.  Forge your destiny as you guide your nation through 100 years of industrialization, war, and colonization, vie for Great Power status and sign Alliances that at a split second, could be aimed at you, survive anarcho-liberal uprisings and anti-western partisans as you try to westernize as Japan. Along with nations that already exist, there are some that are relasable or formable; defeat the Russian Empire as Sweden and form Scandinavia, release Scotland from the United Kingdom and form your own Empire.  Play as Prussia and Form The North German Confederation, and then Germany, play as Two Sicilies and form Italy, play as France and become a giant blob, the choice is yours, for 100 years you are free to achieve your goals, and watch the world change, not even the AI choose the same path each time.    Will the Communist Rebels in France take Paris and install their own government? Will the Anarcho-Liberal anarchists take power in Russia? Will America spread burgers throughout the world? Will the Soviet Union fall to Democratic Germany, will Fascist France continue its rivalry with Communist Britain? Will Australia become a Communist Global power and vie with Democratic New Zealand? Or will the Democratic Rebels in the West stutter the Aussies' Chances? Will the Irish Rebels beat back the British units and declare independence? Will Liberia colonize all of Africa before the scramble even starts? Will Texas annex Mexico? Will the California Republic invade Hawaii? Will the CSA end the Civil war with a Stalemate? Will the CSA come begging to the USA again for Union? Will Poland into space? Will Bolivia into Coastline? Will Switzerland sit on its bum and watch the world go by? Will China industrialize and defeat the Western industry? Will Russia keep Alaska? Will Jews elect a facist party in Israel? I'm not certain, but all of this is possible in Victoria 2.  Pro's:  +Balanced combat, as well as a nice amount of units (not too many, not too little) and provide nice costumization of forces +Great powers and secondary powers make the game feel more real + Neat political system (upperhouse, elections and reforms) + Factory system + Attention to detail: Each country has its own flags for Monarchy, Republic, Fascist and Communist. And most countries have flavour events. + You can change history  Con´s: - Steep learning curve   Overall rating: 14/15 (Must own for history nerds and strategy gamers)			",209,22,3,14,32,1,25

												Any game from Paradox should be seen as an investment; initially they take time to come to grips with but once you have a handle on them, nothing quite scratches that strategy itch. You also get plenty of DLC, while many feel this is nickle and diming - which all too often it is - with Paradox it is to help support the games as they continue to provide updates and keep their games alive far longer than most other game studios. Word to the wise, Steam sales are your friend here, as often Paradox will sell older DLC for around 75% off in larger sales. Also, they fully support the modding community which adds so much value and extra enjoyment. Choose any country and forge it into an Empire that stands first among the Great Powers. I feel Paradox hadn't quite hit their stride here and there are some quirks that don't feel so smooth here. However, the game is vastly enjoyable and eminently time-consuming. If you feel a little at sea, I would recommend finding Let's Plays on YouTube to show you what you might be having difficulty with. I learned the intricacies of Victoria 2 from Shenryyr2, myself. Thanks! Choose your nation, pursue technologies, set your influences, encourage your nation through focuses, and build both armies and navies to police,  expand your Empire to become a Great Power. Take decisions that add flavour to your gameplay.8/10 - would pursue world domination again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Good geopolitical, economic, and demographic simulation and game. Warfare below the geopolitical and strategic level, however, is less realistic and also rather tedious, having to micromanage all the small mobilized units. Also politics is somewhat barebones and often behaves unrealistically. Additionally, wars between Great Powers in this game happens way too often compared to history and are not consequential enough generally, in that they generally do not result in fundamental paradigm shifts in the world order and balance of power such as in the Franco-Prussian War or the Russo-Japanese War.

												Victoria II (and its expansion packs) is one of my all-time favorite games. The depth of the game is extraordinary; you can choose to follow a nation's path through history or change it to your liking. The diplomacy, economics, and warfare in the game feel very realistic, especially as the game progresses into the modern era. The learning curve is steep but the process is quite entertaining. A House Divided and Heart of Darkness offer so many improvements to the game, such as the international crisis system and the ability to begin the campaign at the outbreak of the American Civil War. In summary, I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys grand strategy games or just have an interest in history (or changing it).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really hated this game and Europa Universalis when I first got them.  I wanted to jump in, murder all of the nonbelievers and create the world under my iron fist.  This is not that type of game.  Even though Civ and Total War pretend they've made improvements in diplomacy, they still really only come down to killing everyone else.You will not jump into this game and eradicate the lesser countries.  What you can do... is subjugate them under your nation, push your influence, and try and form the nations of Italy, Germany, etc... out of the smaller city states.  Or if your citizens live in a state owned by another nation (such as Greece and the Aegis Islands being owned by the Ottomans), you can through some sneakery diplomacy take them with no bloodshed, or even get the major world powers to do the dirty work for you if you need some early weak undeveloped nations to colonize but lack the resources to mobilize yourself.There's a definite learning curve, but luckily there's Youtube to show you what the heck you're doing.Now that I've given it a second chance and know better what to expect from it, I definitely see what everyone meant about this being the 'big boy game' that you move to when you grow up from Civ (not that I dislike Civ at all).

												After getting this game heavily discounted, I can safely say that it has some of the best value of all the titles found on Steam. You've got tons of nations to choose from, and many play quite differently. Whether you want to expand mercilessly as Prussia, further your empire as the UK, dominate your neighbours as Punjab, or fight to restore Romania, it's up to you. Know that if you want to play a minor, especially an uncivilized nation, that this game is not kind, so be prepared to fight way harder.Anyways, the game is simple to manage, but frustratingly hard to grasp. The tutorial doesn't help. AI management is bad, especially when it comes to consolidating troops, and the game isn't one for those who expect even a loose adherence to history.Beyond that, this game really is terrific, and worthy of a purchase, arguably at full price (Though the expansions seem to be a must). With all that said, there's nothing more satisfying after a century of growth then to see your country as one of the great powers, or even supplanting the UK as number one.			",23,11,0,11,3,0,15

												Victoria II is a grand strategy game from Paradox Interactive, the same company that created Europa Universalis, Crusader Kings, and Hearts of Iron. The game is easy to learn to play, but challenging to master. It features very complex inner-workings that can take a very long time to fully understand, but players willing to tackle the challnges this game brings will be entertained for hundreds of hours.In a nutshell, Victoria II gives the player command of any country on earth in the century from 1836 to 1936. It is a game based on history, but it is not an historical simulation. Expect weird things to occur, like a communist revolution in Texas, a globe-spanning Greek Empire, or a fascist Brunei launching devastating wars of conquest in every continent.The player's role in the game is to ensure their country's success or dominance. Like other Paradox games, you cannot ""win"" or ""lose"". There are no standardized goals, like ""Conquer 50 provinces"" or ""Destroy Such-And-Such"". Rather, you  do whatever you want to see your country and its population thrive (or collapse into total anarchy and civil war, if that's your thing). You can use any number of tools to see your country grow, from cajoling other states into joining your ""sphere of influence"", to forcing them in at the tip of your sword; from encouraging immigration to your lands, to conquering more populated lands; from building titanic industrial machines, to dispersing protesting strikers dragging down your titanic industrial machine. Warfare forms the core of the game, with economic and political concerns filling in the peacetime. You'll often find yourself invading other territories to secure access to an important resource your factories need, otherwise those factories will go out of business and uppity, hungry workers will insist on throwing your Absolutely-Monarchical♥♥♥♥♥out on the street to watch in the cold while they establish a Dictatorship of the Proletariat.The game is intricate and difficult to master, but the online community will help you overcome most of the impediments. There is also still something of a modding community, impressive after 4 years. The existing mods are quite fun to play, greatly enhancing aspects of the game or setting it in different eras. All in all, 9/10.			",26,3,0,11,8,0,18

												Honestly, I don't know what to write about Victoria II. I raised an island of polar bears to be a (temporary) world power, only to be the 13th power by the end. (""Spoiler tags on an old, grand strategy game? Why would that be?"") I've brought Austria up to be a domineering military power. I fought against the Union in the Civil War and lost miserably. I've done so many things, yet there's so much more that I can do. To be straightforward, I am by no means recommending this game for everyone. You have to want to play this sort of game. It's slow, but engrossing. It's difficult, but rewarding. It's boring at times, but then Russia decides it wants half of your country and suddenly you're struggling to build an army, then France decides they want the other half.			",237,66,5,30,42,4,51

												Love the game it definetly goes highly into the structures of a country and how economy and things like that work. This is definetly not a game for declaring war you will seriously be punished if you declare war 2 or 3 times the greatest powers will declare war or secondary powers will. I reccomend you get allies as fast and as much as possible it is very crucial. I also like how communists and facists can overthrow your government it is more interestings and I also like that your flag gets changed when they overthrow it. If you played EU4 than this is just 16 years after the ending it can be like a continuation and after this HOI3 which also starts in 1936 the year the game ends. Although the thing I dont like is that you cant choose the year that you want to play in. It would be more fun if it was like EU4 and HOI3 which has a list of start dates like WW1 should have been at least one of the start dates... Other than that the game is pretty much good onwards really love playing this game it isn't easy but it isn't exactly hard I think it is one of the most new player friendly games out of EU4 and HOI3 and CKII. Good game I would give it a 10/10!			",46,7,0,6,18,0,20

												I would say that this is a great game (which it is you should buy it). But the multiplayer never seems to work for me. However every other aspect of the game is brilliant, such as, how you can play as Texas (the best place EVER), and how you can have a state secede peacfully from a country and then play as the (ex. Scottland).Over All: 8.5/10So what are you waiting for?!? GO BUY IT!!!			",36,5,0,7,14,1,12

												My meager wordsmithing cannot hope to encompass this work of art. It's like Fight Club, you decide your level of involvement.

												I love this game, I have spent hours on it.In case you are wondering how much, I have played it since it was put on shelf's on one of my favorite stores.Well anyways, my game was a ""non-steam"" game, so there is no evidence to as how long as I played that version.Though I will say it's more addicting than candy-crush, every nation can be player controlled, and each one of them is unique.It's an inversive game that will keep you hooked, with battle planning, global affairs, and crisises pulling countries into World Wars. Ranging from 1836 to when the world was still recovering from the likes of Napoleon to 1936 just shy of World War 2.With over 100 years, you can set the speed for which your country takes.With Diplomacy and many other things to look after, you'll be kept concentrated on the game. Don't worry, you do not need to micro-manage, the game does that for you, but if you want full control, it's all there.Then there is colonization.America and Mexico compete for land, while Britain colonizes Canada.But you can change this.You choose the alternate course of history, and you can decide who colonizes what.The riches of Africa beckon, a Russian or even Austrian Africa is possible.You guide your country to place itself onto it's rightful place at the top.This is an excellent game, and I recommend it to people who like playing games where you must control a nation.

												After around 160 hours of straight playing, Victoria 2 has been my favourite grand strategy game, I love it more than CK2, HOI3 and EU3. It's been very enjoyable, it has a lot of hidden mechanics, while not being as confusing as HOI3, or as bare bones as CK2. The game has a massive choice of countries, most of which you will be able to succeed with. Whether you are playing Japan or Bavaria, if you're good enough you will be able to play it. The game does have a few lag spikes, but that may just be the five year old or so computer I play it on.                                                                                                      The game has some glitches which can be annoying, but not a lot of them are game breaking. One rather annoying thing is the fact that once you install the expansion, everything is a bit less crazy. I play Paradox games for alternate history,  not to see a bunch of AI gobble up helpless Asiaa Minorites.Still, after that, the game is still absolutely fantastic, and if you are a fan of Paradox Strategy games, you should already own this.

												Review:I love victoria II, after playing for over 70 hours of eu4 this doesnt feels the same to me, the way the politics work is amazing and super addicting, Its crazy how much information 'bout people is in the game, there are so much groups of people. The diplomacy is good but feels the same as eu4(whats not that shocking!) but still cool. The industry is not the greatest part but its okay, it comes a little bit simple over but what makes it more challenging is to plan to have a own operating industry(with alot of own resoucred used). Start tips:I would recommend to play as sweden you first need to fix the crisis(not that big of a problem just put the education, admin etc. down) after that if you work out the industry good you can reach the top 8 as 8th. Try to stay conservative but also get liberals so you can reform and you need conservative government to build industry by your own(whats if you ask me really important),  its buggy that you can upgrade the factory's as liberal. 8.5/10			",7,1,1,4,9,0,5

												A very fun strategy where the goal is to become a world power through colonization, diplomacy, and empire building. If you're not familiar with Paradox Interactive, this is another grand strategy game that takes some time to learn. However, a lot of things can be found out on your first playthrough by just pausing the game and doing a quick google search. There's nothing very difficult about the game, just a lot to learn and it ends up being very rewarding.It's highly recommended you buy the DLC which adds much better mechanics than the base game. There's also pretty decent modding community if that's your thing.			",96,14,11,16,25,0,18

If you only have $20 I might recommend EU4 or CK2 (other paradox titles), but this is one of the best in the grand strategy genre.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Made South Africa a wealthy, non-racist communist state 10/10In all honesty, this game is great for going abroad, or just wasting time. The basic concept? You choose a country and make it a prosperous nation, or drive it into ruin.Gameplay: You control a nation from 1836 for 100 years. In this timespan, a wide range of events can occur, such as wars, hostile and friendly takeovers by other powers. Be a satellite state or become a world power. Pretty much anything is possible in this game (Never forget the Russian Colony of Madagascar), so this game is perfect for scenario-enthusiatists like me. ",141,15,4,8,6,1,2

												Easier to get into then Vic 1. (all expansions added for both)Better experiance overall. Micromanaging is minimised, But all of the deep strategy is still there.Takes a while to get into, learn and absorb. But, it's easier to grasp then Vic 1.Overall a great game. Spent hours getting a handle on things. Then ran two types of dictatorships over the course of two full games as  Federal Republic of Central America [en.wikipedia.org]  one game was a liberal dictatorship and the best one was the presidential dictatorship. BUt easily both are viable. Including staying a democracy.Vic 1 took me a couple of years to master and much research and videos and strategy guides.Vic 2 took me a few days to master, with very little research.I think vic 2 plays better then vic as a multiplayer as there is much less to individually focus on, thus less pausing and stuff.Which makes for a better faster game.

												Victoria II, a game which introduced me to Grand Strategy. (This review is abit long hue hue)The game starts off at the peak of the industrial revolution. The world is pushed into this great leap that no one has ever seen before. Smoke rises from the newly built factories. Railroad tracks can be seen in almost every part of the globe, connecting city after city. Warfare has now changed into a more deadlier way. The old wooden ships are now replaced by steam-propelled warships protected by iron or steel plates. It is the early 19th century, and thus a new age is born.Victoria II is a game for those who love grand strategy games and (most importantly) history. This game will blow your mind because of the depth of gameplay that the dev's put into this game. Diplomacy, History, Politics, Warfare, Technology, and even Economy can be seen in this game. Every player has his/her own style of play. You can play as Great Britain and just colonize every part of the world that is not colonized yet. You can be Prussia and unite all the german people into one banner. You can be Denmark and try to make Scandinavia for yourself. You can be any nation you want in this game's time period. This is one of those games that makes you think hard on what to do next. Maybe rise the taxes? Make war to all your neighbors? Take on the Great Powers of the World and try to make them step down from their outstanding greatness? Forge an empire which will humiliate the United Kingdom? Make the richest nation of the world? Isolate yourself from wars or be neutral, like Switzerland? Maintain a monarchy that controls the whole country? It is up to you on how you play your country in Victoria II.Im giving this game a 9/10. Game is amazing but there are times that the AI is just a ♥♥♥♥♥.Grab this game now or in a steam sale. I suggest you get the complete version of the game because its complete and has the awesome uniforms that germany used before and during the years of World War One (which I personally love).

												Single best game I have on Steam. For anyone who enjoys PDS games (like EU, or CK) Victoria 2 is a must have. Some PDS games focus on warfare, like HoI, and because of that many of the non-warfare options can feel like tacked on complications to make war harder. Victoria 2 takes the opposite approach. You can play an entire game without fighting a single battle and yet still have a full and rich experience. If you are looking for something more than a war game, you've found it.

												I've gone to war over influence on overseas cotton-producing states, so I could have first dibs on the raw materials needed to sustain my growing clothing industry.Pretty good.It's a bit slower to get going than the other Paradox games, and it's not as polished as the most recent ones (Crusader Kings II and Europa Universalis IV), but it does offer some great atmosphere and a pretty interesting industry system.

												Imagine a beautiful piece of music that's recorded on a potato, or a brilliant screenplay with a cast of entirely autistic people. That's what VicII is like -  an incredibly original, balanced and fun game that's just so, so deeply flawed. Don't get me wrong, it's my favourite paradox game (or possibly my favourite game altogether) - there are no other games with this level of depth that just work so well. When everything goes right in VicII - you've made it to the 20th century, you're a great power and you're having an arms race preparing for a great war - it feels completely perfect.I can't think of another game where the actual *gameplay* changes naturally over time. When machine guns, trench warfare and indirect fire artillery have been developed by about 1890, there's no popup saying ""Wars are fought statically now!"". It just happens to be that to win a war after that point, you have to stop massing your troops into large armies and start lining them along your borders. You're not *forced* to do this, it's just that the bonuses to defence are so high that you have no choice.Similarly, the economy and politics goes from being a trivial backwater of your country to completely dominating everything you do. By the end of the game factories are absolutely *crucial* and you'll be bending over backwards to get everything working the way you want. Politics goes from completely conservative dominated to a nightmare - by the end of the game, fascist, jacobin and communist revolutions are bulk standard. And if you have a communist revolution, for example, the way you play the game has to adapt dramatically (micro-managing your economy can be a damn nightmare). In the 100 years Vic II covers, you inevitably go from being in control of your economy and your population to being terrified of them - effective strategy becomes absolutely essential to achieving your goals.So in terms of general strategic depth, this game is absolutely unrivaled. The flaws however, are myriad. Vic II was made before Paradox miraculously got good at programming games with CKII; despite being released in 2009 the graphics feel they came from about 10 years earlier. The game is *slow*. If your economy hasn't kicked off and you're not fighting a war, this is a waiting game. The first 30 years of a non-western country are even worse - the westernizing process is basically just several hours of sitting around doing absolutely nothing. The game *does* pick up towards its last half - but the first half can be really, damningly boring.There are also some major gameplay flaws that really, really break the immersion, e.g the definition of a 'great power' as the top 8 scoring countries. While this is fine in itself, 'score' takes into account prestige as much as it does military strength. It's pretty normal to see Russia lose its great power status due to a lack of prestige and be overtaken by Belgium, Bavaria or Switzerland. And then, come 1890 the first 'Great War' starts with Germany, France, Italy, and the USA on one side and Belgium and Switzerland on the other - which is an *entirely* game ruining experience. A great war is *supposed* to be a cataclysmic war that goes on for years and years and reshapes the world in the process - when it ends after a month when Germany simply walks its troops into Belgium, it feels really, really dumb.I have some other pet peeves - for example, the way the USA is hard-coded to get way more immigrants than everybody else - even other large colonial nations like Mexico or Brazil. This means that the Americas are incredibly predictable, every game. Not once have I seen something happen other than the USA becoming a top great power with the entire continent in its sphere. It's just really really dull. There's no way to play as Mexico or Brazil and try to rival the USA for dominance of the area. With that one move Paradox cut off half the world from ever being interesting.So yeah. It's a brilliant game that will drive you up the walls out of frustration. It's definitely worth playing, but holy♥♥♥♥♥♥I hope Vic III is better than this.			",29,4,0,4,5,0,15

												A Grand Strategy Title by Paradox Interactive which deserves the adjective 'Grand' clearly. The objective of the game is to pick a nation and lead it to greatness. To achieve this goal you have to build up your army & industry, keep up in research, start reforms and polish your prestige. There are multiple form of governments and nearly all can be established in any country if the right conditions are met. Once you are a great power, it's also your objective to keep up that status, since there are other nations rising. But beware, the game will flood you with data. The developers tried to make the data as useful and accessible as possible, which worked (customizable pie charts to see what really is of your interest) but failed on the other side (you have to get used to it and it still is 'bulky')If you like complex strategy games and the Victorian period, you will defenitely like this one. All the features of the game are linked together and make Victoria as interesting as it is.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the greatest grand strategy games by Paradox ever, almost every game is different and provides hundreds of hours of fun. The game has great DLC and covers everything from diplomacy to the colonisation of Africa, and the game also balances the more powerful nations so you can play as a small nation and not get destroyed. I highly recommend this game as it is fun and provides a different aspect to grand strategy games like EU3 or Crusader Kings II.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

When the ""best"" advice to make a AAA published game work is to use third party software that I've never heard of before, then that's not an option either.

Choose any country you like no matter how minor and manage the politics, military, and the reforms of your country. There are some five government types you can choose from that stay true to the 1836-1935 Era.I do recommend you get the expansions as well as the pop demand mod they make the game way better and harder.This game is amazing you should pick it up now if you like Grand strategies.

												An extraordinary game. I questioned buying it when I first viewed it but I'm happy I did. Here are the things I have done:-Forced China to repay debts when playing as Canada-Conquered most of Europe while playing as Greater Germany -Colonized most of the Pacific as Spain and battled my way through conquering Africa-Played as Brazil, made it to a great power and conquered a lot of South America, rivaling the US as the dominant power on the Americas-Created an economic empire playing as the NetherlandsThese are just a few I have done, and it's been a great time. I recommend buying all the DLC's except the ones priced low, as they don't add much content. I have the two major DLC's and it added a lot of worthy content. Paradox Interactive makes great games and this is another trophy in the case.The only con is the economic system takes a lot of time to develop and maintain. TL;DR: This game was great and I am happy I bought it, definitely worth it!			",68,5,3,6,8,1,15

												Victoria 2 hands down is one of Paradox's best if not the best Grand Strategy game on the market. Unlike CK2 and EUIV whose interface seems scary at first are relativly simple to gain a hold of, Victoria 2 on the other hand is the inverse of this. With a simple interface that leads into a depth of strategy even after 200 hours you will continualy find new stratagies and outcomes after each game. Some examples of how unpredictable and hilarious the game can get include.1. Crushing Austria so hard in a war that for the next 20 years it changes government every year.2. Switzerland picks on said Austria.3. Having 200 Portuguese troops hold out  against 200,000 French troops in the Pyrenees.4. The United States of Amerafrica6. Jan Mayern, enough said.

												Vic2 is historically on point and packed with replay value.Rewrite modern history by uniting Scandinavia under one banner or defending the independence of the Confederate States of America from northern agression. Dominate oceania and southeast Asia as Austrialia, create a pan-Arabic Caliphate, or even expand Imperial Japan all the way to Africa.Be prepared to memorize lots of console commands in order to compensate for bugginess, and consider the variety of mod options available, but be assured that it is well worth the trouble.

												I enjoyed this game very is a very interseting era to play in. However what sold the game for me was the New World Order mod which adds the Cold War and the 21st Century to the game. I enjoyed trying to hold the BRitish Empire together in the wake of WW2 and trying to unite the European Union as the Netherlands. I strongly recommend this game and i am looking forward to a Victoria 3 in the future.			",3,1,0,7,5,0,5

												This game is just simply great. You really feel immursed into the game world with world newspapers (If you have Heart of Darkness DLC), making political decisions, and regulating trade businesses and transportation of your country. It takes a while to get the hang of but when you do be prepared for great gameplay and possiably WORLD DOMINATION!!! It also raises challenging questions like ""Why do I have Jacobin Rebels when I am the united states?"" or "" Why do i have Polish liberation movements when i don't own anything polish?"" The only thing that can make this game better is playing with friends.This game gets a solid 10/10 from me. ",46,5,0,14,8,0,15

												When I found myself as liberal Russia fighting the French fascists and communist USA in the kingdom of Mexico, I knew this was a great game.Victoria 2 might be the only strategy game I would ever recommend to someone who doesn't like armies, navies or wars. While it can and does exist as a war game, the game also painstakingly details the political life of a country, and ties it to scientific discovery, economic growth and turmoil, and ethnic strife. The game begins in 1836--when the world is rural, religious, and disconnected. It ends in 1936, when democracy, communism and fascism are using radio and film to fight for the hearts and minds of millions of people.Nation-states like Germany and Italy (as well as some that never existed like Scandanavia) can be formed as much by shrewd political maneuvering as by military might. Some countries like Russia, Brazil and China are very difficult to play simply because of their own internal problems, and a new player might spend much of the game fighting reactionaries and revolutionaries that retard economic and scientific growth. Other countries like France, Japan and the USA feel almost too easy, and you wonder why the USA didn't do even better than it did in real life. It also allows you to ponder vastly different (yet ostensibly possible) histories like:-A democratic Russia-China as a great power by 1920 with the world's largest economy-A communist United States-Austria forming Greater Germany-Panjab uniting India in the late 1800s under Sikhism-The Ottomans surviving as a federated multicutural state...et cetera. I even revamped Liberia's infrastructure and education early on and went on to conquer half of Africa by 1910.The biggest problem with Victoria 2 is that with so many variables that interact with one another, the game still isn't completely fine tuned. This small amount of error becomes noticeable when you have 90% of your population joining in an Anarcho-Liberal (i.e. Libertarian) uprising. The mods available on Paradox's forums fix a lot of these issues as well as revamping and adding gameplay. If you like simulators like SimCity, strategy games like Civilization, or any developments between 1836 and 1936, buy this game.			",44,4,3,1,5,0,4

												An extraordinary game. I questioned buying it when I first viewed it but I'm happy I did. Here are the things I have done:-Forced China to repay debts when playing as Canada-Conquered most of Europe while playing as Greater Germany -Colonized most of the Pacific as Spain and battled my way through conquering Africa-Played as Brazil, made it to a great power and conquered a lot of South America, rivaling the US as the dominant power on the Americas-Created an economic empire playing as the NetherlandsThese are just a few I have done, and it's been a great time. I recommend buying all the DLC's except the ones priced low, as they don't add much content. I have the two major DLC's and it added a lot of worthy content. Paradox Interactive makes great games and this is another trophy in the case.The only con is the economic system takes a lot of time to develop and maintain. TL;DR: This game was great and I am happy I bought it, definitely worth it!			",68,5,3,6,8,1,15

												A very thorough and facisnating historical victorian age simulator. Very difficult to play legit (but well worth getting your true ending). The games multiplayer can be a tad buggy but is otherwise very enjoyable. The AI is quite refined and conflicts have been revamped in the expansion (heart of darkness). A popular mod is ""PoPs of Darkness"" which makes some adjustments to the economy for a little more open ended gameplay. Definitely one of my favorites from Paradox.Things I have done in this game (so far):-Built a large Navy as Persia and controlled the Gulf oil regions for their continued existence.-Reunited India after first playing as Britain to release all my vassal Indian colonies.-Using said country to invade my neighbor and eventually flood the world market with my cheap goods.-Realize you have limits and accidentally go to war with the whole world.

												Here's the Evil Scheme I came up with this afternoon... Presently I (the Glorious Tsar) have been dragged by my Prussian ally into a war with France. Considering my ambition to ensure the North German Federation never forms, I was going to abandon the Prussians, but then I stumbeled upon a most EEEvil fact...France is allied with Portugal. Thusly... I can....1. Build up the warscore to nab Mozambique, a wonderful beachead in Africa, while letting the Prussians take most of the casualties in Europe. Sadly I can't let them take ALL the casualties in Europe, because they have a tendency to sit 60,000 men in a single province and let them attrition themselves to death, and the French army is pretty damn big. Regardless, I have plenty of peasants. 2. Make a seperate peace with France that gives me Mozambique. Whilst killing a French soldier or two and fighting to slay the Portugese, manufacture a Caucus Belli on Prussia. 3. Declare war on Prussia, who will by now be decimated from the long war with France. Use Austrian support (Austria's my ally but not at all friends with Prussia) to crush the Prussians, take over some nice East German provinces, and strangle any hopes of a united germany in the cradle. Oh, and Note to Self: remember to sphere Manchuria to get the Pekeing treaty land before invading China and nabbing that goldmine I missed in the last war... Get this game. You might find yourself cackling at odd, embarrassing times... but get this game. NOW. Cheers, Tsar Strategos the Magnificent			",28,0,0,9,4,0,12

Also, although the combat visuals might be lacking, you are still kept on the edge of your seat as one of your beloved armies fight off hordes of evil commies and uncivilized barbarians. The political map is beautiful to behold and with the expansions, the crises and colonization aspects of the game really add some good action, whether its trying to bet on who will win a crisis by throwing in your lot with one side or racing to colonize a patch of desert in the middle of the Sahara. 10/10 epic game			",26,2,0,3,14,0,21

												This is like the Advanced course for Paradox spergs like myself (Victoria 1 is the KILL YOURSELF NOW course fyi, fun but impossible to understand). It's the last game Paradox made before they changed their development process for CK2 so it suffers a but from the 'Old Paradox' ways of having the sequential expansions that act as patches. With Heart of Darkness, it's very good, though its one expansion away from really becoming as excellent as EU3 was and CK2 is and EU4 will be. It's based in a fascinating period of history and it's my favorite setting for a Paradox game because you can get the sense of the world shifting massively throughout the time period. From post-Napleonic squabbles over random crap, to the heyday of colonizing Africa and building railroads across the West, to the chaos and horror of the Great War and fascist/communist takeovers, Victoria covers it all. I really wish that we get a Victoria 3 of the same quality as CK2 and EU4 and that it comes with a EU4-V3 converter.			",377,81,14,58,56,3,78

												At first you see this game, you'll think it's boring, but the real thing is, it isn't boring, this game shows you and also teach you how to run a country from all sides, internal and external. The pathyour contry goes will be determined by your skills, economy, military, and diplomacy. This game provides detail information about problems, and decisions that you make. I recommend you to buy this game if you love strategy games, because this is the best one besides Crusader Kings IIHope you find my review helpful,Peace:)			",70,12,2,9,46,0,24

												One of the greatest grand strategy games by Paradox ever, almost every game is different and provides hundreds of hours of fun. The game has great DLC and covers everything from diplomacy to the colonisation of Africa, and the game also balances the more powerful nations so you can play as a small nation and not get destroyed. I highly recommend this game as it is fun and provides a different aspect to grand strategy games like EU3 or Crusader Kings II.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really dig Paradox games.  I've got 5-6,000 hours logged across their different releases.  This game had the POTENTIAL to be the best of the lot released in the last few years.  Unfortunately sales apparently weren't so good and they walked away from it.  Which SUCKS.  It's still a very good game, but you need to either DL a mod or cheat judiciously using console commands(good luck not OPing there).  Otherwise the balance of the game feels kind of wonky and you can find yourself sitting at the keys watching the screen as you do nada.

												Is it new? Is it flashy? Is it good-looking? No, absolutely not. Despite that, it's my favourite grand strategy game of all time. I have no idea how I've put so many hours into Victoria II, but I have, and I'll keep on putting in more until a sequel comes out - which it had better, Paradox!Deceptively replayable, with an incredibly deep demographics and economics system that will take poring over a few textbooks to completely understand. Despite no country actually having truly unique gameplay elements besides some events and decisions, all of them stand out on their own due to the makeup of their populatiosn, the resources within their borders, and the geopolitical situations in which they find themselves.To give you an idea, I've put over 600 hours into this game and I still haven't gotten around to playing as Prussia even once.

												Paradox sucked me in with their dynastic simulator, Crusader Kings II.  My addiction deepened with the conquest-driven Europa Universalis IV.  Then I found Victoria II.  These three games each cover distinct time periods and sport their own unique gameplay.  Vicky 2 is my favorite because of the staggering amount of nation control available to play around with.  Other reviews do a better job of detailing it, but I have found the system addictively complex but never overly-complicated.  The ability to automate trade is helping me get my feet wet without overwhelming me, and I can't wait to start messing around in there either.  Already, when I go back to play the other two games, I find myself longing for the kind of internal management capabilities only found herein.  Hooked!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is an excellent grand strategy game, with an ideal balance between complexity and accessibility. Of all the Paradox grand strategy games, Victoria II makes me feel most like a real, historical leader, with more methods of expansion that just military conquest, as other titles such as EU III and EU IV can feel like. The expansions are also great, with Heart of Darkness' Great War mechanic really making wars between Great Powers feel meaty and fulfilling. The game can sometimes be a little ridiculous, (such as Russia demanding Scotland as part of a peace deal with the United Kingdom, and African colonial empires often looking like random, intertwined shapes than chosive colonial territories) but the expansions again fix most of these issues with nations taking huge infamy hits for taking regions they have no claim on, and also requiring a valid reason for delaring war in the first place. On the whole, this game feels very rewarding. Your decisons feel as though they have real concequences, and no two playthroughs are the same. The learning curve is not too steep (compared to say Hearts of Iron III), meaning a few trial games will allow you to know most of the games mechanics. In conclusion, an excellent game, still being supported by the developers, that I always come back to, despite numerous other Paradox strategy games being released since its initial relsease.

												Victoria II is, by all standards of modern gaming, a classic. It combines the ease of use and adaptability of past Paradox games with a dynamic, mildly fast paced action on the strategic map. Tons of decisions and political choices to make, an enthrilling political system, cool classic scenarios for the time period 1836-1936 with a very fluid flow of events. I would reccomend this title to newcomers and veterans alike, as it is one rare gem of a game these days, one that keeps you interested, engaged and involved in the action both from an industrial / economical standpoint and a more political / military one. The one rule for newcomers: DONT PANIC. It will be an experience that, in time, will most certainly grant anybody a fun time in one of History's most interesting boiling points. Play one of the major factions in the world or strive for freedom as one of the smaler ones, while reforming, adapting to the shift into the modern era, or try to destroy the seemingly untouchable spread of nationalism to remain on your Imperial seat.What more do you need?

												It's almost as if they designed the game specifically assuming that you have the micromanagement skills of the AI. Playing as a communist or socialist country is pretty much impossible if you want to have a high industrial score, which kind of defeats the point. Migrating soldier pops mean you have to constantly micromanage armies and replace troops when they suddenly decide to move to another state (which somehow means they can no longer replinish?). There's no army template, like in EU IV, even though it could easily be managed. Naval combat is a drag, and navies take forever to build up despite little to no actual benefit of having them. The UI is tedious, the map modes lacking. I got good at the game before I could even understand how everything worked, easily westernizing as Nejd, taking over all of the Middle East, westernizing, and pretty easily getting into 6th place before my armies got too big to micromanage and Russia tore me to pieces, despite having a far inferior army. The world market is broke to♥♥♥♥♥♥ Liquor demand is through the roof, yet there's always some being thrown out while my guards wait forever to get some, making the recruitment of them impossible (there is a similar problem with demand not being high enough for advanced goods later on, like barrels for tanks). Overall, this is a good game, but it desperately needs to fix the micromanagement.			",38,0,0,10,13,0,16

												>Recommended<Out of almost 600 hours of gameplay put into this game, it is clearly because I enjoy playing it. Victoria II is a strategy game which takes place in the aftermath of the Napoloenic Wars. It it now that the white man shows his power and intentions of ruling the world with an iron fist. You can control any nation on the planet in the 19th century. The bulding of an empire starts in Europe, play as Prussia (Germany), the birth of a new superpower, which is to flip the balance of power in Europe. The vanilla game of Vicotoria II is a fantastic adventure, form empires, control dominions and colonize the world (The scramble for Africa). I recommend giving this game a shot, it will be well worth the money, especially thanks to the fantastic mods that have been created for this game, which is to be found on various websites.

												In Victoria 2, you play as a nation for 100 years, starting in 1836. The game primarily revolves around the ""pops"" (a simulation of your population), who can have various jobs, purchase goods, and migrate around the world. As you play the game, you'll be industrializing your country by researching techs, building factories, and conquering other (usually less advanced) areas of the world in order to procure goods for your factories. You also have to deal with the various political ideologies which will cause your subjects to demand various government reforms, or even to openly revolt in order to attempt to enforce whatever ideology they follow (democratic reforms, communism, etc.).Pros: -fun to see an alternate history play out-pop system is well done and adds a human character to the game-interesting events, but not so many big random ones as in other games, so overall there is less luck at play-mod support. there are some excellent mods available which flesh out the game even more.Cons:-some parts of the economy simulator are kind of strange. it works ok, but feels a little unrealistic at times.-combat involves dice rolls, which imo is not the greatest thing. That being said they don't have an overwhelming effect so it isn't too luck based-doesn't have very good UI, which can be confusing.-AI can be somewhat stupid in certain situations.Overall I would recomend this game to anyone who likes longer and slower strategy games. Some important things to note for anyone interested in playing this are:1. Like all paradox games, there is no real set objective, and you are expected to set your own goals. There is a ranking system which makes it more possible to feel like you ""won"" by getting to the #1 spot, but it's not like say Civilization with victory conditions. If you prefer a more focused objective, this may not be the game for you.2. Be sure to purchase all the expansions. Unlike some later releases like Crusader Kings, where each new DLC is accompanied by a free patch, many of the expansions for this contain fixes to balance and such. You can still have fun without them of course, but the game may be a little strange.3. The interface is a bit complicated and can feel a bit overwhelming initially. Combined with the fact that there is no ""winning"", you may begin to feel like you are just sitting there doing nothing when you first play. My advice is to quickly go through the menus to get an idea of your options, and after that, don't worry about it too much and just start playing. You will likely make some stupid mistakes but overall you should be fine as long as you are playing a decently powerful country. Also, try to set smaller objectives as you go along rather than setting some huge goal at the start - this will keep things less stressful for your first game.			",49,7,0,8,7,0,20

												In Victoria 2, you play as a nation for 100 years, starting in 1836. The game primarily revolves around the ""pops"" (a simulation of your population), who can have various jobs, purchase goods, and migrate around the world. As you play the game, you'll be industrializing your country by researching techs, building factories, and conquering other (usually less advanced) areas of the world in order to procure goods for your factories. You also have to deal with the various political ideologies which will cause your subjects to demand various government reforms, or even to openly revolt in order to attempt to enforce whatever ideology they follow (democratic reforms, communism, etc.).Pros: -fun to see an alternate history play out-pop system is well done and adds a human character to the game-interesting events, but not so many big random ones as in other games, so overall there is less luck at play-mod support. there are some excellent mods available which flesh out the game even more.Cons:-some parts of the economy simulator are kind of strange. it works ok, but feels a little unrealistic at times.-combat involves dice rolls, which imo is not the greatest thing. That being said they don't have an overwhelming effect so it isn't too luck based-doesn't have very good UI, which can be confusing.-AI can be somewhat stupid in certain situations.Overall I would recomend this game to anyone who likes longer and slower strategy games. Some important things to note for anyone interested in playing this are:1. Like all paradox games, there is no real set objective, and you are expected to set your own goals. There is a ranking system which makes it more possible to feel like you ""won"" by getting to the #1 spot, but it's not like say Civilization with victory conditions. If you prefer a more focused objective, this may not be the game for you.2. Be sure to purchase all the expansions. Unlike some later releases like Crusader Kings, where each new DLC is accompanied by a free patch, many of the expansions for this contain fixes to balance and such. You can still have fun without them of course, but the game may be a little strange.3. The interface is a bit complicated and can feel a bit overwhelming initially. Combined with the fact that there is no ""winning"", you may begin to feel like you are just sitting there doing nothing when you first play. My advice is to quickly go through the menus to get an idea of your options, and after that, don't worry about it too much and just start playing. You will likely make some stupid mistakes but overall you should be fine as long as you are playing a decently powerful country. Also, try to set smaller objectives as you go along rather than setting some huge goal at the start - this will keep things less stressful for your first game.			",49,7,0,8,7,0,20

												Victoria II is one of the lesser dreadnaughts of the Paradox Interactive fleet of grand strategy games. It builds on the concepts of Europa Universalis, allowing you to take control of a nation in 1836 and see if you can't create a place in the sun for your nation before the games end date, 1936. Now, Victoria 2 has its issues. It's immensely complex to master, but easy enough to play. You have access to more charts, sliders, and government oriented features than any other Paradox games, and rivals Hearts of Iron on that note. But there's so much more to the game than that.You have to manage your political stability; ensure all ideologies are pleased. Or you can oppress your opposition, and create a one-party state if you wish. The game features several political ideologies, each with their own style and restrictions. Each nation has its own distinct parties, all of whom have different goals and policies tailored to that nation.You also have access to large amounts of information in regards to your nation's population. You can see how many capitalists, aristocrats, soldiers(enlisted and un-enlisted), farmers, etc. you have living in your nation.A House Divided adds a new starting point in 1861, and lets you justify wars by manufacturing a reason. It also adds several new features that help non-western nations be more entertaining.Heart of Darkness focuses on warfare and the geopolitical game, adding Crisis that can escalate into world wars if not resolved, and newspapers that give you a summary of important world events.All in all? An excellent game, if you enjoy Europa Universalis, or Hearts of Iron, you're bound to find a few hours of enjoyment in Victoria 2** That's an understatement.			",675,164,26,95,78,7,122

												This is how it will go down:You'll buy this game.You'll play as a Great Power, and try to conquer the world.You'll be terrified at the game's complexity.You'll cry.You'll try to understand how to use it for two weeks or so.You'll finally understand.You'll never see your family again.Victoria II gives you control over a nation during, well, Victorian times. If it existed in the early 19th Century, its playable. You'll control it up until just pre-WWII 20th Century (Gotta buy Hearts of Iron to play WWII, but it just won't have the same magic anyways...). What do you want to do? Stop the USA from ever getting its west coast as Mexico? You got it. Wanna play as the CSA by winning the American Civil War? Well, you better be a good commander, but you got it! Wanna ♥♥♥♥ing turn an independent Texas into a global superpower? You got it! You can also form nations. Prussia may get so much influence over its neighbors it becomes Germany. South America may unite under one flag. You can even play as an eskimo island with, like 3 people there and become a global superpower. WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? Oh, and kick some♥♥♥♥♥in WWI (however it happens to start in your game, and whoever the sides are) for me. Thank you.			",121,14,5,16,33,0,27

												as a whole this is a complicated game(as expected),the economy is a total enigma and even though i try to build factorys that use my raw materials and i upgrade them only if there is demand i still end up having to close some of them down due to price drops leading to negative profit. managing to keep a positive budget without taxing above 50% can only be done if you choose the right tech order while also not overextending with the standing army expansion. what i like the most about the game is the political evolution.you might end up having almost every party type in a single game, you can also influence this but for me its more fun experimenting with different types of goverment. the battle system is similar to EU, with dice rolling , but no fire/melee phases. after installing the Historical Project Mode this might be the most fun paradox strategy game i have ever played(CK,HOI,EU).i opted to have crisis locked until 1870 so the first half of the game is more linear(scripted).  then all hell breaks loose, one war can end in white peace while another can break empires(forceing them to give away all the provinces where they dont have the primary core). rebel also seem to have more success leading to interesting countries like communist italy or fascist russia. it is still hard to overthrow the great powers but there seems to be more territorial exchanges then in the vanilla version			",41,6,2,7,7,0,18

												Best Grand Strategy Game that i ever got my hands on!Are you looking to guide a nation through one of the most exciting periods in history? The industrial revolution brought about major changes in human society, and you have a chance of influencing the welfare of your people.This game is not only about war, diplomacy and economy! It is mostly about population, or POPs as they are called in the game. You have to balance education, military, resources, production, supply and demand, technological advances, culture and politics, in order to succeed. The possibilities are almost endless...you can try to become a Great Power with a small nation, you can try to conquer the world, you can try to turn the world fascist, communist or liberal, you can ruin a rival nation's economy, deplete it's population, conquer it, etc....All that and more, but still I couldn't help Poland get into space. Because of that, game gets a 9/10 instead of a pure 10. Fully recommend it tho!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's almost as if they designed the game specifically assuming that you have the micromanagement skills of the AI. Playing as a communist or socialist country is pretty much impossible if you want to have a high industrial score, which kind of defeats the point. Migrating soldier pops mean you have to constantly micromanage armies and replace troops when they suddenly decide to move to another state (which somehow means they can no longer replinish?). There's no army template, like in EU IV, even though it could easily be managed. Naval combat is a drag, and navies take forever to build up despite little to no actual benefit of having them. The UI is tedious, the map modes lacking. I got good at the game before I could even understand how everything worked, easily westernizing as Nejd, taking over all of the Middle East, westernizing, and pretty easily getting into 6th place before my armies got too big to micromanage and Russia tore me to pieces, despite having a far inferior army. The world market is broke to♥♥♥♥♥♥ Liquor demand is through the roof, yet there's always some being thrown out while my guards wait forever to get some, making the recruitment of them impossible (there is a similar problem with demand not being high enough for advanced goods later on, like barrels for tanks). Overall, this is a good game, but it desperately needs to fix the micromanagement.			",38,0,0,10,13,0,16

												>Recommended<Out of almost 600 hours of gameplay put into this game, it is clearly because I enjoy playing it. Victoria II is a strategy game which takes place in the aftermath of the Napoloenic Wars. It it now that the white man shows his power and intentions of ruling the world with an iron fist. You can control any nation on the planet in the 19th century. The bulding of an empire starts in Europe, play as Prussia (Germany), the birth of a new superpower, which is to flip the balance of power in Europe. The vanilla game of Vicotoria II is a fantastic adventure, form empires, control dominions and colonize the world (The scramble for Africa). I recommend giving this game a shot, it will be well worth the money, especially thanks to the fantastic mods that have been created for this game, which is to be found on various websites.

I rate this game 8/10 because of the AI. The way the Diplomacy is.. is like the hardest ever, you can't really become allies with nations unless you Sphere them, or influence them. Because the AI apparently has to be so Strict, otherwise, this game is one of the best strategy games i've ever played. I definitely recommend you to buy it! I don't regret a Single penny! Enjoy.

												One of the best Grand Strategy Games ever. The vanilla game is poor, very buggy and crashes often. With the dlcs and latest updates it is stable and an absolutely incredible game. For a lot of players this is too complicated, which I don't understand. Maybe for Civ players and below. With mods it goes from being an incredible game to being the best grand strategy game I have ever played. There is so much replayabilty, obviously because of the huge amount of nations and less obviously because of the huge amount of choices you have in the game. 10/10, recommend it to anyone who likes GSG games.

												Here's the Evil Scheme I came up with this afternoon... Presently I (the Glorious Tsar) have been dragged by my Prussian ally into a war with France. Considering my ambition to ensure the North German Federation never forms, I was going to abandon the Prussians, but then I stumbeled upon a most EEEvil fact...France is allied with Portugal. Thusly... I can....1. Build up the warscore to nab Mozambique, a wonderful beachead in Africa, while letting the Prussians take most of the casualties in Europe. Sadly I can't let them take ALL the casualties in Europe, because they have a tendency to sit 60,000 men in a single province and let them attrition themselves to death, and the French army is pretty damn big. Regardless, I have plenty of peasants. 2. Make a seperate peace with France that gives me Mozambique. Whilst killing a French soldier or two and fighting to slay the Portugese, manufacture a Caucus Belli on Prussia. 3. Declare war on Prussia, who will by now be decimated from the long war with France. Use Austrian support (Austria's my ally but not at all friends with Prussia) to crush the Prussians, take over some nice East German provinces, and strangle any hopes of a united germany in the cradle. Oh, and Note to Self: remember to sphere Manchuria to get the Pekeing treaty land before invading China and nabbing that goldmine I missed in the last war... Get this game. You might find yourself cackling at odd, embarrassing times... but get this game. NOW. Cheers, Tsar Strategos the Magnificent			",28,0,0,9,4,0,12

												I previously wrote that this game would not load. I found the solution.If you have the two major DLCs (or just one, at that), you need to download them one by one. I hadn't even downloaded the extra content for the game itself. Step 1 - Start up the game without the two major DLCs. There should be a download.Step 2 - Add one of the DLCs. Let it download.Step 3 - Remove that DLC, add the other, let it download.Step 4 - Add back both DLCs. Now you can play the game!Good game, extremely complicated. 7/10			",70,14,4,7,36,1,20

												Good God! Control the British Empire and conquer the world in this brilliant  grand strategy game! Of course you can also control many other countries, including the French ( but why?) and other such meaningless tiny countries. Rule Brittania! The choices you make feel meaningful, and the amount of control you have over running your chosen country is up to you, and can be very deep. That is one of the downsides as to start with you have no clue what to do and it's quite a steep learning curve in all aspects. Another downside is its many DLCS, which are mostly pointless,but if you can get them really cheap on sale, why not? Overall it is a great strategy game and offers unparalleled in-depth 19th century Empire building greatness! Enjoy and have another cup of tea!			",14,1,0,4,4,0,11

												A magnificent game, accompanied by inspiring music and the feeling of dominating an entire continent as your backwater country develops into a greater form of itself. Singleplayer is marvellous and ignoring some problems with the budget not showing the correct calculations, it works without a flaw! It mainly consists of you, the ruler of this country, attempting to 1. survive as a country; 2. strive to achieve everything necessary for the prosperity of your country; 3. resist the liberal and socialist threats to your absolute monarchy (unless you make the very poor choice of a democracy as your country). This ""campaign"" is very interesting in itself and completely sufficient for hours of entertainment and excitement. The multiplayer does however present a problem. Only LAN multiplayer is simple, trying to play with other friends requires one of those rather dubious multiplayer port-forwarding programmes, ones I do not have positive experience with (although others will argue that they are perfect). The games themselves work very smoothly, if playing with friends it is also more pleasurable to negotiate when to pause the game. A major setback however, is the cost of the game, but I believe it is worth the expense (with the ""Heart of Darkness"" DLC). The game, if one looks beyond its initial complexity and unexiting appearance, is thoroughly enjoyable, very engaging and a good source of some general knowledge. It is also very entertaining how small, regional conflicts can grow. An example I can give from personal experience is the ""War of the Bavarian Conquest of East Switzerland"". I, as Bavaria, desired to grow my territories and thus declared war on Switzerland. My Austrian ally joined me in my war. My army was intially destroyed by Switzerland (by some miracle) and Austria heavily intervened, destroying the entire Swiss army. France did not fail to notice this situation, and declared war on my alliance. Switzerland promptly surrendered and East Switzerland was now Bavarian. The Bavarian empire had begun. I had no further interest in the war and negotiated peace with France. My war was now being led by Austria against France, the combat of whom led to a mutural destruction of their respective armies.Utterly, utterly magnifivent game, it deserves recognition and the cost!

												OK, I understand♥♥♥♥♥♥now.It's a pretty great game. It basically does anything you could imagine a strategic country simulator doing, and if it doesn't, everyone and their brother has made a mod to fix it. The game starts in 1836 (though you can start in 1861 with the House Divided scenario pack), and you are given the option to play as any nation which existed at that time. Given enough patience and strategic planning, you can form other nations. If you play as one of the divided Italian states (Two Sicilies, Papal States, etc.), once you develop, annex or sphere your neighbors, you can unite into a single Italy (or just wait for an Italian Nationalist rebellion if you're lazy af).If you play as Greece, you can snag a few chunks of the Ottoman Empire and restore the Byzantine Empire. If you play as Prussia you can form the North German Federation, German Empire, etc. etc. etc., so variety is definitely a strong suit. People playing as Democratic Republics such as the US might have hard times keeping the economy running as you can only make tariffs so high in those governments (though this problem didn't last long for me because Reactionaries took over and made the U.S. a Presidential Dictatorship in which elections were outlawed and you could tariff to your Authoritarian heart's content) but eventually you learn, as I did. The game ends in 1935 iirc, but you can install mods that allow you to play into World War 2 and beyond. It's a 10/10 game. Even though the tutorials are almost useless.			",24,4,0,10,9,0,12

												Very deep Paradox grand strategy game set in the Victorian era of industrialisation and railways, in which you need to manage your populace, industry and politics to ensure your empire thrives. This period was also a brutal peroid of mechanical warfare with massive established nations fighting global wars. Although the other Paradox games like EU4 and CK2 are all unique in themselves I do find them a little bit repetitive because the gameplay a matter of witnessing new events and fighting wars, there is often not that much to do when not in conflict otherwise. CK2 has the advantage of a great intrigue system and EU4 has lovely graphics and GUI, but this Victoria 2 game has depth! It keeps you thinking on your feet all the way through to the late game and so far I have not had any time when I havent had a lot to do. So for me Victoria 2 is the Paradox game I love the most, I think its the only game where I cant see any gameplay flaws at all, I love the era, and I love the depth of the game which is unrivalled in any strategy game I have played to date.Watch Quill18's Japan Vic2 game on Youtube and I dare you not be be intrigued.

												Victoria II is a great game, and it only took me 1 hour of a serious match to get a hang of the infantry brigades mechanic.I was playing as Texas, and I put Texan Texas on a Military Focus (Promote Soldiers) and well... I was able to train more troops.I'm going to keep playing.10/10 would play as Texas again.All of the mechanics are rather easy to learn, you just need to figure it all out.

												When I first tried to run the game it wouldn't work but there is a posted fix for Vic II in the forums. After I did this fix the game runs fine now YAY!  Now I can get busy on the game and post a review about the game itself once i've played it enough.Ok now after I have reviewed the full tutorial and played my first game I am going to post a real review.I decided to go over the whole tutorial before playing, I figured it wouldn't all stick one time through (it is a lot) but I would get a general clue as to everything in the game. The game does have a steep learning curve, but after my first try I say it's worth it. It's a very involving game trying to really run everything in a country.  Politics, Industry, Income, Population, army and Technolgy. I did try to move a little too fast in acquiring new territory and got myself in hot water and ended up losing. But, I had so much fun trying to keep my people happy and budget balanced along with trying to build up infrastructure that I can't wait to try again. I will be going over a few things in the tutorial first. I haven't played with the DLC content as yet. But, I highly recommend this game if you love in depth strategy and don't mind actually having to do tutorials and maybe watch some videos too.			",43,36,5,22,28,1,30

												hi guys i work for IGS (international Game Station) and im here to talk about the graphically intense, mind blowing first person shooter known as victoria II. i starting playing Victoria II in the early 50s right after WWII and about the time my family and i were escaping bagota to avoid religious persecution. anyway, the second i got a 360 no scope headshot i was addicted. This game focuses around William Gregson and his eternal quest to rescue Queen Victoria Of Manning From the evil cat gonorrhea. this game has great quickscope mechanics and has a similar playstyle to games such as farming tycoon and FarmVille: PIzza party. Ive really enjoyed this game and cant wait for the sequal Victoria II: 2!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Victoria II is a grand strategy game by Paradox, a development studio with a fetish for grand strategy based in historical settings. After clocking in 109 hours, I feel confident in calling it one of my favorite games.The historical period, the gameplay mechanics of running an economy and managing politics and waging war is very well done, the design, the music, it's all superb!However, there are complaints to be had.Firstly, the Infamy syatem. It's actually a good system, working similary to World Tension in HoI4 or Coalitions in EU4. Infamy is gained by several actions, such as having war goals discovered by the international community, removing nations from your sphere, certain event options, etc. The issue with the system is that once your Infamy reaches 25.00, a coalition WILL come after you. I feel that the limit for that should be 50 or 40, perhaps 35. This would allow for a much more active experience in the game.Secondly, DLC. Vic2 is one of those games where the DLC is a MUST. So, you'd have to purchase not only Vic2, but A House Divided and Heart of Darkness for the full experience. I got the full Vic2 bundle while it was on sale, but I cannot deny that the DLCs' necessity and price is an issue (a prevalent issue with most, if not all, Paradox titles).Aside from those two grievences, the game is highly entertaining and intellectually stimulating. If you like grand strategy...Why are you reading this? Go get it already. Stop reading and buy Victoria II. NOW, I SAY!			",2,0,0,5,2,0,3

												This game is NOT for everyone; it is mind numbingly complex, rewarding careful planning. I can't say that I have played much of it yet, but I have played a lot of Hearts of Iron III as Germany, France, UK, Soviets, and the US. What I learned from HOI3 is not only is the US the player to be, but starting in 1936 is NOT early enough. That realization has led me to V2. In 1836 the US has not yet reached the goal of Manifest Destiny. The West is still wild, much of it held by Mexico. The Civil War has not been fought, and the goal that I have as the US player is to avoid it altogether. The Grand Campaign extends right through the First World War. Instead of practicing isolationist policies, I want to see the US become ""world cop"" as soon as possible. Taking that position in HOI3 worked for me, and I want to see that approach work in this game. For me the biggest mistake of World War II occured in 1936 when the US and the Allies let the fascists overthrow Republican Spain. Defending Spain would have made the Allied position MUCH stronger in 1940. Similarly, avoiding the Civil War would have made the US much stronger in the next century.			",52,8,0,26,10,1,44

												Really ♥♥♥♥ing good grand strategy game. Can be really difficult if you don't know what you're doing. Also you can form the German Empire (greatest empire of all time) which is a definite plus. 11/10 gg.P.S. If you're just getting this game, China is the easiest country to play as, ESPECIALLY once you modernize. I definitely reccomend you start your first playthrough as China.			",29,4,0,11,12,0,9

												Victoria II, yet another masterful game from the company that dictates the ""Grand Strtegy"" genre. This game has many realistic situations and options the allow for countless hours of gameplay. Ofter times, I think to myself ""Where did my entire day go"" while playing. Granted that overall the game is amazing, it does have some flaws. Rebels are a serious issue that Paradox desperately needs to fix in Victoria III (if we ever get it). I'll go over some general pros and cons of this game:PROS-Great gameplay-Pick any country and guide them through history (or alternate history)-Great powers have a ton of decisions-Easy to mod-TONS of great/fun mods to play-Mods patch issues with the vanilla game-Every country offers a different expirience CONS-Rebels arouse too often and in way to large numbers (I've had over 3/4 of my population become rebels)-Populations are unrealistic (China is the only country exceeding 1 million population)-The warscore is broken (Warscore measures how well you are doing in a war and the higher it is, the better deals you can get during a peaceoffer. However, sometimes you will be over the required warscore and the country will not surrender even if you have 100% of their provinces under your control.)-Countries with a low starting literacy rate fall far behind in technology-The UK never leaves the #1 spot on the country ranking-Rebels don't make sense (for example, after you formed Germany you will get ""Prussian Nationalists"" which want to liberate Prussia from Germany. Historically, it was Prussia and the Prussian people who wanted to form Germany in the first place.)***THERE ARE MODS THAT FIX A LOT OF THE CONS/ISSUES*** ",90,6,0,12,12,0,20

												A very contrarian veiw of history that really makes you realize how backwards europeans are. The best countries to start out as are Advanced african ones like Sokoto so you can create your colonial empire and bring civilization to the Europeans. Chinese are also a good start and can become the number one industrial opwer in a year or two. The UK should only be attempted by really experienced players because their empire is spread out and they are uncivilized and have almost no technology. A good middle ground is probabbly the Ottoman empire who have some tech problems but are civilized like the Africans.Black man's burden simulator 1836.			",82,17,0,11,25,0,29

												This game is loads of fun and  provides a good challenge for anyone wanting a campaign map only total war experience or a game that makes you think politically. The tutorial is nice, there are so many contires you can choose from, 125 at the beginning and that can even increase. The political system is good and so is deplomacy.My only complaint is that the resource trading system is hard to use and isnt well explained but that might just be me :p ",65,16,0,15,23,1,29

												Ok, this is going to be a difficult review.  On the one hand, I am sure that this game is very satisfying experience to anyone who can understand it.  However, on the other hand, this is not a friendly game to anyone not familiar with the genre bout would like to experience it.You can read the tutorials the game provides you and they are very detailed and tell you everything about everything in the panals up top but they don't do a good job of explaining how it all meshes together into a game.  It's like trying to fly a jet while reading the instruction manual on what all the buttons do.  It may be comprehensive, but you are no closer to learning how to fly it then when you started.I've watched several let's play ""How to play this game for beginners"" and I am still no closer to understanding then I was when I started.  I've also read several sites trying to explain it all to no avail.  Everyone starts out doing exactly what the tutorial does.  Explaining for a full hour what all the top panels do.  It still does not help me.  In fact, I usually start nodding off when they get to the diplomatic screen...This game needs a ""Practice Game for Newbs"" where it kind of holds your hand as you play showing you what you need to do or what you can do when certain events start happening.  Your armies not getting the supplies they need?  Here's what you need to do or here's a few things that you can do to help with that.If this game had something like that, I would probably give this game a thumbs up but instead, I need to give it a thumbs down.

												if your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			",9,2,0,2,12,0,10

O jogo é muito difícil para quem não está acostumado com o sistema da Paradox, mas depois de muito tentar você irá aprender e perceberá que quanto mais jogar mais coisa terá para aprender (como todos os jogos da Paradox). Ele traz questões políticas, militares e um contexto histórico sólido e real, apesar que no decorrer do jogo o mundo não vai ser igual como estava no começo. Um dos melhores jogos da Paradox!

												Before I bought the steam version I probably put a few hundred hours into this game.

												One of the most detailed modern civilization simulators available, Victoria II is all about economics and European ""balance of power"" politics. A big part of the game is guiding your nation through its industrial revolution and transitioning from an economy that relies on skilled craftsmen to one that can sustain huge factories. The game does a good job of creating a dynamic interaction between the economy, politics, and society. Don't expect too much of an overt narrative though - as in Europa Universalis, the story of your nation will be created through numbers, charts, and events. How you frame the story relies mostly on your own imagination - kind of like making your own head canon. Notable challenges include recreating Japan's rise to power through the Meiji Restoration, weathering the American Civil War, and building the British Empire. There's plenty of room to break history too! Fans of the Crusader Kings or Europa Univeralis series will know that Paradox is really good at creating systems that allow you to have fun rewriting history. You can create a communist United Kingdom, fight for Indian or Southeast Asian independence and industrial power, or build an empire to resist the Western colonization of Africa. Some histories are harder to rewrite than others - but this is a game that rewards practice and experience, and with enough of those almost anything is possible.Victoria II comes with a ""brick wall"" style learning curve - if you've played Europa Universalis before and can remember what it was like to first learn how to be good at that game, expect to experience that again. I'm still not very good at this game with only 14 hours registered, but it's fun (despite the frustration) to learn a new system. If you don't like feeling frustrated, I suggest looking up tutorials online because this game's systems are very complex for a newcomer. On the other hand, if you like learning new things and don't mind feeling like a total idiot, or if you don't mind having to scrap whole games' worth of progress to start over, then just dive in and experiment. Trust me, the game will let you know when you've lost. The huge variety of settings and the specific challenges that different nations face ensure that you'll never be lacking inspiration for a new game.Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to create a Romanian superpower to unite the Balkan states.

												Victoria II is a grand strategy game which spans one hundred years of history, from 1836 to 1936. The game allows a player to start as any nation which existed in 1836 (or 1861, if the DLC ""A House Divided"" has been downloaded and installed, and yes, that includes the CSA). The player can explore any avenue that they wish to pursue for achieving the lofty goal of ""Great Power"" status. One can dominate the Industrial Revolution(s) by becoming a factory-filled powerhouse; conquer every nation around them through decades of war; colonize Africa, Asia, and the Pacific islands; or skillfully manipulate their scientific progress and culture to become one of the most advanced nations on the planet. None of this, however, is in any way easy. Victoria II's excellence comes at the cost of enormous complexity. It can be daunting for a new player to memorize the various intricacies of economics, politics, diplomacy, and the like. Furthermore, the game is built to accurately simulate the chosen time period, and that means that rival nations will attempt to check the player at every turn. Your population's happiness and your national budget are also large concerns. Money is difficult to come by without hard work (or cheesing the system), and if the general populace finds itself outraged by your decisions one too many times, they'll take up arms and demonstrate to you why our modern world has so few monarchies anymore. Whatever goal you set your sights on, you will have to fight for it. It make take a long time to gain enough experience to excel at this game.That doesn't mean that Victoria II isn't a fun game. On the contrary. It's an incredibly fun game. The thrills of just barely beating a rival to that last colonial province, starting as a small country and forming a larger nation like Italy or Germany, or just messing around with history in general are what give Victoria II its charm. No game is ever exactly the same, so each campaign is a new adventure. Who knows what might happen? Maybe Sweden will become a global communist superpower. Maybe Mexico will start the Second World War by invading Greek Nigeria. Maybe Afghanistan will become world-renowned for its brilliant artists and rich cultural developments, while France lives in infamy as the nation that destroyed the USA. Whatever path you choose to lead your nation down, you can rest assured in two things: One, it will be a long and hard battle, as it was for any nation during those times to ascend to greatness. Two, it will most certainly be worth it.A final caveat: The base game by itself is somewhat...flawed. Purchasing the DLCs ""A House Divided"" (which adds Civil War content, revamps the economic and political systems, adds casus belli fabrication, and more) and ""Heart of Darkness"" (which vastly improves the colonization system, adds international crises which can be resolved through negotiation or combat, and other things) will lead to a much, much more rewarding experience.

												I went with the U.K for some time, appearently infamy doesn't matter with them since they are just so big of an empire that all you need to do is wait for white peace and then declare war and spread not caring about going over even 100 infamy. Evntually I satrt a new game go with U.K and play as Canada. I got anihilated by the U.S and U.K is doing nothing so I am not doing that again, unless I were to make a mod doing something about that... Well after that I tried Japan, after the first try with them I had Korea and parts of Arabia, then stopped playing Japan for whatever reason. Then I tried Siam, I got beaten by the Chinese for expanding right next to them.Then I try South America because Risk logic. Argentina, Chile, and Brazil are so good in my opinion. Now playing as these countries I ought to pay attention to Infamy since the one time I was Brazil and went too far then everyone declares war on me, never played Brazil again. So Argentina ends up being my favourite country and is the first thing I mod and I made infamy nothing to worry about by giving me cores, and then I formed a new nation just because mods, flags never work in my mods for some amount of reasons. Well I end up being a nation that has the lands of Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay, and poor ol' Bolivia. I remember the one time I made a game allied with everyone in South America except for Bolivia and made a non-reasonable crusade against them, five years later I just annex them then betray just about everyone in the south of South America.Now I have tried Mexico a few times and none of the times have I succesfully taken Texas, one time I have complete control over Texas but then U.S interferes nearly last second, I really want to make mods that will make the U.S not so full of military power. Also the only reason why I would ever suport C.S.A. Well this is my experience on the game but to make this an actual review, the game isn't all world domination like I originally thought, no instead you wait for Cassus-Belli I think it's called and then you decide if you want to declare war without gaining infamy, or go ahead and get infamy it's really up to you. Being a Great Power gives you a great advantage when it comes to diplomacy, sometimes it can be fun to get a lot of money coming in and just looking through the wars supporting whichever side by giving war subsidies. Sometimes it's hard to industrialize most likely because you're political party won't pay for building factories, well if your a HM government you can change to some party that will let you or somehow get a revolt and change governments that way. It can be fun colonising but the French are just too quick with colonising in my opinion. Playing as a low country can be fun as a challenge yet it is frustrating, especially when some country annihilates your only hopes of winning wars. Encouragement is useful yet I feel as if it is something barely thought of.Well that's pretty much all, my advice would be if you're going against an uncivilized nation or country, whatever. Check if any Great Power has friendly relations with them or has them in sphere, now if none do and you are not going to wait for a Cassus-Belli or you know you are not going to since I so far only get those by border incidents then declare war through ""demand concession"" way less infamy given. There is also demand protectorate or something, yeah do that too.			",41,11,0,13,12,0,13

												I have yet to try other Paradox strategies, but I can already say I'm really enjoying  Victoria II	 . Before buying the steam version I had a physical copy which I got for free from a deal. It had both Victoria II + A House Divided and Victoria I + Revolutions. What made me buy the steam version was that I could not enhance the retail edition with Heart of Darkness which is a must for a full Vicky experience. I just wasn't sure if the copy of HoD I could buy was compatible with it. Go figure, I bought the steam version alongside two DLCs. No regrets.Before you actually think of buying this or any other Paradox developed game you must take one thing into consideration.  Paradox grand strategies are known for their rather steep-learning curve  I'm looking at you, Hearts of Iron III...	 and rather confusing interface . While the tutorial might sort of give you a little pat to the right way it's possible that you may want to look up a guide on YouTube, as the former doesn't cover some important topics such as  Colonizing	 which plays a vital role in becoming a great power later on. After you know what the hell you're doing you will really enjoy this game. It's fun to lead your country becoming a contender in the ever so harsher competition for world dominance. If you're into grand strategies then this game is for you.			",47,9,0,6,5,0,18

												This game is just plan amazing it is a step up from turn based startegy games such as Civilazation 5 which is also an amazing game so that I also suggest, also a step up from XCOM Enemy Unknown. But one minor problem for people with not much time and just want a quick game. It is an One Hundred Year game and you can choose up to a 5x speed which is about 5 days per 3.5 seconds. Also the huge learning curve. What I suggest is getting it but taking your time on time off to learn and play and a huge game is just so much fun. A great game and also try games like the upcoming East vs West which is the 5th game in the Paradox Grand Campaign which I'm playing to start very soon once I get Europa Universalis 4 which I also recommend. There is also Hearts of Iron 4 that comes out later in 2014 and then there is Crusader Kings 2 all have huge learning curves but all once learned are just plain amazing games. I hope you enjoy every part of it! :D			",126,11,1,25,43,0,33

												Victoria 2 is an excellent GSG title which will have your mouth gasp at it's complexity. Victoria 2 has a fully working emulated world market, which changes dynamically according to events that happen in your world that YOU control. For instance, let's say you go to war against the US, this would increase the demand for, say, machine parts, gun parts, etc etc. The complexity of this game put me off it for a bit, but once they get the EU4 -> Vic2 convertor going I am sure to learn it fully. Great game, as far as I am concerned.			",87,24,3,11,16,2,11

												As I have said to Johnny, fun is not the correct word to use when describing paradox games. Watching your nation industrialise, guiding it through colonial wars of aggression and, most importantly of all, watching as your nations colours spread across the map are not fun activities. They are however incredibly interesting and quite enthralling. Play as shogunate Japan and meld them into the new British Empire. Take the CSA and ""live your life"". Create an Austrian empire stretching from the Baltic sea to the Adriatic. All of this can be done, and has been done by myself.As this is my favourite period in history, I may be a little biased, but I would have to say that this game fights with Civ 5 for the top seat at my table.

												Update:In a nutshell, Victoria II can be considered the greatest Grand Strategy game ever made if not for it's lack of update and outdated GUI. Pros:- Ability to manage internal and external politics of your country as well as your population- Ability to manage production and good as well as trade- Ability to lead armies and research a varied tech tree Cons- Lack of updates makes mods the only avenue for bugfixes- Lack of mod updates as modders moved on to more supported games like Crusader Kings II and Europa Universalis IV- Outdated graphics and GUI makes some actions seem convoluted. Bear in mind, even with the cons here, it still trumps both CK2 and EU4 in terms of re-playability and the variety of strategies you can employ. The only problem now is the heart of the game, which are mods are sadly lacking.It is still a recommendation for the game nonetheless. You wouldn't have truly played a Grand Strategy game until you've played Victoria 2. I'm certain Victoria 3 will be one of the greatest Grand Strategy game of the decade if it ever comes out.------------------------------------Old review:I've played CK2, EU4 and Victoria 2, the few more recent Grand Strategy games from Paradox. I can say that Victoria 2 is the ""de facto"" Grand Strategy game from Paradox and probably of all recent ones too. You can delve deep into the economics of your nation while managing your diplomacy of your next conquest, all this while making an industrial powerhouse out of your population.In short, if you're a fan of Grand Strategy games. Get this until EU4 expansions fixes all of its micromanagement problems (fleet/buildings etc).Oh, I've been playing Civ all this while and I'm never going back to them after playing this.

												I originally was planning on getting Crusader Kings 2, but I was glad I purchased this instead. Made by the same devloper and publisher who made Crusader Kings 2, this game does not dissapoint. The game revolves around the turn of the century in the mid-late 1800s to the mid 1900s; following real-time events and being very detailed to the last aspect of the game. It may take a little bit to figure out the game's mechanics, but once you do the possiblities are endless. I remember first playing as the CSA (Confederate States Of America) in the house divided expansion, and took over the rest of the US. The only problem I had with the game is that it is almost unplayable without the two expansions ""A House Divided"" and ""Heart Of Darkness."" The other expansions are just soundtracks or military skins that are utterly useless, unless you really want them. The music is very good; with some songs reaching cinematic levels of quality. The game is over all one of my favorites with endless possiblities, great/very detailed game mechanics, and a very strong story following real-time events that you can change. If you don't want to empty your wallet for games like Crusader Kings 2 or Europa Universalis, don't want a Historical RPG that's extremely hard, and want to shape the world in your image, then this game is for you.9/10			",63,10,2,4,26,1,9

												Update:In a nutshell, Victoria II can be considered the greatest Grand Strategy game ever made if not for it's lack of update and outdated GUI. Pros:- Ability to manage internal and external politics of your country as well as your population- Ability to manage production and good as well as trade- Ability to lead armies and research a varied tech tree Cons- Lack of updates makes mods the only avenue for bugfixes- Lack of mod updates as modders moved on to more supported games like Crusader Kings II and Europa Universalis IV- Outdated graphics and GUI makes some actions seem convoluted. Bear in mind, even with the cons here, it still trumps both CK2 and EU4 in terms of re-playability and the variety of strategies you can employ. The only problem now is the heart of the game, which are mods are sadly lacking.It is still a recommendation for the game nonetheless. You wouldn't have truly played a Grand Strategy game until you've played Victoria 2. I'm certain Victoria 3 will be one of the greatest Grand Strategy game of the decade if it ever comes out.------------------------------------Old review:I've played CK2, EU4 and Victoria 2, the few more recent Grand Strategy games from Paradox. I can say that Victoria 2 is the ""de facto"" Grand Strategy game from Paradox and probably of all recent ones too. You can delve deep into the economics of your nation while managing your diplomacy of your next conquest, all this while making an industrial powerhouse out of your population.In short, if you're a fan of Grand Strategy games. Get this until EU4 expansions fixes all of its micromanagement problems (fleet/buildings etc).Oh, I've been playing Civ all this while and I'm never going back to them after playing this.

Unless you find a WWI scenario and launch it there is very little you can do unless you play the Austrians.A good buy for 20$ or less for the complete version.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Victoria 2 is by far my all time favourite game. Period. It is a grand strategy game set in the dawn of the Victorian era. France has been defeated just twenty years prior, the Ottoman Empire is dying, German nationalism is on the rise, and the British Empire is the greatest power in the world. In this game, you can click on any of the 150+ countries on the map and hop right in. if you are into strategy, then definetely pick it up (with all the expansions!). After learning the ropes, you will likely fall in love with this game			",424,68,5,71,85,2,150

												Absolute masterpiece of a game. There are a few problems here and there but this game tries to grasp so many concepts at once and it does so beautifully.The game is not as complex as many people will have you believe. There are a lot of statistics but it is through these statistics that the game comes alive.You can see how your population is divided into these separate social classes, what their concerns are, how well they are doing, their religion, political views, etc. And it fits extremely well with the period because the 19th century was a great period of innovations and ideas.Different political parties have different abilities and functions.Factories can built built directly or coaxed into creation. Unemployment is bad, etc...Any fan of a nation simulator should get this game. DLC is recommended/required.			",86,14,0,19,25,1,21

												This game is just plan amazing it is a step up from turn based startegy games such as Civilazation 5 which is also an amazing game so that I also suggest, also a step up from XCOM Enemy Unknown. But one minor problem for people with not much time and just want a quick game. It is an One Hundred Year game and you can choose up to a 5x speed which is about 5 days per 3.5 seconds. Also the huge learning curve. What I suggest is getting it but taking your time on time off to learn and play and a huge game is just so much fun. A great game and also try games like the upcoming East vs West which is the 5th game in the Paradox Grand Campaign which I'm playing to start very soon once I get Europa Universalis 4 which I also recommend. There is also Hearts of Iron 4 that comes out later in 2014 and then there is Crusader Kings 2 all have huge learning curves but all once learned are just plain amazing games. I hope you enjoy every part of it! :D			",126,11,1,25,43,0,33

												Kings of Strategy, Paradox Interactive's late modern era game. Historical events and options are plentiful. A shorter timespan than most PI games, only 100 years, from 1836 to 1936, as opposed to the four centuries that Crusader Kings and Europa Universalis have. Starting just at the rise of Pax Britannica, just after the falls of the French and Spanish Empires, there's so much to do in this game. Form the German Empire. Try and stay an Absolute Monarchy through the rise of Liberalism, Socialism, Communism and Fascism. Act out America's Manifest Destiny and partake in the Civil War. Play the Chinese Empire and try and modernise and resist foreign influences. Play the Ottoman Empire and prevent your backslide into historical obscurity. There's so much to do, and you've got to make your own goals. In usual Paradox style there's a ton of super-complex systems that you need to know, but if you get a handle on it, there's so much depth and replayabilitiy to be done.			",128,33,1,27,43,0,51

												It's the year 1904. Bohemia-Moravia has cried out for independence and I, Great Britain, have answered their call. To my surprise, France and Russia joined Austria-Hungary in keeping Bohemia-Moravia oppressed. This will be a great war.By the year 1910, my nation had built the first tank, aeroplane, and vehicle factories. Out production was the third best in the world, but our manpower....Our manpower was unmatched. As the nation grew, I did everything I could to make my population love their home. I wanted immigrants and did anything I could to attract them. My government became liberal, and even though my military spending is lower due to the ""anti-military"" liberal policy, my population is the highest by 65 million. The sheer number and quality of Great Britains soldiers have allowed me to take northern France and defend India from Russia. However, France has gas, and I have no defense against gas. I have lost double the men that France. While I am winning the war, I may not be if my researchers can't formulate a defense soon.This is Victoria 2. Probably one of, if not the most amazing game I've ever played.			",237,12,1,53,39,0,89

I lucked out, but right after the helper, the normal troll crowd started. So, get this if you are willing to have to manuelly fix it, DO NOT get it if you are nto willing to, since otherwise, it is completely UNPLAYABLE without the fix, it will jsut freeze on opening, and crash, nothing more.

												The game is alright, but there are problems with it. Nothing is wrong with the game itself, unless you're only playing the base game. Paradox likes to leave key features out of their games and later on throw it into a DLC. It's good for fans who can spend 20$ on a base game then 29$ on two DLCs, but it is very dissapointing for those who can't. If you want to buy it, it is a good game, just wait for a sale or something.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Definitely the least of Paradox's most recent grand strategies in my opinion, but it's still a lot of fun to mess around with domestic issues. I have the feeling my lack of success with diplomacy and war is really just due to my lack of trying rather than any fault of the game, but I'd prefer to play one of Paradox's simular games that I already know how to play.

												I like this game. But like everything else from this damn company (except Hearts of Iron games) it has some things that make it impossible.1. Rebels: Jacobing rebels are almost impossible to beat when they rise up. 2. Weird things ruining fun: Such as your ally that you have rights to go trough with your military.3. UK being indestructible.4. Dice rolls: Amazing general, defense bonus, fort, rivers, great technology against bunch of illiterate hordes, smaller army. You loose, why ? Dice rolled 9 for the enemy and 0 for you.Amognst other things.			",113,10,0,3,17,1,14

												Pretty much my introduction to all things Paradox. While the game has a significant learning curve - and arguably some game mechanics that feel either dated or just needlessly bothersome, it is definitely worth a look.You don't even need to play a major country to have fun - You can easily play a small nation systematically manipulating the stock markets by buying goods while they are at a surplus and selling them off when a war breaks out, or new technology pushes for mass consumption.It also has some of the best music in a game of its genre hands down, which definitely helps with long game sessions.

												I'd like to give Victoria 2 a positive review, but at this time, I just cannot bring myself to do so. Positives of the game in my eyes:-Economics are fantastic-If you like EU4, but want a deeper level of economics, then this game certainly fills that role perfectly.-Colonization is fun-Pretty self explanitory here. Competing with other great powers for the rich coast of Africa is a fun contest of will and strength.-Taking a nation from ""civilized"" to ""Great Power"" is amazing-I took Japan and made it into a great power, easily overpowering Spain and the USA in the conquest of China.Negatives of the game in my eyes:-Horrible amount of popup events-I understand that you get random events, sometimes negative and sometimes positive, but when you get the same dang event popping up fifty-seven times in twenty minutes, it makes for a lousy impression. I've heard that its due to some of the DLCs, but that's still no excuse for this to occur so often.-Great powers gang up- You can be helping the smallest of nations with some small war, and suddenly you'll find yourself facing the UK and bloody every other great power on Earth for no other reason than the fact that you're at war. Others may find this realistic, I find it annoying, especially if I'm the one being attacked by the smaller nation.-Literacy rate makes or breaks you-I realize that I do not yet quite understand the full concept of literacy in Victoria 2, but I hate that you can have a full education budget and dedicate all of your resources to try and build up the literate people, but it will still take you decades (and often longer) to go up a few percentage points.-Unstable game-Pretty self explanitory. This game crashes every so often, though it the biggest complaint with this is that mods cause it to crash like a boss.After all is said and done, do I regret buying this game? No, I certainly do not. However, I do think that you should ask yourself if you like grand strategy games and if you are willing to look past the flaws. It can be a really fun experiance, but you'll have to not get annoyed at the crashes or the endless popup events.			",74,9,0,19,56,1,42

												I enjoyed it.. when it worked. Unfortunately this game is broken as far as I can tell. At the moment it crashes on launch and I still don't know why as I've done all the the troubleshooting in their ""Discussions'. Not only that but it crashes pretty frequently even when iit does work and my pc is only about a year old!Gameplay is interesting although as someone who hasn't played a lot of these types of games, it was often unclear how some things affected the overall result. And I expected the navy to play a much larger role due to the era but it can pretty much be skipped if you're not surrounded by water. Also it kinda has that feeling when you play a board/card game with your friend and their SO and they automatically team up against you and won't do anything to really threaten each other. Except ""your friend and their SO' is pretty much all of the AI in this game. The battles they have seem somewhat just tokens and the alliances are solid. Not once did any of my ""Allies' back me up when I was being attacked or attacking. Maybe I'm just playing wrong but I feel like that is something the game should point out or explain why things are happening.So to sum up, I enjoyed it and I'd probably still play it if it wasn't broken but it IS broken and it takes a long time to learn to play and an even longer time to find out you've done something that has made the match unwinnable.

												Game is simply too buggy and unstable in its current iteration. It seems as though it may be fun if it worked somewhat consistently, but having tested it on now 5 different machines, I have 2 machines it will never properly start a game on, and 3 in which it crashes every 4 minutes on average (longest run about 15 minutes).All 5 machines more than meet the requirements for the game, and one of them was on a brand new install of windows 10 (a machine I use just for these test purposes).I have read that deleting the contents of the map/cache folder from both the Steam library location and the users documents helps the issue, but in my testing this has yet to help in over 2 dozen attempts; if anything, this seems to make the time between crashes shorter on the rare occasions it will actually load a game, though that is likely simply a fluke.This game came highly reviewed from friends of mine who played it long ago, so I hope that whatever is causing these issues is resolved. For now, however, this is simply an exercise in frustration, and I would not even consider the game to be playable.			",225,55,0,57,25,3,50

												I would NOT recommend Victoria II, however...I WOULD recommend Victoria II if you have the two major DLCs, ""A House Divided"" (AHD) and ""Heart of Darkness"" (HOD).Even with these, Victoria II is still a bit of a mess - but fortunately not the huge steaming♥♥♥♥♥♥pile that the vanilla game is.Seriously, for all Vicky's flashy stastics, historical nerd porn, and awesome technology tree, it has MAJOR flaws, and I mean pretty ♥♥♥♥ing major flaws.I'm surprised certain design elements got past the final stages of development for this game. And, furthermore, considering HOD is essential for at least slightly realistic battles and therefore more fair wars, HOD is a paid patch. There is a big problem with feedback. One of your provinces is being sieged? Good luck finding out which one it is in your massive global empire. Oh, and that unit finished that siege eight months ago. Oh, suddenly we're losing money. Oops, forgot to upgrade that colonization effort to a protectorate and now somebody else has taken it.Even with HOD, the colonization mechanics are still rubbish at best. There is no real historical accuracy at all. Now, I know it's a game where you're supposed to create your own history, and that's fine, but why the ♥♥♥♥ is Russia colonizing Ethiopia?The diplomacy system is S H I T E. It's simply awful. The diplomacy points system makes little to no sense for the era and the 'Very Unlikely/Unlikely/Maybe/Likely/Very Likely' system is terrible. But the worst aspect of this game are your allies. They are pointless.Playing as Portugal (which in EUIV is a fun, challenging nation to play and has an interesting history in the Victorian era), I sent an alliance offer to Britain. hey accepted with 'Likely'. The Netherlands almost immediately declares war on me and Britain ♥♥♥♥s off like a little ♥♥♥♥♥. Not only would this NEVER HAPPEN in real life considering Britain and Portugal have been allies since the late 1300s, but also because they are both enemies of the Dutch in this time period.And guess what? Suddenly France, Spain, every man and his dog are at war with me. Not fair. I lost all my colonies in Africa and lost Douros to the bloody Spanish.That sucks. The AI really hates you in this game. No joke. I think it genuinley hates the player.Something I will praise is the economy system and the factory/industry mechanic, which are both unique and well done. War itself, if balanced, is actually pretty fun and managing the politcal system is rewarding and captivating.But, this game is outdated and mostly broken. I would say you should wait until those Swedish ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s at Paradox release Victoria III, or buy EUIV if it's on sale. Despite it's flaws, Victoria II can be fun if played with both of the major DLCs and a lot of patience. Oh, and maybe some cheats because sometimes the game is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I feel like I need to send it to a mental hospital.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game itself seems highly enjoyable. I say seems because I just couldn't get this game to work with Win 8. Read online that deleting the map cache folder would get it working but still doesn't open with steam. Directly opened it via the executable file and it runs for about twenty mins and then just crashes every time. Wish Steam would actually test games before they put them up for sale and/or at least says may not be compatible with certain versions of Windows.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is good, but only on the hands of the patient ones.I'm beginner at Paradox games, first is EU3, and I'm good at it. I try Victoria 2, and it is bad. Bad not as in bad gameplay but bad as in my inability to fully understand the trading and production system of Victoria 2. Sure, there is tutorial, but it is still not enough for me. And then there's the fact that there is no Steam Workshop, which is understandable as Victoria 2 is an old game and its fanbase (according to my own opinion) is not as huge as Crusader Kings or Europa Universalis. I want to recommend this game, but in the end, I just can't.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am a fan of this age and everything about this game is great except when massive rebbelions come in, they are absolute atrocity in this game and they destroy the gameplay, for example you win a big war against a country and incorporate their territory to you country, what happens next is impossible because there is no way in hell that after destroying 150k stacks to 0 and all of their mobilization forces there is no way in hell that after just 1 month, make it even less they raise 500k rebbels in those areas and they just wipe your asses, ergo im giving it bad recommendation even tho i love this game, cause paradox never fixed the one thing community constantly asked.

												Since Steam doesn´t allow anything els but clear thumbs down or up, i´ll have to settle for a thumb down. Why? Because there was a ctd straight after the installation finished, therefore making the game unplayable. A solution can be easily found, so you might wonder why this  would suffice to give a thumb down for an otherwise very good game.The answer:This ctd has been known for at least four years now and has still not been fixed by paradox. I should not have to fix some unavoidable ctd straight after purchasing a game and this has in fact been the only game (with 80 in the library) where I ever experienced something like this. Some of my games are even as old as Iám myself, yet non caused such a hassle.			",64,36,0,26,25,0,38

												As a huge fan of the EU series, Paradox' initial games, I was excited to try the highly praised Victoria II but alas it was nothing like the fun of EU. On the surface the game looks very similar to Paradox' other grand strategy games but there appears to be a clear lack of things to do in order to propel forward the gameplay. EU 1 & 2 were prettied up spreadsheets but they managed to hide this fact very well underneath a fun game - with Victoria II they do not succeed in this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												(Sigh) I love Paradox Games and this game is great... when/if it works...Problem is, newer systems cannot run this game. Full of glitches (mostly graphic and annoying flickers and the likes). First time I ever tried to get in touch with Paradox to get support. Multiple sign in accounts needed, page deletions and a bunch of pages under construction. To say the least, absolutely no support.DO NOT BUY!! (Unless you have an older 32-bit OS with a sub-par graphic card.... NVidia 9000 or older). You will get nothing but head aches.			",28,12,1,19,15,0,31

												I generally like strategy games, and I thought I would like this game but I really can't take it anymore. Part of the reason I tried this game is because it had a more complex economy, but the economy makes no sense.  When there is more demand than supply on the world market instead of the price increasing until supply meets demand, the game gives the countries with more ""prestige"" the products.  As a result, if you are a smaller country there are certain products that you can never access on the world market.  To build certain units like artillery, you need liquor and I waited for over fifty years trying to get liquor but I could never get it.There are only a handful of levers you have to control your country (although you have full control of the military) which makes some sense, but the levers you have available are very limited and kind of strange.  You get bombarded by events that happen in your country that that you get to choose a response that will nudge your country in a certain direction, but the choices often make no sense and the same choices pop up again, and again, and again, and again.  You get constatnly bombarded by silly questions so often that it drives me nuts.The tech tree is pretty dull, but I like that when you research a new tech, there are technologies that will be discovered later as a chance discovery.  In a nutshell, playing it just made me want to beat my head against a wall or go play Civilizations.			",31,5,0,2,3,0,1

You have to go to paradox.""  But you can ot contact Paradox directly.  You post a thread on a message board and you never hear from them again.

Your kind of ushered down the historical road.  the endless and I mean endless minutia and forced micro management kills this game.  The frequent ""**** you"" events, the incessant rebellions.

												I had high hopes for Vicky 2, since CK2 and EU4 are pretty solid games.  Vicky 2 is great when it comes to the economic build up and the complexities of Great Power diplomacy, but it falls (extremely) when military and basic AI comes into the fray.  Military is very messy and unorganized, something that I was surprised to see in a Pdox game.  I have heard players say it is micromanagement, but it isn't.  It comes down to very bad game design right down to the UI.  It is no wonder why the series hasn't had any rumors of a sequel since this was poorly executed.  If  a Vicky 3 ever arrives (unlikely) then I hope it takes cues from the solid vision from EU4.			",26,18,0,18,23,0,20

												No multiplayer support. I know how that sounds, but when you can't play through Stream then it's not supported. Of course there's work arounds, but you when you can't set up a direct IP even when all your firewalls are disabled, then that's not an option. When the ""best"" advice to make a AAA published game work is to use third party software that I've never heard of before, then that's not an option either. Have fun with your malware, but I'm opting out.			",164,39,1,83,59,3,90

												I do NOT recommend this game, because it did not load properly (It was missing a file).Steam will refund you for a game you played less than 2 hours. However, if you try to sort through their Ho Chi Minh trail of software support, it will take you more than that.Because I took over 2 hours trying to make it work, Steam will not refund me (and the PARADOX support link is a dead-end).Choose wisely. I have purchased 50 Steam selections, this was my first complaint, and Steam would not even consider a $9.99 refund.			",17,1,1,7,25,1,9

												Keep in mind that I have no DLC or Mods. At first the game was very fun. You can play as every faction on the map, you conquor, enlist generals, engage in politics and tech, the list goes on. I've never completed a campaign.. which begins the bad things about the game for my HP 2000 Notebook PC: My first campaign was as Ethiopia, very fun and attacking egypt in the South while the  Ottomans from the North. After the war was over and egypt was now a minor power, I decided to save my game and exit. The next day I load up the game and select Ethiopia to continue... crash. After trying to fix it, every time I select my save slot, it crashes... Well there goes an hour of post-napoleonic fun.. I start one as japan, three days later when I load it up.. same frustration with Ethiopia. As time passes and I keep loading up different factions, some time sooner or later.. crash!I wouldn't spend my money on the DLC when I don't know if it'll still crash. If you get the game while on sale, like I did, then you won't be as mad.My rating is 5/10 on sale, 4/10 for full price.. might as well use that for Europa IV			",17,1,0,9,4,0,17

												To start off, I don't normaly complain about games, and playing games such as CK2 and EU4 I was expecting a great game from Paradox. I paid £15 for the base game, but when I started playing I found there was barely anything in the game. It was like EU4 but with only the basic features. So, I thought I would pay the extra £15 for the Hearts of Darkness expansion, but when it downloaded the DLC, the launcher wouldn't launch. I then deleted the game and re-downloaded but it did the same. I restarted my computer then deleated the game, re-downloaded and realunched. The launcher worked and I happily clicked play. I then discovered that you need A House Divided to play. A game I wanted to play for £15 will end up costing me over twice as much and even then it still might not work. The thing that annoyed me was that steam said you could play HOD without AHD.IF YOU WANT TO BUY, BUY IN A STEAM SALE. DONT BUY IN SEPERATE PARTS!			",14,1,0,9,13,0,13

												Still new to this game and learning as I go. I like to play smaller nations and work to become a great nation, however this game does not encourage this. As soon there is some hope a greater nation declares war on you and all your progress is gone (dont know how realistic that is) Pity the UN wasnt formed yet. What I also found was unless your a great nation forming allies was a waste of time, once war is declared they all seem to disappear (simliar to what happens in Crusader Kings 2). I like to give this more time but I don't see it happening, maybe I will try to play a great nation but I prefer working my way to the top.			",0,1,0,1,9,0,6

												Well the first thing I have to say is Regret. I honestly shouldn't have wasted my 40 dollars on this game and should have bought more Crusader kings 2 dlcs.This game is VERY and when I say very I mean VERY boring.First the campaign time in this game is too short and the time they give you to actually have fun is even shorter since you need technology for colonization.I didn't feel the spark I did feel with Crusader kings 2.Not only is this game boring but even minor things can be irratating like I tried to subjugate Greece as the Ottomans and i was doing a great job keeping the british navy away and destroy the Russian army in  eastern europe I must have destroyed a army of 180 soldiers because they had 3 40 stacks and a couple 20s. At on point my Warscore was 45 and all I needed was 28 but the Russians wouldn't back down. Then I venture east and i see 140 MORE units in Mesopatamia.They have already occupied most of the east so I destroy some of their soldiers and regain some territory only to see that the Russians have 40k soldiers the easter europe again and my warscore is 30.No good events and you will spend most of your time looking at the screen counting the days taht go by in game.

												Do you feel like watching 4 hours of tutorials and reading guides for another 2?  If so, this game is for you!I normally wouldn't complain about investing the time to play a game... if the game actually paid off.  I found myself bored quickly bored.  There are several other games that have much better mechanics and keep game play interesting.  This is not Sid Meiers Civilization -- and in my opinion that would be the game to recommend.When I compare this to other strategy games, I see how the developers tried really hard, tried to add an original spin on things, and failed, failed, failed.  I suppose it's an honest effort compared to franchises that have bigger budgets to work with.  I really think this game could have been great if it were more intuitive, quicker paced with better action/events, and threw in some cut scenes and an expanded diplomatic section.The basic plot is to play as any country in the Victorian era.  The game really centers around the big powers of the day -- Britain, Russia, Germany, and a few others including America.  The game seems built to cater to players who will automatically pick a big power.  If, however, you pick a smaller or less influential country -- game play is like eating dry toast.There is a research system for ""national focus"" which lets you open up new technology and discoveries.  The options are well-thought out and historically appropriate.  The major flaw is the slow speed to finish one item of research.  I don't see how anyone can unlock and achieve all the national focus items even at the drawn-out slow pace of the game.  If we are being realistic, 2015 would not be 2015 as we know and live in it if it were based on the research portion.  So... fail.  Perhaps, there is another way, but with the hours of other things you have to learn, a dull tutorial, and lack of intuitivity, this just isn't happening.The political decision tree is very interesting with well thought out social and political reforms.  One's in-game choices will alter the political leanings of your population.  The problem I have with the political system is that many of the options are unavailable with many countries.  I suppose this is somewhat.... somewhat... realistic, however, it often leaves the player frustrated when trying to progress.Production is much the same as production in many other strategy games.  You import, export, and stockile resources.  You build factories if you are under a government system that can, or wealthy capitalists build them for you.  If you need a certain resource, you either buy it at market price or you go take over a country that has that resource.  Though, aggressive players might have advanced tactics for taking over the world, the game doesn't make hostile takeovers simple nor easy.  Also, it feels that if you produce goods and have spent your in-game time researching industrialization you are painting a bullseye on your back.  With the slow pace of research, you simply cannot have a strong military and a strong industry unless you are a super power.  This was how I lost Switzerland.... poor cuckoo clock makers.The military aspect of the game, by default, somewhat follows what happened in history.  Depending on what country you are playing you'll either be severely handicapped or very powerful.  The military options are decent and much more straight-forward than other game mechanics.  When I say straight forward, I do not mean easy.  Some countries seem fated to certain takeover despite a well thought out strategy.The diplomatic options were appealing to me.  The options included do expand the diplomatic choices a player can make.  This would be great if it weren't based on a points spent system that crawls far too slowly.There are some unique aspects to the mechanics of the game such as population militancy and choices that advance or curtial liberlism.  I am sure if I had more time to let my eyes glaze over waiting for something to happen, they might be appreciable features.All-in-all, if you are a big enough fan of this type of game, spend te extra to get Civilization or Europa or, my personal favourite Democracy 3.

												The game lacks of details in diplomacy, economy (export details are poor) what gets imported and what treaties the country is making. Also factory building only in developed nations possible, as if Japan wasnt that much developed. Lastly research takes too long.			",6,0,0,1,16,0,3

												The multiplayer (or lack of) absolutely ruins an otherwise decent strategy game. Single player can only be fun for so long, even with mods, before the mounting desire to play with friends gets the best of one. At this point you'll find it is impossible to play multiplayer because Paradox Interactive is incapable of writing halfway decent network code. This is evident in the fact that they thankfully switch to the Steam service with their newer games.In conclusion, if Johan wasn't so busy grubbing for shekels with all his DLC he could actually make decent games with working multiplayer. But hey, the Swedes love your money.			",357,71,18,41,50,1,71

												Failed to create a Graphics Device Exiting.....The very first challenge this game presented me with has left me stumped.Does anyone know how to beat the first boss?I have installed this game on multiple systems and also on multiple different operating systems. Literally have tried a Pentium IV with Windows XP, the Intel Duo Core with Windows 7, and a Intel i7 4790 with windows 8.1 and Windows 10, both with and without the update. This Game will not run past the load screen on a single one of these systems!!!!! Seriously? How the ♥♥♥♥ do you sell a Loading Screen and call it a game? This cannot be my fault.

												Five reasons this game is absolute s h i t e !1. I needed community support to even start the game.2. Game-mechanics are somewhat booring. Rather limited options for doing anything.3. Once you become a Great Power you must spend the rest of the game watching the influence interface, trying to jocky your sphere of influence into the AIs. About as fun as watching an intrument-panel on a random factory-machine.4. Every 5-20 seconds the game throws a splash-screen in your face, demanding you press ""confirm"" or make a choice that have a miniscule impact on your game. Until you do it will either lock the game in pause, or block your view while the game is still running.5. You have to go online to learn how to play the game.			",121,61,3,77,28,3,46

												I think the time period for this game is rather a bad choice. It's not set in the buildup to colonisation it's set in the height of the age of colonisation. While Africa is uncolonised the wealth of India makes Great Britain a extremely powerful country and already basically a free win. Your spammed with events that slightly increase/decrease liberalism in indervidual provinces not rly doing muchand you repeadly have elections that you can only slightly effect. The Sphere of influence is rather annoying and not the most useful. I played one game as Prussia and I got mass declared on and betrayed by my allies because I was too infamous. Despite only claiming and annexing Hesse. A Move Whitch by a look on the map you can tell shouldn't be a major issuePrefer EU4 whitch I am addicted too			",13,1,0,3,10,0,6

												I went through the tutorials and really liked the aspects of this game except for two things... army recruitment and declaring war.Both of these aspects are terrible. You can't just conscript/train soldiers - you have to convince your population that the career of a soldier is right for them. This increases the pool of soldiers from which you can field and later reinforce brigades.You can't declare war when you want to. You have to justify it, which takes time. Extremely annoying. All in all it's pretty crippling if you're wanting to invade your neighbors.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One key thing, paradox abandoned it.kinda slow compared to EU4 or CK2.Democracy is a drag, the elections bombard you with mssges.Technology does not reward the player enough and colonizing requires specific  ""inventions"".Thats another thing that bothers me ""inventions"", they suck I just wan't to colonize africa and the pacific but I cant because i require specific invention not a specific tech.*Note I do need techs, but the inventions are the most ""useful""Crisis happen either too often or not as often.Military battles are completly unpredictable, your odds might be in your favor but you might lose due to attrition, lack of supplies, lack of reinforcements, your enemy is or might be more advanced.Politics suck, most of the time is denouncing, raising influence, increase relations and trade.Pros (Updated. Since I wrote the cons first I will write the few things I enjoyed)You can create Byzantium (my personal favorite)Many forms of government.Fighting rebels is satisfiyingYou can create puppet governments out of coloniesFormable nations like california republic, austro-hungaria and Italy.I'm sorry to all of the fans, I really wish this was a great game but it's not.

												Victoria II isn't so much a game as an alternate history simulator.  The designers were obsessive about their historical accuracy and detail... they just forgot to design any significant gameplay around it.  There are quite a few nations you can play as, but unless you play as one of the 8 great world powers, your gameplay will consist of watching your country run itself and making small insiginificant nudges in certain directions until you get invaded by one of the 8 great world powers.In summary, if you love obscure history and games that play themselves, you'll love Victoria II.

												65 Hours into it and I still don't really know what I'm doing.  I've read wikia pages and the 15 scene tutorial.  I understand the concept but that's about it.  Took me probably 30 hours to figure out how the combat system works, very detailed but without an easy to use interface or even a help file that explains the differences in rows and support %'s there's no way to know what's going on.  Only reason I understand it is that wikia cleared it up.  Great concept of a game, I think the game mechanics are probably great if I could ever figure them out.  If this had a better interface or someway to explain things, I'd recommend it and possibly even give it a high score.  Since it doesn't, it's worthless to me.  2/10 for potential.  Better luck with victoria 3.			",94,12,3,27,30,2,53

												UhNot too sure what to write here so heres a recipe for Pancakes insteadIngredients:1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour3 tablespoons sugar1 tablespoon baking powder1/4 teaspoon salt1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg2 large eggs, at room temperature1 1/4 cups milk, at room temperature1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as neededNow to make it1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart.

												Vicky 2 is an interesting game.Covering roughly the early/mid 19th century up into the early 20th, this Paradox helping is part Europa Universalis and part Hearts of Iron but mostly something entirely different from anything else the developer has put out there. Just like the actual historical period which it covers, Vicky 2 is more or less all about industrialization and the dramatic changes taking place in the realms of technology, philosophy, politics, and culture across the globe.That being said much of the game's focus is firmly set on the domestic and the player's ability to effectively manage and build upon their chosen country's economy and government - dealing with the challenges laid before them by foreign powers or groups within the nation-state itself.Despite being fairly in line with Paradox's other grand strategy games I just couldn't quite get into this one and I doubt most others will as well.

												I play victoria 2 for a long time. this is a great game, but I bought on ""steam"" extensions ""divided nation"" and ""Heart of darkness"" as noted translated into French, but they are not translated. So until a serious french patch, I am disappointed and disillusioned. And an advice to francophones : Do not buy these unfinished extensions.Je joue a victoria 2 depuis long temps. c'est un super jeu, mais j'ai acheté sur ""steam"" les extensions ""divided nation"" et ""Heart of darkness"" noté comme traduit en francais,  mais ils ne sont pas traduits. donc en attendant un patch francais serieux,  je suis déçu et desabusé.

												I recalled the pleasure of Victoria Revolutions from sometime back. Used to play a lot of LAN games with a friend. Now it is on online, no more LAN for us.So when I buy a game that says it is multiplayer, and I live in the 21st century, I am sorely disappointed when that game requires me to use some third party software to be able to play multiplayer games. I do not care to learn whatever software is needed for a work around just to play a game that should have the functionality.The dated graphics also do the game no favors. Even a 5.00 on sale I feel like I was ripped off on this multiplayer game. A crying shame since there are so few games covering the period.Might be fun solo, but I game to be social with friends who no longer live nearby. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I could see how someone could really enjoy Victoria II. I got about 20 minutes into the tutorial, had covered less than half the material, and my head was spinning. It seems like ""Total War"" on steriods: you know when you start a game as a big nation and spend your first few turns getting your feet under you, consolidating and getting a feel for what's going on? From what I can tell, that's basically the whole game. Micromanaging everything. It's just too complex, and not my thing. But if you're into super in-depth grand strategy, go for it.

												Fix the ♥♥♥♥ing lag and everything else wrong with this god forbbing game.Problems:Constant crashes, VERY poor multiplayer support, once you take Europe it becomes impossible to control, WAY TOO many rebellions(especially after taking over Europe), too long to startup, too many pop ups(already tried turning off all pop ups), and stiff controls.Everytime someone game crashes then everyone else has to restart their game(hamachi). It's ridiculous. With the rebellions, it's just a constant nuisance.Everytime one rebellion is done, then another comes. When that one is over, the same rebellion you defeated BEFORE comes back. It's like they never got defeat/killed.Soultion:The crashing and better multiplayer support would be very nice. As well as make the game more controllable and smoother. This would have been better than HOI3.			",89,6,0,6,3,0,4

												Paradox is no longer a company worth supporting. Their forums are hateful, fan boys crush all criticism, and the moderators ban you for arguing with the professional fan boys (1000s of posts towards people who ask for bug fixes). The games are built around dlc, and they have said they always have about two years worth of dlc planned out. They just dont care about a quality product and call their bug fix patches ""free dlc"".

												Why 'Victoria Revolutions' is better than 'Victoria 2'?I played the USA and there wasn't a US-Mexican War and the Civil War started in 1852. Not against the Confederate States of America - mind you - but against a fantasy faction called 'Free State of America' located around the Great Lakes Region (Detroit).WTF? Why do the developers have the audacity to call this game 'Victoria 2'? They should have called it 'Stellaris 2' because it is set in a different (fantasy) universe - what history is concerned!After this disaster - before I would uninstall the whole bundle - I gave 'Victoria Revolutions' a shot: The US-Mexican War caught me by surprise and unprepared, so I lost it and lost all my prestige! - Why is this a good thing, you may ask? Because it not only taught me to become a better player of this particular game, it also taught me something about history. Because after I failed, I did some research about the US-Mexican War (the causes, how it was conducted, etc.) ... which made me a more educated person!Paradox Games - if you read this: Yes - improve the UI and the graphics, that is all very nice and laudable. But - please - don't destroy the game by robbing it from historical accuracies!!! I know, you wanted to give the players more freedom but does the players really want so much freedom which only leads to a bunch of silliness?Please, please, please - next time make a game which is more historical accurate - not less!!! After all - restrictions are a good thing! ",42,4,5,4,8,0,8

												DO you love the fast-paced world of financing? Then you're in for a treat! Post-Industrialism Budget Simulator II (aka Victoria II) Is a wonderful game where managing your expenditure becomes a breath-taking virtual experience. Pick any country you want and determine their tax system; give your capitalists a free ride with the comprehensive tax system, while your bleed your proletarians dry. Struggle to maintain the perfect balance between your industrial subsidides, traiffs, and national expenditure. Forget about building an army and taking over Europe as Supreme Armchair dictator, this game will have you too busy frantically avoiding bankruptcy to concern yourself with such matters! Yep, Post-Industrialism Budgent Simulator II is a must have for the aspiring predatory lendor in your family!			",13,2,0,0,3,0,8

												Summer 2013 - I bought this game and didn't really know what to think of it as I couldn't largely get into it, possibly due to not understanding how the game works politically and with regards to industrialisation, nevertheless while campaigns were going good I won't say I didn't enjoy them. But during this time I was slightly ill and didn't really feel like learning anything new because my brain just couldn't handle it,Now go to 2014! I've spent hours upon this game and will probably spending more after taking a bit of a break from campaigns, I absolutely adore this game and how in-depth it actually is, without becoming too cumbersome, a sort of happy middle-ground between Europa Universalis 3 and Hearts of Iron 3. I would absolutely recommend this title to anyone who has a liking for grand strategy, or perhaps even for someone who is pioneering the genre for the first time.			",255,24,4,23,51,2,61

												Overall though I found the game enjoyable. There were only a few things that I found annoying (which are corrected in newer Paradox games). I played this game as the US and spent a large portion of my time at speed 5. One of the greatest changes between Victoria II and EU4 or CK2 is the ability to hide messages. I don't care that a certain county now has a nitroglycerin or the Copperheads are planning something, there's no reason that a dictator/president would be given that sort of information. Definitely need to know when someone's declared war on me, but otherwise, I find a lot of the popups to be annoying.The amount of rebellions was also extremely annoying. I know I'm playing the US and the CSA is formed, but I spent most of the Civil War fighting the Jacobite (and several other) rebels into submission. Although the Civil War began in ~1858 I didn't finally put the nail in the coffin until 1872.The election part of the game was interesting as it allows the player to manipulate who is going to win the election with no downside fo them. I am certainly still a noob at this game and will probably put in another 20 or so hours to at least learn the game.tl;dr: I enjoyed this game and will carry on playing. Unfortunately, my friends suck and don't like these games, but I continue to recommend them on deaf ears 8/10.  ",95,11,3,14,60,0,33

												This game is a well fleshed out game, and it is both a classic and well-aged game. Grand Strategy will probably never again have this well a game, and especially not with so much diversity of mechanics as well as depth of mechanics. Clearly Europa Universalis IV shows that. This game is for the true appreciators of history, and as such is not an easily stomached game. Once learned, it is one of the greatest, however.			",178,38,2,29,53,3,48

												Begining in the early 19th century, the game lets you choose any country that was in the world at that time to play as.  Any country; ranging from The United States to Abu Dabhi or Liberia.  Once in the game, you are only given a map interface and a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of tabs.  Through this map and jumbled mess of tabs you manage your country.  Not fun right?  Wrong, when given almost unlimited oppurtunity in one of the most advanced strategy games ever, a lot of fun can be had.  The game is most fun when you give yourself a goal and work for it.  Want to begin the game and establish the actual boundaries of the United States? you can do that.  Want to form the Soviet Union and its iron curtain even before 1910?  You can do that.  Want to form germany?  You can do that.  Want to make a communist Brazil and establish it as a world power?  You can do that too.  The game is unparralleled in its complexity and earns its ""Grand Strategy"" title.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a hidden gem of paradox. It is much harder to get into than Europa Universalis or Crusader Kings but when you manage to get the basics on control, you will find yourself days and night playing creating the best country the world has ever seen.However, this game is less about exploration and warfare than it is about politics and the general population.The game lets you play any country in the world and lets you decide what to do. You gain points by research, military power, economic power and the wellfare of your country. At the end of the last year, the country with the highest score, technically wins. But you could always ignore that and make your own goals.			",135,21,3,28,19,0,35

												I love being able to play a game focused on world events 100 years prior to WW2, it lets you get great insight into how the World wars came about and how a lot of the foundations for other countries around the world came to be. Even though the game isn't 100% historically correct, it still tries to implement a lot of the big events that happened in the world between 1836 - 1936. You can take control of any country you want, be it an already Great Power, or perhaps a secondary power that wishes to achieve Great Power status or even a lesser developed country from the more remote parts of the world, which can perhaps even achieve Great Power status. The game is very varied, the great powers are always going to be more predominent in the worlds affairs but even great powers can fall to their knees sometimes. The micro-management of everthing from factories, to the economy, to the politics, influencing other countries, as well as focusing on military production, is very in-depth and has a steep learning curve, but once mastered, can make the game so much more enjoyable. I really recommened buying the 2 dlc expansions for Victoria II, they add so much to everything in the game, and they iron out heaps of bugs. The Heart of Darkness expansion is particulary good, it adds the ""Crisis Mode"" to the game, which just adds a whole new level of diplomatic and militaristic events to the game. Overall, the game is great, and there is plenty of replayability to the game as you will always be wanting to go back and perhaps try a slightly different tactic to change the future of the world! I give it a 9/10, the game can get quite memory/hard drive intensive as the game goes on and world powers suddenly have massive militaries to command.

												Victoria 2 is the best grand strategy game out there. The POP system is awesome, simulating EVERY adult male in the world, and the era it simulates is one of the most turbulent of mankind. The age that shattered the balance of power brought by the end of the napoleonic wars. What's not to love? Well...The world market sometimes get wonky, but it is rare for it to break, unless you are playing without expansions ( you shouldn't), and if you don't go communist, the last 25-35 years will be pure rebel smashing depending on your nation.But with both expansions, it's a gem, and a must buy. It's perfect? By no means. That would be Victoria 3.IF WE HAD IT, GODDAMMIT PARADOX			",58,10,3,10,33,1,29

												Second only to Hearts of Iron, wth EUIII running a close third. Put the three together and you've got your strategy fix for all ages (add Crusader Kings or CKII to really ramp it up).I am not sure if anyone has added the same sort of save game compatibility as the original EUII, Victoria and HOI2 had (where once you had got to the end of one game, you could load it in the next)  but I believe they are working on that. Can't wait to lead my very early formed Great Britain in EU3 into the Victorian age!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Having played some other titles by the dev before, I wanted ot start with someplace small and out of the way just to get a handle on the mechanics, you know. Anyway, after an enjoyable 3 day learning curve, I initiated land reforms and encouraged immigration. This seems to have caused a civic upswell that resulted in terminal diarreha for half of my population due to a high flow of sewage/pollution without any infrastructure to handle the increases. This unfortunately caused my coffee harvest to fall short because no one could help with the harvest because they coudn't stop pooping... economic depression was all that remained for the survivors of ""the brown tide"". Not too long after this, Columbia invaded me to teach America a lesson (I had agreed to help in a war because I was really far away and figured it was a nice gesture to an old ally). Anyway, after they slaughtered my tribesmen with modern, western weapons, I sued for peace and started to rebuild from scratch. To achieve economic austerity suitable to this phase; I cut all funding to the clergy and education services (my army expenditures already being rather diminished, after all). This helped to keep my people subdued and ignorant while I worked to manually pump industries back up - then I realised that near-40 years had passed in game and I was half as well off as when I started - and unarmed. I vowed never to make land reforms a priority for my governments so soon in primitive locations going forward. Rebooted and started playing the same country again. This time I have invested in experimental railroads instead of land reforms first off... this way there will be a way to quickly remove excesses of waste and bodies in the future incase I f*** up again. 9/10 would recommed accidental poop plague game fail			",17,2,1,4,10,0,8

												Much like Hearts of Iron III, this game is exceptionally complex (I've owned it for 2 years and am still finding new things out) and some fiddling around with verifying the game cache and whatnot before it can work seems almost a universal experience. HOWEVER, there are plenty of places where you can learn the ropes of this game and once you do it will prodive a functionally inexaustable source of entertainment. Keen historians like me will frown at the appearance of WW1 French General Ferdinand Foch in 1840, or the fact that the UK seems hardwired to have 80 years of consecutive Conservative governments without player intervention (what is the Victorian era without Gladstone?), or the bizarre insistance of the Portugese to race like hellfire to conquer the Zulus and Zanzibar makes recreating the British Empire highly awkward, but these are tiny nitpicks. March west as the United States, smash France and form Germany as Prussia, break Prussia's back as France, lead the scattered German states as Austria, fly the Union flag across every continent as the British and loom menacingly over Europe, the Middle-East and Asia as the Russian Bear. Buy this game, and enjoy!			",1,1,0,1,1,0,9

If you want to pick a 100 year period with the most ""The world has gone mad"" moments, this might be it.Now on to the game.Is it fun? Yes, I think so!Is it historically accurate? Well, it depends. It replicates some historical events well enough, but the why of it is completely off (for example, prussia needs a franco-prussian war to form germany in this game, but that's because they need alsace lorraine)What's the most impressive thing about the game? The economic/pop model. I wouldn't call it realistic, but it's so complete. Everything comes from somewhere and goes somewhere!Would I recommend it? Yes because it's fun!			",21,6,0,10,5,0,9

												            Victoria 2 is a fantastic game and I've spent way too much time on this game; that's what Victoria is all about. My main complaint with the game at first was the how unwieldy it was to learn the basic concepts like industry, however it was fixed with many, many hours of testing. My second complaint is that by around 1880 on there isn't much to do other than blindly conquer other nations. My final complaint is that colonizing in the Heart of Darkness expansion sometimes lies about how close my naval bases are.The Best part about this game is the sweet feeling you get when your counties military demolishes france's military. 10/10			",33,7,0,9,7,0,9

												This game can be to most people the greater of complicated games they've come into reach with. However if one pays enough time into this game it will turn into one's favorite Victorian Age simulator of both war and ideologies. Overall this game has turned from one of my unfavorable games into one of my favorites. It is truly complicated but overall there is no other game to par in comparison in quality when showing the tumultous Victorian Age.			",18,1,0,10,7,0,8

												I love being able to play a game focused on world events 100 years prior to WW2, it lets you get great insight into how the World wars came about and how a lot of the foundations for other countries around the world came to be. Even though the game isn't 100% historically correct, it still tries to implement a lot of the big events that happened in the world between 1836 - 1936. You can take control of any country you want, be it an already Great Power, or perhaps a secondary power that wishes to achieve Great Power status or even a lesser developed country from the more remote parts of the world, which can perhaps even achieve Great Power status. The game is very varied, the great powers are always going to be more predominent in the worlds affairs but even great powers can fall to their knees sometimes. The micro-management of everthing from factories, to the economy, to the politics, influencing other countries, as well as focusing on military production, is very in-depth and has a steep learning curve, but once mastered, can make the game so much more enjoyable. I really recommened buying the 2 dlc expansions for Victoria II, they add so much to everything in the game, and they iron out heaps of bugs. The Heart of Darkness expansion is particulary good, it adds the ""Crisis Mode"" to the game, which just adds a whole new level of diplomatic and militaristic events to the game. Overall, the game is great, and there is plenty of replayability to the game as you will always be wanting to go back and perhaps try a slightly different tactic to change the future of the world! I give it a 9/10, the game can get quite memory/hard drive intensive as the game goes on and world powers suddenly have massive militaries to command. I recommend 8gb of ram for this game and if you have an ssd, even better!			",77,6,2,9,4,1,25

												Best Paradox game, ever!The game plays in the context of country management in the 100 yeear period between 1836 and 1936 and it is simply a jewel. It offers a surprising ammount of things to do, and it has a depth that even other Paradox games lack. It is not gamey, and probably the cosest Paradox game to simulating reality as it was. The graphics are a bit dated, but that is by no means a hit on what is a jewel of a game. Buy it, arm yourself with a bit of patience (the game is quite complex) and prepare to enjoy!

												Between 1836 and 1936 in real world we see:Industrialization and the resulting change in social structure;The great war and the resulting changes in world map;Rise of all kinds of ideologies, from communism to fascism;Rise of the USA;Unification of Germany and Italy;Scramble for Africa;and so on. If you want to pick a 100 year period with the most ""The world has gone mad"" moments, this might be it.Now on to the game.Is it fun? Yes, I think so!Is it historically accurate? Well, it depends. It replicates some historical events well enough, but the why of it is completely off (for example, prussia needs a franco-prussian war to form germany in this game, but that's because they need alsace lorraine)What's the most impressive thing about the game? The economic/pop model. I wouldn't call it realistic, but it's so complete. Everything comes from somewhere and goes somewhere!Would I recommend it? Yes because it's fun!			",21,6,0,10,5,0,9

												NOTE; I play a lot in offline mode so my hours may not properly relfect how time I have spent playing this gameVictoria II is an alternate history strategy game taking place from 1836 to 1936, covering a century of some of the most drastic change in human history. It has deep politcal and diplomatic systems, but its economic system is the most relalistic I have ever seen in a strategy game. This game is not going to please everyone, but for those willing to master the difficulty curve will find an incredibly fun Expirence.]Graphics and SoundThe graphics are pretty average for when this game came out. (2010) They are not beautiful but they clearly convey what is going on. The map clearly shows all sorts of information, depending on what veiw you are in, and the simplicity of the graphics allows you to grasp what is going on at a glance.The music is entirly subjective. If you enjoy grand classical music, you will probably love the sound track. Even though I am not a huge fan of classical music, I found myself huming along. However ,if you hate this kind of music, you may just want to play something else. The music will however will be enjoyable to most. It fits the the theme of the game very well and definalty adds to the gameplay, especially when you the music changes when you are at war. Sound effects are average for the genre.GameplayThis game is similar to other Paradox strategy games such as Crusader Kings and Europa Universallis, with a number of big changes.This game has one of the best economic simulations that has ever appeared in a strategy game. It very accurately simulates rises and falls in prices of consumer goods, raw materials and militiary goods., and how they effect everyday people. It very well ties this into the rest of the gameplay, with your industries, farms factories, tax income, citizen's happiness and even your army depending on how well you manage your economy. This of course leads to wide variety of different strategies for managing it, and lots of realistic gameplay. However, it has a steep learning curve, and it can be a struggle for new players to figure it out.The political system is also interesting as it requires the player to balence the need to have a specific party in power to acomplish his goals, and the fact that has the people become more conscience to the world around them, they vote more often for the party they believe in. THis can hinder reforms or industrial growth. Elections are an interesting to guide your citizens toward certain parties and ideas. You can even become a communist, fashist or anarchist government if they get elected, or rebel and take over your captial.One of the most interesting features of diplomacy is the sphereing system. It leads to competition over the third world which can get pretty hetic. The crises and sphereing systems can convince superpowers to act on a smaller countires behalf which makes this the most interesting Paradox grand strategy game to play as a small country.Military is probably the weakest part of Victoria II. You can research a number of different technologies several different units to give you an edge. However, massive conquests are few and far between. It is much more difficult than EUIV or CKII to capture and keep territory. The AI is fairly good at diplomacy, but has horrible strategy during wars. They tend to break their armies into tiny units and pursue hit and run attacks. The most important thing to remember is that in Victoria your army and conquests are there to fuel your industry and economy, unlike a lot of stradegy game which are the other way round. The point is that miliary is not the biggest focus although it is still an important one.Finally if you are are really agresive and repidly take over territory you will quickly be routed by the world powers. You have been warned.Some Other things to mentionI highly recomend getting the two expansion packs, Heart of Darkness and A House Divided. They improve the gameplay quite a lot, improving colonization, war and palying as the U.S, among other things. The other DLC can improve your play expirence depending on how hisorically acurate/detailed you want your game. They do not change the actual gameplay so pick them up if you really enjoyed the game and they are on saleIMPORTANT This game is hard. If you are new to high strategy games. I recomend you try Europa Universallis first, simply becuase it has a better UI and much simpler systems.]ConclusionThis is one of the best strategy games availible on steam right now. It is wonderfully complex and those who enjoy learing how the game works or who simply want to expirience an alternate history of the Victorain era should pick this up.Rating9/10 ",10,5,1,2,28,0,14

												Obviously based on my time spent with this game I enjoyed playing it, but there's too many flaws for me to recommend this at full price.Let's start with diplomacy. It sucks. The AI will constantly abandon you in wars unless they're inside your sphere of influence regardless of their opinion of you or your enemy. In addition, the diplomatic feedback is incredibly non-specific and results are entirely percentile based instead of a system that weighs the positive and negative factors to produce a yes or no answer. This is frustrating when the player is trying to form an alliance to survive as a weaker country. Does the Ottoman Empire want to keep Spanish and French influence outside of North Africa? Maybe. I can understand the theory behind this (after all, what government knows exactly what other governments are thinking?) but in practice it leads to silly things like an alliance being accepted three months later with LOWER diplomatic relations than the previous offer. I do like political spheres as a game mechanic, but it seems odd that a 'friendly' nation with 200 relations would reject alliance offers or military access requests.Warfare in Victoria 2 is handled fairly well, but it's difficult to tell at a glance what an enemies army tech level is until after you're already in combat. I don't really have any comments to make about it other than that it works and is decently fun to do. Economic management in any system that uses capitalists to build factories is incredibly annoying. In an age of planes, trains, and automobiles, an aspiring businessman will instead invest in a sailboat factory. Encouraging certain industries can help avoid this but it is by no means a total solution and doesn't actually prevent ♥♥♥♥♥♥ factories from being built. The projected income is virtually worthless as the amount never matches actual income and also doesn't include overseas upkeep costs. The government and social reforms work for the most part, except for in systems that allow full citizenship of all ethnicities. I conquered part of China with a liberal government, and because of the demographic change a conservative government was elected largely in part due to the Chinese vote. The new government prevented Chinese citizens from voting and they got upset about losing the right to vote. ALL OF MY WAT. The rebel system is far too vague about when rebels will actually spawn and supression points are worthless. The AI is terrible at managing countries. Small armies of 1-3 stacks will suicide into groups of 200 stacks for no apparent reason and uncivilized countries will sometimes have an absurd number of beuarucrats and manage their populations needs so poorly a province can drop to 1 citizen. Countries that never enter a single war will go bankrupt multiple times. They'll fight over sphering a tiny country while ignoring larger, more valuable targets. Overall, Victoria 2 can be very fun but it lacks in some of its most important features which forces you to use workarounds. If that doesn't bother you go ahead and make a purchase, but don't pay full price for this game if you're not already a fan of the genre. Victoria 2 relies heavily on management of your economy and alliances to do well. The problem is many of these factors are simply out of the player's influence unless you use console commands to cheat. Vanilla Victoria 2 is not very good and each DLC makes the game much better, but locks the fun behind a paywall. TL;DR: Buy the collection if it's on sale, otherwise hold off until it does.

It has it's weaknesses (trade seems a bit arbitrary), and I hear you want the main DLC to make it as good as it can be (I bought the complete package).

												Don't let the playtime fool you. I pirated this a long time ago (yeah, I know it's bad, but I eventually purchased it obviously), but i've played roughly over 300 hrs in this masterpiece. This game goes extremely in depth with Economy and Diplomacy being the focus points. One can definitely get lost in all the sliders and diplomacy (still trying to get England to like me as #1 in the world)... but after a while you get a lot of what the game is trying to accomplish, and that is when your country will flourish. Diplomacy:This game uses a ""sphere"" system in which if you get a country into your sphere, you become the primary target in terms of trade (basically, you get all of the trade the country offers for a relatively cheap price). The game also uses a ""Crisis"" system in which when a Crisis Temperature in a region hits 100.. it's all out war with the belligerants that consist mostly of GP (Great Powers).Speaking of GP... having a lot of GP's in your alliance as a weak nation is perfect (if you don't allow yourself to get sphered too quickly... i'm looking at you France). If you are a great power yourself, at the start of the game you're allowed only one GP, and if you're Prussia, you're basically screwed since France usually allies with Russia, and GB is willing to work with you at the beginning, then abandon you when you get too powerful... and then look to always declare war on you. Coming to think of it... resembles a lot like RL GB. All nations have a ""Point System"" that is divided into 3 values: ""Military Power"", ""Prestige"", and ""Industrial Power"".Military Power: Points that dictate how much power your military has (takes into account technology, and number of Units/ and mobilized units)Prestige: How well your country has done since the start of your campaign (Note: If you have a high Prestige, countries are willing to do deals with you much easier, and automatically generates ""Sphere Points"" to all countries. Industrial Power: This is the most important part that will likely be the reason why you're rich, or why you're poor. The more Industry, the more money you can make from producing goods, and selling them.Also, for Diplomacy... if you've ever played EU4 before this, then you are likely reminded of the ""AE"". Same applies here, but instead called Infamy. Infamy here however, will affect whether or not your allies will stay your allies... bare in mind when you go on a conquering spree xD. If you conquer too much too fast... you'll likely find yourself in a ""Containment War"" which basically means all the GP's that are not your allies will come crashing down on you (doesn't matter if you're focusing on the other regions of the world, so bare that in mind too).Economy: If you were paying attention to your industry and pop (population) early in the game, you will almost always succeed in this. If you didn't go moblizing and losing all of your male populations, then there will always be men in factories (notice, when you mobilize, it's taking men out of the factories to fight in your war... so once the war is over, immediatly demobilize to get the survivors back to work). My strategy every game is to take provinces from China very early in the game. That provides additional pop's, and if theres no work in China... your pop there will move to your mainland, which will fill up those factories really quick. Then you get a whole bunch of tax revenue aswell as extra men to fight in your wars. There's a whole bunch of stuff I didn't include because I already burned my life into both this game, and EU4... theres more detailed stuff out there, but I hoped I convinced anyone reading this to purchase this game. Happy Blobbing!			",46,11,1,5,23,1,14

												A great thing about this game is that it's never the same game twice. You can have a game where france invades britain in the 1840s or where germany never forms because austria has taken half of it. Maybe japan never becomes a great power or the U.S. becomes communist. You just never know with this game. And I love it! It gives it endless replay value and unlike most grand strategy games i've played, there's still a lot going on even when you're not at war! It's not for everyone though, and it can be frustrating to learn, but once you know what you're doing, it's hard to find a better game like it. pros: +Endless replay value+Not boring in peacetime+Complex but not convoluted+Easy to run+In-DepthCons:-AI can be really stupid at times-Steep learning curve-Bad tutorial9/10			",44,3,0,3,13,0,17

												Getting this game on a steam sale was an amazing Idea and I have no regrets. I think I got the full game with all relevant expansions for about $10. Regularly the game costs $20 , but the value easily dwarfs the $20 price tag. Although if you get this game yuoreally do need to get the expansions as well; so if there's a pack get it. Paradox games have filled a place in my heart of games. They're fun, informative and even replayable; Victoria 2 is no different and I'm happy of it. The game can be complicated at first, but after diving into a game head first and exploring the controls you can learn extremely quickly and even if you can't learn that way easily, just go to youtube and watch some tutorials. Pros:+Amazing Replayablility+Great UI +Challenging+Informative(Both in the game and historical events)+Dynamic(every game is different)+Low toll on the computer+Good mods+Cool population system(immagration and population growth)+Colonization gameCons:-Pretty much need the expansion packs, especially for mods-Some forms of government are extremely underpowered(communist becomes extremely hard to manage later in the game)-Occasional lodaup bugs and mod loadings; you may need to tinker to find the solution.-Shorter than Europa's base-timeline length.(mods can fix this)-Fairly high priced(with expansions, which I highly recommend to buy with the game). -limited start dates(mods can fix it, but still. Only one) I probably missed stuff, but this game is extremely addicting when you get into a game. I really recommend it for any strategy gamer and especially a paradox gamer.  ",73,2,0,14,23,0,46

												This is not an easy or easily-accessible game.  A lot of the game mechanics are not explained in the tutorials and the interface is very dry and sometimes a bit deep and complicated.  This is the Dwarf Fortress of strategy games, with no actual victory conditions and a cliff-like learning curve.  All that said, when you do master it, you'll be sucked in like you wouldn't believe.  If Europa Universalis is too tame and simple, then this is your game.			",93,12,0,2,12,0,10

												I bought this game on the steam christmas sale. I have a bit to say about it both good and bad*I only have the vanilla game, I have yet to grab the DLC*Grand Strategy Games:This is a genre that focuses a lot on complex and/or large strategy games that mostly involve a political simulator. Victoria 2 is a grand strategy that puts you in the shoes of the leader of any country from 1836 to 1936, the cusp of the second world war. This was known as the industial era for many countries and was also the time the British Empire had reached the hight of it's power. The Grand Campain:This is the main game. You start in 1831 and you can select any country that was around during that period. From there, you will make many decisions. Each country plays differently usually because of location, what state the country is in and the different government and ruling party types. Of course, some countries are stronger than others, so there is a ranking system for the world. Great Powers are the top 8 countries. Theen the secondary powers. Followed by civilized nations and uncivilized nations. Parts of the world are also still uncolinized like parts of Canada and most of Africa. Some countries like Germany, Italy and Norway as well as many more countries have still not been formed or are yet to gain independece from larger empires like the British.Pros--Large list of countries to play as.-Real events such as the American Civil War.-A good UI that conveys all the information needed about your country.- Can colonize to expand your lands (Only Great Powers and Secondary Powers may colonize)-Choices define what makes your empire. They are important. Most choices have advantages and disadvantages to choose your choices wisely.-Can have rebellions in your country if peopleget too militant.-Play at your own pace. Fast forwarding and pausing the game at any time.-Lots of techs to research and inventions to discover, giving you different kinds of advantages.-A decent tutorial to get you going.Cons--A very steep learning curve if you are new to these kind of games.(Does have a decent tutorial though)-AI has a few problems sometimes, could have been fixed with DLC though.- Bad multiplayer, it's hard to join other people and you can't just quick join random people. To join someone, you must register on the Paradox fourms or use a virtual network like Hamachi.-Hard to keep track of world events. You can set certain catagory events to pop up if you like but a lot of events wont pop up by deafault, they just happen.Can't think of what else to say about the game other than it's fun to see where you can go by just choosing some interesting countries and trying to develope them into whatever you want. For example, I played as britain and released Ireland from the british empire and then decided to play as Ireland since I am Irish ha. I began to tax people severly to improve my econemy and so I began buying weapon parts. I began to build transport ships and recruit and army and then I invaded Malaysia. Tried to invade surrounding nations but the world quickly turned on me. America, Russia, Britain, France all declared war on me and they quicky arrived on Irish soil. The purpose of the war was to contain me and I agreed within a couple of months and so I lost a huge portion of my army. Oh well... I got Ireland pretty far in terms of inustry in the end with a booming economy as well. I got from rank 55 to 30 in the end but oh well. Now, I am ploting my revenge and my plan for world domination xDVerdict, 8/10. Pretty damn good, but has a few problems.*Again, note that I have none of the DLC for this game. The game might easily be a 9/10 with a couple of it's problems fixed*			",37,5,0,4,19,0,20

												Conclusion: While having had a nation in tears, it's the most fun Paradox game I played.So I started as the Netherlands, full of some good expansionist spirit, and began my conquests in Asia but had no idea about infamy amongst nations or why protectorates are better than conquests.. so just into my second expansion, I got cut to size ('contain') by England forcing me to half my armies,pay 33% tax in repairs and raise no new armies. Guess what happened next.. standing there all naked...mother Russia came knocking for the same: A nation in tears.So I did what any other 19th century ruler would have done.. go online... watch some let's play youtubes, learn about factories, profits and how to get in the top 8 of nations (fun).. and that a low tax rate for the wealthy truly is an inspiring solution..  So right now I've got Holland at no.7 nipping at the heals of Austria in pos 6  in 1849 (to be continued) and I'm having a ball to get the 'free' elections to play out right :)Summary- For me, the most enjoyable Grand Strategy game from Paradox  (above HOI2/DH,CK2,HOI3 and EUx) especially because I don't need to micro manage everything.- Great interface, after the initial learning the concepts hurdle- Decent Graphics with great overlays- Great Music as it does not wear out- You'll pick up entirely new insights into economics & politics- Fun!!! & Challenging- Every game turns out very differentScore for Victoria2 Heart of Darkness:9.5/10 (-0.5 because it needs two expansion packs: please just sell it as Vic2 Complete)			",80,5,10,5,37,0,20

The graphics are good enough to convey what needs to be said without bogging down the system. I have only begun to play but it seems fairly challenging already. Should be fun to explore the different nations particulat situations in this time frame by having to make their choices for them. This was an amazing time in history.			",5,0,0,1,1,0,7

												It's hard to 'recommend' this title, as any deviants like myself who should know it, or find its type of game interesting, are already familliar. For those, however, who have never yet had the pleasure of staring at a map for hours on end, in anticipation of one blob changing from red, to blue, this is defiantly, by which I mean 'in my modest', our Swedish' friends second most complex brand, and therefore is even more like  than the rest to scare you away.Unless of course, you feel the pressing need to indulge your Industrial Era Imperator, new person, I'd recommend for you to lunge for Europa Universalis, or Crusader Kings, act 2.

												I love this game so much. And yet at the same time I hate it with intense passion. It's amazing - the way it breaks you. I started playing it thinking it would be a fun romp through the Nineteenth century, conquering and colonizing every bloody ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who looked at me the wrong way. Yeah, right. In that sense it reminds me of Silent Hunter III - the only game that, I'll admit, beat me. This game put me into my place, slapped me around, and said: ""Right, now THIS is how you're going to play."" And I did, Expect to read a lot of guides because starting Victoria II requires preparation. And when you know how it works, well... Then you can start innovating, trying out new daring strategies.The most important thing I found out was that, though it may seem a small victory on a grand scale, it's still as important as any other. Alliances are always shifting: one decade I (as Belgium) was buddy-buddies with France fight a Dutch-Prussian coalition, the next - Germany helps to repel French invaders from my soil. The great nations themselves might suffer crippling bankruptcies rearranging the power system.It's a very hard, very fun and VERY rewarding game when you get down to it. I never thought I would be able to play it much less enjoy it. Victoria II does require determination, and study if you're not familiar with the grand strategy genre, as I was, but in the end it's worth it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Quite possible one of the greatest strategy games ever created. The control the player has over economics and politics is unmatched and fantastic, and the military module is quite good too. You can play as a juggernaut state from the West and carve out a giant world straddlingempire, or you can strike it ou tas a developing nation. Paradox has managed to make all of these scenarios almost equally fun. The game is quite modable, and there are huge packs that put the game in the modern world, or extend its timeline over 300 years. This game is far different from Europa Universalis or Hearts of Iron, but is different in a good way. If you are looking for more than just a military simulator or world map color changer, this game is for you.			",114,9,2,14,48,1,35

The replayablity is brilliant with the choice of tons of countries (mods add more) to play as and form. The actual gameplay is highly realistic (but not too much to be slow and boring) and allows you to exploit native peoples arround the world, what more does any self respecting European statesman want?

												Victoria 2 is a great historically accurate grand strategy game. I found that it was great in the focus on the Scramble for Africa and the American Civil War. One issue I found with it was it was hard to play as any other nation other than the main colonial powers. Most other games produced by Paradox Interactive allow you to buff your forces to take on your similar strength neighbours, however in Victoria II I feel that it restricts gameplay to only the colonial powers.Overall, I would reccomend this game to anyone who wants to try out a grand strategy game for the first time due to a lesser learning curve then games like Hearts of Iron III and Europa Universalis 4.

												This game can be to most people the greater of complicated games they've come into reach with. However if one pays enough time into this game it will turn into one's favorite Victorian Age simulator of both war and ideologies. Overall this game has turned from one of my unfavorable games into one of my favorites. It is truly complicated but overall there is no other game to par in comparison in quality when showing the tumultous Victorian Age.			",18,1,0,10,7,0,8

												I love this game so much. It's a life changing game. Before I couldn't tell you a thing about the Industrial Revolution or the geography of the period. Before this game I had no interest in the period, little interest in history period. Then this game comes along and fundamentally changes my interests.This game is very difficult to learn, but once you figure it out it is a game you can put a couple hundred hours into easily. It's probably one of my favorite games of all time			",96,20,0,26,16,0,35

												Hoo boy does this game have a steep learning curve. And the Victorian era doesn't exactly excite people the way the middle ages or ancient Rome does. But if you work past that, you will have a fascinatingly exploration of an era that still defines our modern life, only now you get to set the course. Will America become a communist nation? Will France, after losing the Great War become fascist? Who will lead the world in automobile production? Have Brazil lead the scramble for Africa. Have Egypt form a pan-national Arab empire. Dismantle the British Empire. Make Canada the 51st state.The only limit is your imagination (and RGO's).			",131,73,1,27,22,3,20

												Victoria II is a very linear game that takes you though the key events of the mid-1800s to the mid-1900s, such as:- The American Civil War- The Meiji Restoration of Japan- The rise and reign of terror of the Fascist Orange Free State- The Great War, including a monumental simulation of the famous ""California Campaign"" by the Communist forces of the Cherokee Nation- The Great Depression of 1907, where the sudden drop of the price of glass destroyed the world economy beyond repair- That time when the Chinese Empire westernized and proceeded to completely slaughter the combined armies of France, the Netherlands, and HungaryHighly recommended for those of us who pine for a ""history"" game that is truly historical.

												Victoria II is a very niche game in my opinion. This is not for everyone. The combat is basically a combination of luck and stats and is very frustrating so don't come into this game expecting anything like StarCraft.As an avid lover of history though this is basically my wet dream come true. Victoria II focuses on the Post Napoleon Era of the world. This game allows you to play as basically everything country that existed between the early 19th century and the 1920s. I have never seen a game that allowed me to play as Belgium or Colombia or Hawaii. The point is to take your country from an early industrial state to being an imperial empire.You have to build your nation, your economy, your foreign relations, and your military. Either hope to be one of the eight main superpowers or pray to at least maintain your independence. What it most interesting is that there doesn't seem to be a way to actually ""lose"". When my government was overthrown I thought I lost, but the game kept going. Except we were communists and new social policies were in place and my ecomony was wrecked from the civil war. Which is interesting mechanic. The objective is to be the top great power and you are competing with over a 100 other nations that may come and go. Mods add even more.Victoria II works for me because I like the management aspect and it focuses on my favorite era of history and allows me to play anywhere in the world. I have to plan my economy and expansion and go to war carefully since it can cost you prestige, cost you a portion of your workforce if they get slaughtered, and drain your economy (like a real nation).It's not a perfect game, but I have fun and maybe you will too.

												Paradox Studios grand strategy games span the history of the world in a more-or-less continuous order; at time of writing, I consider the main series to be...Crusader Kings II (769 - 1453)Europa Universalis IV (1444 - 1821)Victoria II (1836 - 1936)Hearts of Iron III (1936 - 1948)So Victoria II sits near the end of that progression, covering the fall of the Ottoman Empire, the American Civil War, the growth of Japan (and industrialisation in general), and notably, the First World War (if it happens!). It's a period where huge political shifts occur in the power structure of the world, the first major colonisation pushes are made, and eventually, the scramble for Africa. You can take control of LITERALLY any country and pilot them through this period, building railroads, factories, battleships, and influencing policies, political parties, and social movements. You can grow your country into one of the Great Powers of the world, and establish protectorates, bring other countries into your sphere of influence, and found colonies.This one game, with its incredible scope, is really many different games in one; playing America (initially a slave state) will be a largely different experience to playing, say, China, which will yet again be different to playing a tiny country like Panama. I've had most fun playing the 'middle' states, like Persia, Japan, and Australia (after devolving it from the British Empire). While it's hard to rock the boat at the top of the great powers list, I've also had fun playing France, making major in-roads into the nascent Germany, and conquering Switzerland. Alliances can bring about amusing consequences (like, in my France game, Equadorian Sardinia??), and national decisions can create large diversions from history.All this aside, bear in mind this is a Paradox strategy game. Which means, if you haven't played one before, be prepared for a LONG game, with potentially a lot of waiting. Colonisation, a really key part of the game for great powers, isn't possible until over 20 hours in, at least. The menus are many, and the choices opaque. I highly recommend watching a Let's Play for this game before you attempt it. Once you've learnt to play it, however, it's a very rewarding experience.It's not for everyone, but if you like long, deep Grand Strategy games, give a try.			",118,40,0,23,29,4,40

												Hard to get into so I would recomend a video and a walk through with a nation like Brazil or America that is pretty powerful and isolated from other great powers. Japan is great if you want to get into a uncivilized nation. I am trying out a play through as China now. Once you get into it is is so rewarding and the depth makes games like civ feel like mega blocks by comparison. Oh and I would recomend getting House Divided and Heart of Darkness and more dlc if you want to add new units and a custom national feel. 10 out of 10. My first experience with a Paradox game. Friend me if you want to play me in multiplayer and so I can help you get into this amazing game.			",14,3,0,8,31,0,23

												A classic Paradox game, Victoria 2 is a grand strategy set during the Industrial Revolution up until 1936, where Hearts of Iron picks up. It is a very complex game and requires multiple play throughs. This is a game that will be difficult to start up and it's one of those games that frequent vists to the forums are probably going to help. The dlc in this game is certainly worth buying since it significantly imporves the quality of gameplay by adding crises and well worked colonization system. Overall this game is a HUGE timesink and it will be making you sit for hours on end, wanting to play more the next day.8/10			",111,5,3,5,31,0,41

												Spended some time playing this game, time to say some words. I really enjoy playing this game and I would recommend this to everyone who likes history, and strategy and big amounts of data an informations. At first it can looks overwhelming such amount of things to take care of in order to make your country running satisfactory well. But, after a while, after getting into how the game works, its fun guaranteed. I had lots of fun sitting back, watching my empire growing and my colonies too, winning battles and remaking history the way I wanted.			",4,2,0,3,6,0,15

												Superb strategy game based in the 19th and early 20th centuries. It has a lot of depth delving into political systems, economics, industry and infrastructure, warfare, and a lot more. While there is a lot of things that this game does right, the only thing I believe that it does wrong is not automating or aiding in management of military units. The AI clearly has an advantage over the player because of how well they're able to manage units. Otherwise, the game is brilliant.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Vic2 is probably my favorite game of all time. The learning curve is steep, but once you've played through a couple of games and browsed the wiki it all comes together. You NEED Heart of Darkness to play, I wouldn't recommend playing the vanilla game. Also, Vic2 and it's expansions go on sale a lot, don't pay full price for them.			",5,0,0,4,7,0,11

												A deep and complex game from the masters of Grand Strategy. The graphics are a bit meh (but it's a GS Game, so that's kinda to be expected) and the, well, it can all get a good bit overwhelming, but I cannot complain much more. It's amazing, but it can be annoying for new players, even with the tutorial. I suggest watching a couple of LP's on Youtube of this before diving in head first.			",41,3,0,6,10,0,40

												With a little time spent to get over the learning curve, this game provides limitless hours of fun for any seasoned armchair general. Paradox has never released a title that hasn't lived up to their standard of deep, quality grand strategy and Vicky 2 is no exception. However, if you are the strategist that prefers massive conquest and expansive wars, Victoria might not be for you, as the focus is much more on politics, economy, and diplomacy. Conquering territory will take time, and a large country may take many years if not decades of war to be completely annexed.			",169,13,0,20,22,0,22

												I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes long games, and strategy. I've had this game for a year and a half (Not on Steam) and I still play it almost everyday, and while it has a steep learning curve (like most paradox games) learining to play the game is highly rewarding. This game is a giant sandbox, it allows you to play any existing nation from 1836-1935, you can even play as other nations as they are created.  While the Vanilla game is great, I would highly recommend getting the 'Victoria 2 Collection' As the 2 DLC really spice up gameplay and improve the game itself. THis game is not one you can beat on a day like I said it has very long games, with various political party's to choose for your nation, and infinite possibilites. All in all this is in my top 5 favorite games, and I highly recommend it, despite the price.			",65,1,0,1,9,0,16

												This game is amazing. It isn't like the other Paradox games where you just blob and do nothing. There are actual things to do that aren't war. You can build your industry, invade lesser advanced countries for resources or population. And the game also has amazing alternate history mods, such as Napoleons Legacy, Divergences of Darkness, Liangmod (when it finishes) and more that are well thought out. I recommend this game.

												When I explain this game to friends, I always call it the Otto von Bismark simulator. I think this is perhaps the best way to sum up the role of the player in this simulation of the period between 1836-1936.In contrast with other titles from Paradox that people may have played, this game has a much lighter focus on war, and a far greater and deeper focus on internal politics and social movements than any other Paradox title. Detailed data on industry, demographics, trade, and government policies are all there to be manipulated for the advancement of the goals of your people, or alternatively, the goals of their ruler. The player truly is the arbiter between a ruler and his people, and decides the political outcome for any state in the whole wide world, by the end of the session. This makes up greatly for the notable fact that this is the shortest of true Paradox ""grand campaign"" games (since I don't consider Hearts of Iron to be one). The fact that only 100 years is playable is far outshone by the amount of activities to partake in as you play them.Now, I should note, for players of newer Paradox titles (as I myself was when I picked up V2), that the war AI is quite inferior to that of the more recent titles (particularly the fantastic EU IV AI), and graphics are also much less immersive. However, in my opinion, the sheer volume of social and political management you have access to during ""downtime"" completely demolishes a sole reliance on good graphics and war gameplay. In fact, if you couple the fact that V2 is a fully developed game that is not undergoing constant mechanical reinvention and the fact that it does not suffer from the great DLC bloat of those newer titles, you, like me, might come to find that Victoria 2 is the greatest Paradox grand strategy title.Highly recommended.

												It's the mother of all empire-builders.If you're at all interested in the period or just want to try your hand at running a country , this is the game for you. Economics, politics, diplomacy, colonization, and war, it's all there. The game does require a learning curve and depending on the country, it can be slow at times.However building your economy from nothing and dominating your rivals is immensely satisfying. Unlike the EU series this isn't a war game, war is always an option but as the century goes on you'll find war increasingly costly unless you beat down your foes at the start.Be sure to get the expansions, especially Heart of Darkness as it adds a lot to colonization and diplomacy. Crises in particular are great, if you're not careful you can drag Europe into total war over some petty imperial squabbles, not unlike how WW1 began in real life.			",32,3,0,4,5,0,10

												This game is great for anyone who likes to think, you need to manage your attention. There are also enough achieveable objectives to satisfy any level of gameplay, from novice through to strategy gaming pro; so you can spend many hours blissfully unaware of your surroundings as you conquer the world. The historical events are also fun as you can play with history (creating Germany in the 1840s slightly changes the Franco-Prussian War). All in all, I would recommend it highly as it has provided me with many hours of enjoyment and some great multiplayer games :)			",31,16,0,10,10,0,10

												Victoria II is an epic strategy game that trancends the 19th century, in to the dawn of the 20th. It is as neither expansive as Europa Universalis III, nor as in-depth as Hearts of Iron III, yet it manages to capture perfectly a time period of industrializatoin and expansion. The combat system is a hybrid of EU3s simplistic 3 unit-type system, and the depth of HoE3. The government and economy seem to be the focus of this game, as your main difficulties are supplying your citizens with their needs while establishing a powerful industrial economy. This can be easy or difficult depending on your nation of choice, as you can choose to play as any nation in existence on January 1, 1836. If I were to give this game a rating out of 10, I would give it an 8.5. I would recommend this game to any hard-core strategy fan who is looking for an in-depth yet accessible game.

												In my opinion, this game is the best way to start playing Paradox grand strategy games. At first, game interface is easier to understand. Importan thing about the game is industrialism, you have to adapt your country, your citizens to consume much and keep them continue their life happy. Research points are also very important, increasing literacy rate of your country has directly effect your developement agaist rival countries(nobody wants to lose war with 100.000 soldiers against 50.000:) After building a strong industry, you need to supply factories mostly from overseas like Far East and Africa. Colonization is also very important issue, after mid game a Great Power country should have some colonies from overseas, Africa is easy to connect from Europe even for American countries. I suggest this game to people who has interest for 19th century history or pre WW's age how most of today's superpowers begin their journey(adapting new policies or form strong nation) to split from rest of the world. A full game will last around 30 hours of gameplay but time will change drastically concerning about your game style.Personally I recommend this game to strategy lovers especially whose want to start playing Paradox Interactive grand strategy games. After then you will get addicted to grand strategy sub genre games like Crusader Kings, Europa Universalis and Hearts of Iron. My point is 8.5/10 to this lovely game:)			",70,7,0,6,10,0,12

												Overall though I found the game enjoyable. There were only a few things that I found annoying (which are corrected in newer Paradox games). I played this game as the US and spent a large portion of my time at speed 5. One of the greatest changes between Victoria II and EU4 or CK2 is the ability to hide messages. I don't care that a certain county now has a nitroglycerin or the Copperheads are planning something, there's no reason that a dictator/president would be given that sort of information. Definitely need to know when someone's declared war on me, but otherwise, I find a lot of the popups to be annoying.The amount of rebellions was also extremely annoying. I know I'm playing the US and the CSA is formed, but I spent most of the Civil War fighting the Jacobite (and several other) rebels into submission. Although the Civil War began in ~1858 I didn't finally put the nail in the coffin until 1872.The election part of the game was interesting as it allows the player to manipulate who is going to win the election with no downside fo them. I am certainly still a noob at this game and will probably put in another 20 or so hours to at least learn the game.tl;dr: I enjoyed this game and will carry on playing. Unfortunately, my friends suck and don't like these games, but I continue to recommend them on deaf ears 8/10.  ",95,11,3,14,60,0,33

												I spent many many hours on Victoria I and II in the past. it is absorbing and so incredibly detailed. While you can automate a lot of functions, if you want to master the game (esp win with the larger countries) then you'll find yourself dealing with hundreds of units and staffing & trade across vast national industries. It is worth it once you get past that sharp learning curve and you pick up a lot of history on the way! By far my favourite strategy game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't let the playtime fool you. I pirated this a long time ago (yeah, I know it's bad, but I eventually purchased it obviously), but i've played roughly over 300 hrs in this masterpiece. This game goes extremely in depth with Economy and Diplomacy being the focus points. One can definitely get lost in all the sliders and diplomacy (still trying to get England to like me as #1 in the world)... but after a while you get a lot of what the game is trying to accomplish, and that is when your country will flourish. Diplomacy:This game uses a ""sphere"" system in which if you get a country into your sphere, you become the primary target in terms of trade (basically, you get all of the trade the country offers for a relatively cheap price). The game also uses a ""Crisis"" system in which when a Crisis Temperature in a region hits 100.. it's all out war with the belligerants that consist mostly of GP (Great Powers).Speaking of GP... having a lot of GP's in your alliance as a weak nation is perfect (if you don't allow yourself to get sphered too quickly... i'm looking at you France). If you are a great power yourself, at the start of the game you're allowed only one GP, and if you're Prussia, you're basically screwed since France usually allies with Russia, and GB is willing to work with you at the beginning, then abandon you when you get too powerful... and then look to always declare war on you. Coming to think of it... resembles a lot like RL GB. All nations have a ""Point System"" that is divided into 3 values: ""Military Power"", ""Prestige"", and ""Industrial Power"".Military Power: Points that dictate how much power your military has (takes into account technology, and number of Units/ and mobilized units)Prestige: How well your country has done since the start of your campaign (Note: If you have a high Prestige, countries are willing to do deals with you much easier, and automatically generates ""Sphere Points"" to all countries. Industrial Power: This is the most important part that will likely be the reason why you're rich, or why you're poor. The more Industry, the more money you can make from producing goods, and selling them.Also, for Diplomacy... if you've ever played EU4 before this, then you are likely reminded of the ""AE"". Same applies here, but instead called Infamy. Infamy here however, will affect whether or not your allies will stay your allies... bare in mind when you go on a conquering spree xD. If you conquer too much too fast... you'll likely find yourself in a ""Containment War"" which basically means all the GP's that are not your allies will come crashing down on you (doesn't matter if you're focusing on the other regions of the world, so bare that in mind too).Economy: If you were paying attention to your industry and pop (population) early in the game, you will almost always succeed in this. If you didn't go moblizing and losing all of your male populations, then there will always be men in factories (notice, when you mobilize, it's taking men out of the factories to fight in your war... so once the war is over, immediatly demobilize to get the survivors back to work). My strategy every game is to take provinces from China very early in the game. That provides additional pop's, and if theres no work in China... your pop there will move to your mainland, which will fill up those factories really quick. Then you get a whole bunch of tax revenue aswell as extra men to fight in your wars. There's a whole bunch of stuff I didn't include because I already burned my life into both this game, and EU4... theres more detailed stuff out there, but I hoped I convinced anyone reading this to purchase this game. Happy Blobbing!			",46,11,1,5,23,1,14

												This review goes for all the Paradox games I've played so far. Victoria II is what I call a National Strategy game (care for your country of choice and Expand.) Crusders II is a Kingdom (more personal involvement and expand), Europe Universialis IV is a County Strategy for room to expand as well. Victoria II is a great game to play, even though I'm havin my butt handed to me I play in Texas So I'm by myself and I always have Mexico annexing Texas. I only have 8 troops to start with. It's easy to get going in The USA part, but by urself it's a different ball game. Anyone who enjoys these types of games Medieval games that is (I'm a medieval junkie) will enjoy Victoria II. Game play is the same as Crusaders II and the rest. You deal with elections, set up factories, build boats, navy and Amry troops. Keep or abolish salvery. by a Demicratic, Whig, or Conservative Party each with there pro's and con's for each party. Again if you like games like this I recommend Victoria II.			",7,1,0,4,3,0,2

												When I explain this game to friends, I always call it the Otto von Bismark simulator. I think this is perhaps the best way to sum up the role of the player in this simulation of the period between 1836-1936.In contrast with other titles from Paradox that people may have played, this game has a much lighter focus on war, and a far greater and deeper focus on internal politics and social movements than any other Paradox title. Detailed data on industry, demographics, trade, and government policies are all there to be manipulated for the advancement of the goals of your people, or alternatively, the goals of their ruler. The player truly is the arbiter between a ruler and his people, and decides the political outcome for any state in the whole wide world, by the end of the session. This makes up greatly for the notable fact that this is the shortest of true Paradox ""grand campaign"" games (since I don't consider Hearts of Iron to be one). The fact that only 100 years is playable is far outshone by the amount of activities to partake in as you play them.Now, I should note, for players of newer Paradox titles (as I myself was when I picked up V2), that the war AI is quite inferior to that of the more recent titles (particularly the fantastic EU IV AI), and graphics are also much less immersive. However, in my opinion, the sheer volume of social and political management you have access to during ""downtime"" completely demolishes a sole reliance on good graphics and war gameplay. In fact, if you couple the fact that V2 is a fully developed game that is not undergoing constant mechanical reinvention and the fact that it does not suffer from the great DLC bloat of those newer titles, you, like me, might come to find that Victoria 2 is the greatest Paradox grand strategy title.Highly recommended.

												THE best strategy game of all time. If you don't like this game you're not a strategy gamer. Victoria 2 gives the player unprecedented control over the political and economic aspects of countries in the Victorian Era. On top of that, there are hundreds of nations to chose from and form, covering all of the nations that existed from 1839-1936. You want to be an expansionist France who longs to integrate the Wallonians and reach it's natural borders west of the Rhine? You can do that.You want to be a German Empire that's the number one country in the world industrially, with unrivaled infrastructure and vast coal reserves? You bet your♥♥♥♥♥you can.You long to unifiy the Indian people and liberate them from the British Tyranny? Go right ahead. You want to help Iran take a different approach during the Victorian Era, and to become one of the world's Great Powers? The only thing stopping you is your imagination. What are you waiting for, buy it!			",107,8,0,10,19,0,26

												Already a classic from the Paradox games. It can take a while to learn and hold full grasp of all the mechanics at the beginning. But the variety of countries to play, and the different paths you can make your country can undergo make it one of the best Grand Strategy games in the market, not only in its complexity and realism but also because it's generally not too.For now my hours in the game are few in Steam, but I already have hundreds of hours of gameplay in the CD-based game I had. Forming new nations, colonizing Africa and America, industrializing, taking territory from you enemies or just liberating countries under them, passing social and liberal reform to become a democracy, or roll back such reform to return to Absolutism, your choice.

												Really detailed and with a wide range of things to do, countries to play as and a generally enjoyable sandbox environment. A worthy purchase for any fan of Paradox's other games like Crusader Kings 2, Hearts of Iron or Europa Universalis. Even at its normal price it's worth it but it's especially good if you (like I did) get the Victoria Collection on sale, making it an absolute steal. There are also a bunch of great mods like HPM and NWO which improve on the game (e.g. by fixing bugs) and which add new content. My biggest complaint is that it crashed on startup the first time I played it (A common problem, I have heard) but the issue is easy to fix.			",20,5,0,5,2,0,7

												This game is pretty much the only option for a casual/intermediate level of grand strategy for the long 19th century (1836 - 1920). To enjoy this game fully you should get the 2 dlc available for it (Heart of Darkness and A House Divided), since they flesh out the period in important ways. Without them, the game can seem quite dull at times, especially when playing with a minor nation.The economic system with all the comparative difficulties in different nations in achieving a modern industrialised economy are done very well in the game. Similarly the colonization aspect is an interesting and exciting race to conquer Africa and it's resources (it is, however, handled in a very hands-off fashion without moralizing, so some may be distressed by it). The main problems in the game are the military and diplomatic sides of things. Alliances among the great nations are formed in a fairly obscure fashion, and it is difficult to get a handle on how to ensure you gain useful allies. Similarly the different international crises are quite random and don't seem to be determined by actual events in the game (for example, Poland keeps wanting to become independent, mostly from the Russian empire, but this seems to have no relation to the different revolutions or revolts that take place). Military and battle systems are not great. Battles are mostly very drawn out affairs where the person with the biggest numbers wins. There is not much drama, since you can mostly see the result of a war from the difference in initial military strenghts of the nations taking part. All in all, Victoria 2 is a good game that has some significant problems. But, as I said at the beginning of the review, it is pretty much the only option.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very enjoyable game. can get complicated at first finding out what everything does but after about 10 to 20 minutes you get used to it. great political aspect built in allowing you to change government types from Monarchies, Democracy and the two best Communism and Fascism. Has some aspect of customisation in it as if you have the know how you can edit the flags of different countries government types, for instance if you really wanted to you could make the German flag change to a swastika when you go fascist, although socialy unnacceptable you will be the only one seeing it so it wouldent really. i would give it a 10/10 as its a brilliant game, highly addictive, some customisation whilst also educational towards 1800's Earth and politics, i gained nearly my entire knowledge of politics and history/geography from this game.

												The game is very, very hard to get into. It has the most nebulous gameplay mechanics i've ever seen, it's not the prettiest game, and despite having been patched extensively, it still has a few issues.With that said however, the game is great and a wonderful accomplishment from Paradox DS. It has the most complex and exhaustive economy system in a game i ever seen, great depth with politics, economics, war and colonisation, even with the great depth the game essentially can play itself sometimes, so it's not that hard to actually play it.I would say if you enjoy the victorian time period, some alternate history, and you aren't afraid to learn something complex, this game is perfect for you.

												My hours in this game should read about 300, but I had to launch it out of steam because of a bug.  Anyways, this lets you control a country during the most interesting time in human history, the industrial revolution.  It is a Social, economical, and political simulator.  You have to colonize Africa while keeping all those black people happy.  You have to build an industry while supplying food for your growing urban technology.  You have to keep up your trade while still promoting business in your own country.  And you have to research Cultural tech and Military tech just to stay in the game			",75,7,0,14,16,0,14

												Stretching beyond the depth and scope of most 4X strategy games, Victoria II is the most intensive ""altnerate history simulator"" that I've ever played, even topping out Paradox's EU and CK series. Managing all aspects of your country including political alignment, policy reforms, managing the demands of the populace, incorporating underdeveloped or smaller countries into your sphere of influence, your military, economy, and so much more make Victoria II a remarkably engaging and rewarding experience for anyone looking for true grand strategy experience. Highly recommended, especially if you already enjoy other 4X games!			",111,30,0,22,14,1,22

												Second only to Hearts of Iron, wth EUIII running a close third. Put the three together and you've got your strategy fix for all ages (add Crusader Kings or CKII to really ramp it up).I am not sure if anyone has added the same sort of save game compatibility as the original EUII, Victoria and HOI2 had (where once you had got to the end of one game, you could load it in the next)  but I believe they are working on that. Can't wait to lead my very early formed Great Britain in EU3 into the Victorian age!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've heard recommending tVictoria II isn't so much a recommendation as a challenge and I have to agree. There is so much to do in this game, and so many layers to learn and manage that mastering it is a true challenge.I've only scratched the surface but there is so much to chew on in this game that in depth it makes EU3 or Crusader Kinds look like a kiddie pool. It's much more akin to Hearts of Iron except it's easier to manage.A unique game set in a poorly understood period of history. Go on I challenge you.			",286,87,3,103,44,3,86

Will France, after losing the Great War become fascist? Who will lead the world in automobile production? Have Brazil lead the scramble for Africa. Have Egypt form a pan-national Arab empire.

												Victoria II is a very linear game that takes you though the key events of the mid-1800s to the mid-1900s, such as:- The American Civil War- The Meiji Restoration of Japan- The rise and reign of terror of the Fascist Orange Free State- The Great War, including a monumental simulation of the famous ""California Campaign"" by the Communist forces of the Cherokee Nation- The Great Depression of 1907, where the sudden drop of the price of glass destroyed the world economy beyond repair- That time when the Chinese Empire westernized and proceeded to completely slaughter the combined armies of France, the Netherlands, and HungaryHighly recommended for those of us who pine for a ""history"" game that is truly historical.

												Paradox game, set in the Victorian Era, that means lots of colonialism, industrialism, social revolutions and wars, and also lots of cruel acts against social liberties/human rights depending on what part of the world you're ruling in (southeast-asia, africa, middle orient, etc)It's a Paradox game: some people cannot stomach so much detail, options, content, etc., many feel that Paradox games are boring and just ""too much"", I recommend watching some youtube before purchasing this game, AND then, if you've bought it, by ALL MEANS do the tutorial; of course, console cheats don't hurt either (especially to get some BIG money if needed...without money you can't do♥♥♥♥♥♥..and what's the point of playing a RTS when you can't do♥♥♥♥♥♥..?)But keep in mind that once you've mastered the gameplay (+ the console cheats just in case) this game is, currently, THE best 1839-1939 RTS game out there...

												(Note: even though Steam says I have less then 1 hour played in this game, that is incorrect, as I have several hundred hours played, I just don't use Steam when playing)Victoria 2 is probably one of the best but most complicated strategy games ever made. The sheer scale and scope of it will blow your mind if you haven't played a Paradox game before (actually it still will even if you have). But once you start to understand its systems and the time period, your mind will really be expanded. The politics system and the economics alone are more detailed, realistic and complex than anything outside of a high-level supercomputer simulation (and certainly more so then any other game I know of).It is daunting to learn the complexity of this game, but fortunately you don't really need to master all the systems in order to be able to play fairly well (you can get-by without understanding everything). And the more you play the more you'll master it and, like I said, by the time you've done that you will literally be a smarter person. The game's mechanics are complex enough that you cannot really predict the outcome of things in the long run (like which countries will come to dominate), because it's all based on complex systems interactive with other complex systems to create the ultimate complexity. Which does a good job of simulating human history,The vanilla game is good, but it gets much better with mods. Of which there are lots. There's tweak mods, overhaul mods, alternate history mods, etc. But the one I would recommend for both improved gameplay and improved realism is POP Demand Mod (it's probably the closest you'll get to actually directing history).This is a game where you take a nation from the 19th century, very much into the 20th. You can industrialise as an advanced European colonial power, or start as a primitive country (like say China or Japan) and if you play right, you can race ahead and catch up and even overtake the Europeans. By the end of a game you're likely to be in a very interesting world, with Monarchies, Democracies, Fascist and Communist states fighting it out in world wars. You will never have the same end-game world in more than one playthrough, so you're creating alternate history as you go.If you're into hardcore strategy and/or history, then you've got to experience this game.

												I love this game so much. It's a life changing game. Before I couldn't tell you a thing about the Industrial Revolution or the geography of the period. Before this game I had no interest in the period, little interest in history period. Then this game comes along and fundamentally changes my interests.This game is very difficult to learn, but once you figure it out it is a game you can put a couple hundred hours into easily. It's probably one of my favorite games of all time			",96,20,0,26,16,0,35

												This game is great for anyone who likes to think, you need to manage your attention. There are also enough achieveable objectives to satisfy any level of gameplay, from novice through to strategy gaming pro; so you can spend many hours blissfully unaware of your surroundings as you conquer the world. The historical events are also fun as you can play with history (creating Germany in the 1840s slightly changes the Franco-Prussian War). All in all, I would recommend it highly as it has provided me with many hours of enjoyment and some great multiplayer games :)			",31,16,0,10,10,0,10

												In my opinion, this game is the best way to start playing Paradox grand strategy games. At first, game interface is easier to understand. Importan thing about the game is industrialism, you have to adapt your country, your citizens to consume much and keep them continue their life happy. Research points are also very important, increasing literacy rate of your country has directly effect your developement agaist rival countries(nobody wants to lose war with 100.000 soldiers against 50.000:) After building a strong industry, you need to supply factories mostly from overseas like Far East and Africa. Colonization is also very important issue, after mid game a Great Power country should have some colonies from overseas, Africa is easy to connect from Europe even for American countries. I suggest this game to people who has interest for 19th century history or pre WW's age how most of today's superpowers begin their journey(adapting new policies or form strong nation) to split from rest of the world. A full game will last around 30 hours of gameplay but time will change drastically concerning about your game style.Personally I recommend this game to strategy lovers especially whose want to start playing Paradox Interactive grand strategy games. After then you will get addicted to grand strategy sub genre games like Crusader Kings, Europa Universalis and Hearts of Iron. My point is 8.5/10 to this lovely game:)			",70,7,0,6,10,0,12

While you can automate a lot of functions, if you want to master the game (esp win with the larger countries) then you'll find yourself dealing with hundreds of units and staffing & trade across vast national industries. It is worth it once you get past that sharp learning curve and you pick up a lot of history on the way! By far my favourite strategy game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a well fleshed out game, and it is both a classic and well-aged game. Grand Strategy will probably never again have this well a game, and especially not with so much diversity of mechanics as well as depth of mechanics. Clearly Europa Universalis IV shows that. This game is for the true appreciators of history, and as such is not an easily stomached game. Once learned, it is one of the greatest, however.			",178,38,2,29,53,3,48

												All this game revolve around building a strong economy (building factories, promoting industrialization, securing ressources). The most interesting thing to do, is to dominate the world with just a small country like the UK or Ireland as a great poower. Or industrialize China and makes other country go bankrupt due to market price crash. Or make Russia more literate than Germany.			",33,12,1,19,17,0,15

												An excellent strategy game. Has quite a steep learning curve, but it provides an excellent simulation of economic, diplomatic, political, demographical, and technological phenomena during the Victorian era. Also it's really fun to crap on the world as the American empire :3			",263,29,0,20,40,1,72

												If you liked Europa Universalis 3 and Hearts of Iron 3, Then this is a good filler for the history gap between the two games. You start just after the colonial era and now have the ability to build factories and steer your country to being a great power, Its expansion also add vareity by giving you the chnace to control the fate of the US in its infamous civil war. This game is well worth the investment if you enjoy the genre and you wont be dissapointed.			",303,102,8,61,125,1,94

												I was afraid that this game won't be as good as first Vicky. Now I'm sure - it isn't. It's still great, if it's not better. The only thing which is problem for me is graphic - I prefer normal static 2D, not 3D(game slows on my PC). That's all - GREAT EU GAME. If you like strategy, thinking, and obtaining self-choised achievements - it's game for you.			",178,39,6,34,33,2,50

												While EU4 and CK2 have eclipsed Vicky 2 in both technical and gameplay terms, the Vicky series still fills its temporal and game style niche in the Paradox line of games.  While the newer games make Vicky 2 look outdated and unintuitive by comparison, I often miss the focus on industry and politics that the other games shy away from.  With Vicky 3 on the distant horizon, my enjoyment from its predecessor and Parodox games in general makes it an automatic preorder!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Do you like pie charts? What about the 19th century? How about the lead up to the Great War? If your answer is no to all of these please keep looking for other games. If your answer was yes then please buy this game. Victoria II (AKA Vicky 2) is one of those Paradox Interactive Grand Strategy games, the start and finish stretching from 1836 to 1936. One-hundred years of gameplay during the Victorian Era and you get to pick whichever nation you want. Do you want to form a Greater Germany with the Austrian Empire in the fold? How about an Ottoman Empire that never lost it's status in the world? What about making Texas a North American Great Power (Yes this is possible just VERY difficult)? A lot can be achieved in this game if you take the time to learn how it works.Speaking of which a lot of people seem intimidated by these sorts of games, and I really do not blame them. In the whole listings of Paradox Interactive titles this one is pretty simple compared to the later ones. That's not to say Vicky 2 is for dummies or somehow not good enough, just that it is deceptively hard. You do not need any sort of degree in geopolitics or mathematics to understand what the game is showing you. There are a lot of very good guides out there for this game and I heartily recommend the wiki for the game itself. The pie charts are easily readable and each POP (population) is easily identifiable, making knowing your citizens a lot smoother.Another thing to know is that If you want the full experience with this game make sure you buy HoD (Heart of Darkness). It fleshes out the colonisation a lot more and makes the whole Great War idea actually possible to happen in all your games. Now this does not mean you are forced into fighting these wars (Unless your nation is dead center for the war) so you can just stay out of any fighting. However doing so will cost you prestige in the eyes of the world, which if you stay on top of your military technology then you should not have much to fear. Just make sure to read up how to make good army compositions first.Lastly if you enjoy history or alternative historical situations then this game is for you. Would you like to keep the Qing Empire from falling apart? Or perhaps a communist Austria? Many, many things are very possible in this game. As of writing this game is 5 USD so if you plan to buy it now is the time. If you do I sincerely hope it is the game you are looking for. It can look daunting yes but give it a chance and you could learn quite a bit from it :)			",103,14,0,28,23,0,33

												Although it doesn't look like I've played it very much, I actually have, and enjoy this game very much.(The reason why my hours appear so few will be explained) So don't pay attention to my play time. I easily have over 300 hours. It would just never launch from steam, so I would have to go into the game files and launch it from there.I'm pretty sure this game caused the death of my laptop. It was way too overworked with all of my ridiculous nations I made in the game files. (Balkan Union, Adria, Guyenne, The Earth [Coring all of the provinces of the Earth in the files was difficult], Countries that would destroy the Ottoman Empire, so forth)			",21,2,0,2,8,0,10
