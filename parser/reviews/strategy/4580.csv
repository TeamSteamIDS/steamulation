												Alright, Dawn of War Dark Crusade, where to begin? This game is by far the best Dawn of War game to date, including Dawn of War 2 and its expansions. If you're an RTS fan, there is little here not to like. (Also, you don't need to own the original Dawn of War OR Winter Assault to enjoy this game)The gameplay is simple and very fun, you start out with a base and a builder unit, you proceed to make buildings filling various roles such as research, unit creation, and defense. You proceed to make a base and units to defend yourself, and you eventually attack the enemy. You have two resources, power and requisition, power is used for vehicles, upgrades and research, requisition is used for everything. Requisition is easy to get, just capture points across the map and fortify them with listening posts. Power requires you to create power generators, but bases have a limited amount.Campaign is simple, you pick a race, and you are given a map divided into territories, each territory is provides you honor guard (Elite units to defend your commander) and a planetary requisition bonus (to buy honor guards or defenses for territories, or buildings if you get a specific plot of land) The map is turn based, with you and the 6 other AI going to territories and trying to claim them, when you attack or defend a territory, you are put into a basic RTS battle. If you win, you get/keep the territory, and whatever buildings you made (not research, though) on that territory. You are also rewarded for attacking/defending, allowing you to get wargear for your commander. Your commander can equip new items that can change your playstyle with him/her or simple make them better. Now, the best part of campaign is the stronghold missions, these missions are when you attack another race's main territory, so instead of destroy the enemy HQ, you are presented other tasks, such as destroy these artillery units to stop part of the map being bombarded or kill this commander and get these soldiers to fight for you. Strongholds are very long, hard and entertaining. The game has a nice selection of races, each filling a playstyle.Tau = Strong ranged units, good offenseEldar = Stealth based, fast movingOrks = Melee swarmImperial Guard = Ranged Swarm, great tanksSpace Marines = All around, good melee and rangedChaos = Kinda like Space Marines, Melee focusedNecrons = Slow as hell, turtling, but can be near unstoppable when they do attackMultiplayer and Skirmishing is fun, pretty basic for an RTS but with bots or people, and your own rules.The graphics and sounds are nice, the graphics show battles in their full glory, with colorful explosions and blood flying from units, and the sound includes powerful gunfire and units yelling in battle. Not much more to be said, the game looks pretty and sounds like war. The soundtrack I do give a shoutout to, its very nicely done.The only real thing I have a problem with this game is the crashing I get. Sometimes in a match or on the menus my game just freezes up or crashes on me, its not common, but commen enough to add it to this review. I think RTS or Warhammer fans will really like this game, given you didn't buy it already, 9/10, great game, but some crashing and freezing stops it from being perfect.Also check out the mods for this game, some of them are very nifty.

												This game is so inspiringly coitus inducing that I played it for many days in the darkness of my cave under a single blanket made of hemp rocking back and forth and refusing to leave the game unattended to go to the toilet, for food and for water. My wife  left me 3 weeks ago because I became engulfed by the need to purge the enemies of the imperium. This game destroyed my life, and I would do it again if I could. This game is like heroin. The more you take, the more you need to survive. I have lost 7 pounds in a week because of this game, much like heroin. The difference between heroin and this game is that you only buy this game once and it's legal. Don't do drugs. Drugs are bad. Like heroin or a pineapple pizza.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Pros:+ Solid storyline+ World conquest for a main campaign... as any of the playable races+ Vast array of playable races, all with different playstyles+ Bug-free+ Classic RTS Gameplay+ THIS is how a Dawn of War game should be done+ Multiplayer is still fantasticCons:- None, really.Overall: This, imo, is the pinnacle for the first Dawn of War game.  Soulstorm is fun, yes, but this game came first, hit all the right notes, and Soulstorm just tried to mimic it.  Being able to play the campaign for world conquest with any playable race is fantastic, and the addition of so many races makes multiplayer even more frantic.  By far my favorite in the Dawn of War games.Bottom Line: Worth playing and replaying... and replaying... and replaying...			",189,38,0,72,11,0,30

												This review is coming from someone who has been with this game since the date it released, I was professional ( sponsored to play ) In the early days of the game. By far the best RTS your fingers will ever touch. My hours will shine light upon this statement.Pros-7 Races but somehow cleverly balanced ( Tau and necron are broken but can still be countered ) -Active friendly community in the sense of I see a lot of the same people everyday helping them improve and befriending them so we can have a lobby of 8 players who all know eachother.- One of the best resource systems in any RTS very simple to learn but a huge part of the game.- Micro can be used to an insane degree.- Macro can be easy to learn.- Decent graphics and voice acting for how old the game is.- Space marines, Chaos, Orks, Eldar, Imperial Guard. Oh My.Cons- Steam servers have messed up a some multiplayer aspects of the game.-no more stat tracking ( you cant see how many games a person has played/won )-Sync errors happen every once in awhile very low chance but none the less really annoyingbugged lobbys- Having to own every prior expansion to have all the races.-Sometimes the population of the game will have 200+ people online at other times 20 people online.I highly recommend getting this game when it goes on sale and you can pick up all the games at a low price,otherwise I suggest every RTS fan in existance should own this game. It really is something amazing.I had no idea what Dawn of war was prior to this game, it shaped my habits as a gamer, and got me into computer games. So if you have the money pick up this game and learn how to play it, it's incredible. A game I wake up early in the morning to play before class, that's detication!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dark Crusade was probably my favorite RTS throughout my college years.  While my friends were busy playing Starcraft, commanding the forces of Terrans, Protoss, and Zerg, I was busy fighting wars in the 41st Millennium, taking on foes ten times my greater and defeating them with honor and earning glory.  This was also the version of Warhammer 40K's Dawn of War series that got me into modding, giving me a sweet, sweet taste of what the penultimate prize of Modding experience would be promised to me upon getting Soulstorm.If you've ever gotten the previous two, Dawn of War and Winter Assault, you'd know gameplay-wise that nothing's really changed.  However, with the addition of two new factions; the popular Necrons and the mysteriuos Tau Empire; and new units for all other factions (including Grey Knights for the Blood Ravens, which remains my favorite unit choice to this day), it definitely shines in front of its predecessors.  That, and with an awesome campaign where you can play not just one but all seven factions, promising continuous replayability even after you've beaten the campaign once...there's nothing here that's  not to like.I'd be a fool not to recommend Dark Crusade.  Any RTS player would be a fool to deny that this game stood the test of time.  Stop reading the review, fork out some cash or grab that debit/credit card, and get the sodding game.  The best part about it all is that the multiplayer options are compatible with all versions and are standalone, so you only need one game to have fun.  I recommend giving it a go, it's worth it.  Let's keep this game alive.  For the Emperor!			",139,24,1,20,13,2,34

												Dark Crusade is an improvement on the mechanics of Dawn of War and adds new factions, units, and a world map-based conquest mode as the campaign in the game.  For those of us who enjoyed standard scenarios and multiplayer this is entirely an improvement.  Unfortunately, for those of us who were more caught up in the story-based campaigns where a story unfolded before you as you played, that feature no longer exists.The world map does offer a few advantages that I will admit are enjoyable.  First off, you feel more like a true commander as opposed to a company leader in the prior Dawn of War iterations.  You decided on where and when battles will take place and often those decisions are based on which provinces offer the most requisition (currency) and benefits for your units.  The enemy also acts with the same goals and will actively invade your territory if it sees fit, bringing the battle to you.The unfortunate part to this, in addition to the loss of a well developed story from earlier campaigns, most of your battles end up being frantic zerg fights where you churn out your units and upgrades as fast as possible and slam them into the enemy until they are dead.  Obviously, the old strategies do apply, and the classic rock-paper-scissors aspects of the units remain, but I myself always felt more caught up accomplishing objectives and advancing the story.It was a toss up for me, as you may have guessed after reading the above, but I have decided that I'm going to recommend this game since it will satisfy previous DoW players who enjoyed the basic scenarios even if the heavily story-based campaign is gone.

												If I had to pick a single RTS from my collection to recommend to a friend, or really anyone with a remote fancy for strategy, destruction, and all out war, it would be this one. Dark Crusade was the expansion DoW needed; adding both the Necrons and the Tau, two races unprecedented in their leels of badassery, and a smattering of new maps that outshine anything you played on in the previous DoW releases. Chaos still steamrolls & Imp Gaurd are still silly, but whether you're a fan of 40k or just the great genre that is Real Time Strategy, DoW Dark Crusade belongs in your collection.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dark Crusade was, in my opinion, the best game of the Dawn of War series. It gave players more freedom than the previous two games with its multiple factions, while not suffering from the recycled concepts and poor storyline/voice acting of Soulstorm. The RISK style dynamic is one that I have found inherently fascinating, and one that I hope that Total War: Warhammer will exploit in the future. My personal highlight of the game, and probably the series overall, were the stronghold assaults. With entertaining storylines and objectives that make it feel very much like a special mission in the tabletop game, I found them to be a refreshing and rewarding experience. My one gripe is what seems to have been faction favouritism amongst the production team. Multiplayer combat is made less enjoyable when people play as the Eldar, and make their webway gate invisible, warping it all over the map, and forcing you to adopt time-consuming  strategies to beat. Overall, however, the game rates among my personal favourite RTSs. 9.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought Dark Crusade way back when it first came out and I'm glad to see that it's back now, kept alive on Steam. Having played the singleplayer portion of the game to it's max, I can safely say that this is the best Dawn of War game out there to get (if you can get only one of them). Although it has slightly less features than its successor, Dawn of War - Soulstorm, the campaign experience is much more comfortable, rewarding and has better writing and more interesting characters too. Soulstorm is only worth getting if you want the latest and fullest multiplayer experience (along with the original Dawn of War and Winter Assault for the remaining races).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Warhammer 40,000: Dawn Of war: Dark Crusade: Black Scuffle is pretty cool I guess. Set in the distant future of the 41st Mellenia, Mankind has decided to show aliens just whos the boss of this gym by beating them all up. 10,000 years after their Jesus figure got cripple, humanity now has to fight an endless war across the stars for total domination against aliens and other humans that don't like them very much. The planet Kronus, located on the edge of an alien empire known as the Tau, has suddenly been thrown into an all out war between numerous different factions. The Tau themselves, a highly advanced alien race that relies on ranged weaponry and the help of other aliens for close combat, basically the nerds of the 40k world. The Imperial Guard, regular humans who fight with flash lights and balls of titanium. They also have big tanks and scary men who wear cool hats.The Eldar space elves who think they're smart but actually aren't. They also accidentally spawned a chaos god a few thousand years ago because they wouldn't stop having planetary scale murder orgies.  So like they're ones to talk about short comings of other races.They suck, I hate them.The Necrons, grumpy robot skeletons who were awoken because of all the gosh dang racket going on up stairs. Now want to destroy all life.Orks, space fungus soccer hooligans that can't stop shooting and punching everything. They're fun guys to be around.The forces of Chaos, evil humans that worship the gods of Chaos. Like to summon daemons (it's spelled like that in game) and get into bar fights. They're jerks. And of course there are the poster boys, the Space Marines, roided up super jocks that are like 8 feet tall and poop pure rage. Each race battles for control of the planet, trying to accomplish their own goals and thwart the plans of others by sitting down and discussing the matter like civil adults.I made that up. They kill each other hardcore.Now, I bought this game at launch, over the years I've accumulated about a hundred hours or so all together and only recently got a CD key from Sega for the steam version after Relic servers shut down. Dawn of war is more or less a traditional style RTS with a focus on base building. It's big thing is that your main resource comes from nodes you need to capture and secure on the map instead of building farms or something like that. This means that there is always a threat of combat as your enemies head out and attempt take points from you, furthering their resource gain while crippling yours. It's an aggressive way of playing that makes you constantly push your units forward instead of just turtling in your base.There is also a toggle for most units that lets them switch between ranged combat and melee combat, giving you another layer of strategy. There are units that specialize in ranged combat and units that specialize in giving wedgies and shoving you in a locker. It adds another layer of strategy as how to build your army. Your firewarriors may have a powerful ranged attack, but sooner or later those angry green rioters are going to reach your firing line, and then you'll look silly. Good thing you have these goofy bird looking guys that like to hit things with sticks, so you can happily fire away while your Kroot friends literally eat their enemies.  Gross. Single player is actually pretty neat. Instead of having a mission to mission story, you instead fight over the planet in a risk-style fashion. Each army has a pre-set number of locations where they can use points to reinforce their territory and buy special units for their army. While it can get kind of dull fighting for the same territory, it makes up for it with the stronghold missions of each faction acting like a more traditional kind of RTS mission. The voice acting is...Pretty friggin great. It's like a bunch of Shakespearean B-actors yelling mad banter at one another. This all being said, should you play Dim Expedition? It's pretty great, it adds a bunch of stuff to the last two games while also having a really neat competitive aspect in the form of multiplayer. If you can get it on the cheap, you should do so, but chances are you already have this game, considering how old it is.Dark Crusade gets 4 aliens yelling at one another out of 5.

												Unlike the previous games in the series, there is no real level for level campaign. You are presented with a planet-spannding map and move your hero to different areas. RTS game style starts when you get on a piece of land that belongs to the enemy. These matches are just like normal skirmishes from the earlier games. Only certain spaces (Enemy HQ, vital locations like spaceports) have a real objective and a neat little game-engine-made cinematic.Sound deserves a special mention here. The music is one of the best I ever heard in games, cinematic quality,  and the voice acting is great too, but a bit cheesey sometimes, tough that fits.Another great feature is the army painter, in wich you decide the color scheme of your units. Sadly this does not work in campaign mode where you play with fixed armies.Sadly I can't cramp more into this little box, as I could go on for hours, but this game is one of the better sci-fi strategy games out there.

												This is, at least IMO, THE Dawn of War game.The Pros:+ Campaign is amazing, Destroy HQ was much more fun than Annihilate IMO.+ Characters are charismatic, badass on their own right and are voiced really well.+ New races are not minor races that only a select few likes or even knows about (adding dark eldar over tyranids was a smart choice, guys)+ Skirmishes are fun, especially when you play destory HQ or annihilate in a 8 player map as a free for all in which case the game just becomes a huge, yet glorious ♥♥♥♥fest+ The last Dawn of War to give it's new commanders voice lines (Carron and Boreale kept Eliphas' and Thule's voice lines and only had different voices in the campaign which honestly upset me the most)The Cons:- Necron and Tau are really, REALLY powerful.- All strongholds in the campaign constantly send you harrashing units and large hordes, and they might come in and ruin your base while your units are trying to stop the production of another group of units. This was especially thing that annoyed me in the Tau stronghold cause there were SNIPERS SHOOTING AT YOU that needed detectors to smack down and you had to take a longer route if you did not want to bump into the units protecting Unity Plaza while taking out the production posts.- Eldar were not nerfed and are still just as annoying as they were in the past.- The classic ""hunt down the last ♥♥♥♥ing webway"" returns, glad that was fixed when Soulstorm came out.- You can NOT move your units around as soon as they start attacking an enemy unless you click on a listening post/relic/building/etc, they will just sorta attempt to move there and just go ""lol ♥♥♥♥ that i gotta kill this warp spider that is almost about to kill ME"". This was a glitch and got fixed when Soulstorm came out though, so that is great.- Chaos was still in need of a new vehicle unit but we got a Daemon Prince instead, I mean that is cool too but damn they could have brough the Hell Talon or at least a Dreadnaught along with the Daemon Prince!

												I thought the first game was the peak. the expansion Winter Assault was good but is short length hurt it quite a bit.(I am also a die-hard 40k fan, so I am also a little bias in the review, you have been warned)This game however far out-classes all before it (and to an extent after it). The addition of two new playable factions, those being the Tau (Space commies with Mech suits and angry rooster people) and my personal favorite faction in all of 40k, The Necrons (Spooky scary skeleton robots), of course all the previous factions return with a new unit or two (Imperial guard get weapon teams, Chaos now lets you turn your lord into a daemon prince, etc)This game also adds a new between-battle map screen where you can upgrade your commader, train an honor guard, reniforce captured provinces and, of course, attack your enemy. Most of the battles are just basic multiplayer style skirmishs against the computer (with the exception of some missions that give you a space port or a daemons fury) but, in the heart of the enemy lines, there is a more mission based level, much like the previous games, that if you can conquer, that faction will be removed from the game, an you'll most likly get a wargear out of it too.Out of all the 40k games I have played, this is probably the best and most lore faithful (with the exception of the necron/human mix the Parias, they're gone now), sure it plays nothing like the table-top game, but lets be honest here. If it did play like 40k table top, the game would be alot slower and several hundred dollars more costly (But no less awsome)8.5/10			",155,26,0,18,6,1,16

												If you like warhammer, or just want a good strategy game, you should choose this game. It plays pretty much like a standard RTS, but with some elemens like points. Some points gives you recources with which you buy units and some give you a bigger chance of winning.The campaign is great, and while I have not finished it I can tell you I like it. It plays similarly to risk, except its up to your own skill and not blind luck to win.There are seven races, all of which plays differently and have different strengths.And if you have to choose between Soulstorm and this, definetly choose this.

												This was and still is an absolutely awesome game, intense, fun and epic in scope. The rts genre hasn't since produced anything even remotely so cool and fun - and I'm counting Starcraft 2, which isn't bad ofc, but the focus on mining and producing hundreds of units takes away the thrill of combat. The new Dawn of War remake on the other hand focused too much on the micromanagement of units, losing somewhat the feeling of epic battles.Remember those eight player games, artillery tearing the infantry to shreds, tanks charging, massive bloodthirsty demons trading blows with the Eldar Avatar, bodies, blood, blaster fire, laser beams and the endless yells and screams everywhere? God, this game had atmosphere leaking from every pixel of pictures and every byte of sound.Warhammer is about killing the heretics, any time, all the time. Take their land. Burn their structures.

Realistic battle-system with many factors influent on it. Spectacular and striking shootouts and melee skirmishes. Exciting campaign with an ability to choose fraction. Every way opens new storyline. Opportunity to create a huge army or multiple independent squads on player's choise. Graphics for RTS on maximal parametres are great, even for nowadays. Beautiful effects included.

												There is no denying that Dark Crusade is the best game in the Warhammer 40 000 Dawn of War franchise. Everything is balanced out very well in comparison to the original and the first expansion Winter Assault. The game offers you and you the possibility to have a more diverse army and not rely solely on the top tier units such as Terminators, Possesed Squad or Warp Spiders.                 The Campaign is also fantastic and has an allure of a classic 40K tabletop game. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dark Crusade is the second expansion to Dawn of War and advertised as a standalone expansion as well. It should however, not really be played as a standalone. The complete absence of any sort of tutorial or incremental introduction of units and technologies makes this an incredibly hard place to start for new players as you're essentially thrown into the deep end from the get go and just hope you learn how to swim before you get overwhelmed. To add insult to injury you can only use the two new races in multi-player unless you already own Dawn of War and Winter Assault.The two new races are very nice additions however. The Necrons are a pure powerhouse, the immortal machine servants of a long dead empire, serving vicious and hungry gods. In game they play quite differently from the others, ignoring usual resources and tactics their build speed is determined by the number of strategic points you own making them a very slow starter, to compensate their units are unusually tough and sometimes even resurrects themselves upon death. Lategame they transform into a steamroller as even their Headquarters becomes a flying, teleporting doomsday machine.The second new faction to be introduced is the Tau and they similarly play differently from the old factions although not quite as big a deviation as the Necrons are. The Tau are a strange mix of specialists, heavily armed but poorly armored weapons platforms and a variety of beastly allies. The biggest difference between them and other factions is the lategame choice of either going to the heavily armed but poorly armed weapons platforms or the huge beast allies they can also summon as choosing one path excludes the other.The single-player changes gear from the previous installments and replaces the linear and scripted missions of Dawn of War and Winter Assault with an open campaign map in a Grand Strategy style. Each faction starts with a stronghold province and must conquer the rest of the map as you play along gaining various bonuses from their conquests including various pieces of wargear for their leader. The problem with this concept is all the maps in between the various strongholds are just plain boring, both in attack an defense. Although the map changes it all plays much the same and it comes down to pure grind very quickly.The stronghold attacks however is where the game gets interesting. Challenging maps with multiple sub-objectives and small video sequences before and after makes them the only bright side of the new campaign.In terms of graphics and sound it maintains the same quality as the main game. A thunderhammer still makes a satisfying thump when impacting a traitor's breastplate and the Ork's still scream out their one word with relentless fervor.That feel that comes from the WH40K universe still exists, but the grind of the campaign makes it have much less of an impact than in the original. Still a good expansion, just not an exceptional one and definitely not one to be played as a standalone game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The defining moment of the Dawn of War series was and forever will be this game here.  Taking the pros of the earlier Dawn of War games, adding two very unique and powerful races, and letting you play as ANY faction on the main campaign is so good... it will sadly ruin you for every other Dawn of War installment, including the shiny newer ones like Dawn of War 2 and Dawn of War 3 when that comes out.  You cant go from 8 well fleshed out, expertly voice acted factions to 4 or 6, with only the Space Marines playable in the campaign... going back to those restrictions feels like pouring cement in your shoes.

												For the Emperor? Bah! What heresy is this? When the Dark Crusade hits, nothing can stop the march of the Necrons!Dark Crusade is the second expansion for the original Dawn of War and it adds two new races; the Necron and the Tau Alliance, as well as brand new conquest campaign and a multitude of new units for the old races. Both new races play distinctively different from the other teams and Relic has done its best to ensure plenty of options for you experiment and tinker with to have hours upon hours of playtime. Unfortunately, time has not been so kind to the game's presentation. Conquest also grows rather monotomous as you continuously have to rebuild, regroup and reengage on every new map. It is eventually best enjoyed with other players in the  beefy multiplayer department. With plenty of game modes and even the option to paint your army in your own custom paintjob; just like the table top game. All in all, the expansion adds more options, more time and more fun to your warfare if you're into the warhammer universe. It is well worth its price, especially considering today's rates during sales, and when comparing it to the investment of getting into the tabletop game.			",192,21,8,22,19,2,33

												The Very Game that introduced me to Warhammer 40k. Back around '07, friend had in disk form. Borrowed, loved it (more than Warcraft), and got it from him. The best part about the DC CD back then was that you didn't the CD to play it: install it, good to go. ok enough memories. let's talk shopfun game, it can be played causally. it's mod friendly. Game is Fully voice acted. Warning: Chaos units shout a lot, it annoyed my cousin when he played (lol). While Units are not Hardcore detailed (easily changeable through mods) but it does the job pretty damn well as the bits and pieces pop out. it also helps increase framerate because of the broad details, and there is going to be a mass of units.You have the Campaign, the voice acting pulling you into the intro. Battle map with different faction having a world war. Each with different quirks and you play one of them. Getting started (fighting the first few battles) is easy and used as a teaching tool and a way to explore the different units, if you don't plan on using the tutorial. Gameplay: the first game that I experienced that a unit has both melee and ranged combat. Explosions!! that actually does knock back!Abilities. Blood. Jumping assault units. Warcries. Deathcries. Blood!! Semi-gore pieces. More Blood!! Special melee kill animation (Sync-kills). Super Units. Heroes. Separate Cap for infantry and vehicles for full battlefield. BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD!!Flamethrowers ^yes it gets its own line Basically, what the picture and video has.Experiencing all that in a single battle makes me drool.AI is pretty easy and repetitive unless you go high difficulty. Maps ranges from small 1v1 to large 8 player maps (Mods to get more and/or bigger maps)Customization is a little limited, being able to change the color of only a few pieces sets of the whole army, but still fun in my opinion. changeable Banner and flags (mods for more, or easily make your own)I have little experience with multiplayer, so I can't review that portion.I Highly recommend it. For the Dark Gods!  ",135,16,1,26,10,1,31

												Definitely the greatest version of Dawn of War out there. Gameplay, visuals, voice acting, everything is top-notch. The single-player campaign is entertaining, replayable and VERY atmospheric. If I should name one strategy that I enjoyed the most during all my years of gaming, I would immediately spit out ""Dark Crusade"".10/10 would fanatically exterminate all the alien species again.

												Probably the best Real time stratergy game ever made!Singleplayer:Space Marines, Imperial Guards, Eldars, Orks, Chaos Space Marines, Taus and Necrons.The story mode contains 7 different races on a big planet. At the start of it, you have one area on the planet which is your stronghold (every race have a stronghold which is a heavily defended and fortified). You capture other areas by fighting the controlling race in Real time on a map. Most areas unlocks an honor guard that you can recruit, so when you fight someone again, you start with that troop in the begining of the fight. (example: an honor guard for the Space Marines could be a small marie squad that has more health than your regular marines + more damage) The planet map is turn based with a very simple resource managing. When capturing an area, you will recive X amount of resource points to spend on honor guards or reinforcing locations after a turn. The singleplayer also contains a Skirmisher mode, which allows you to choose map, what opponents to fight and victory conditions. It allows for training (because the AI can be quite a challange) or just for fun. The MultiplayerI have not actually played much of the multiplayer, but from what I have played, its fairly stable and fun. But it does have a few issues, mostly relating to syncing issues and clients lossing contact with each other. This game also have tons of mods and awesome expasions for free! I recommend the Titanium Wars mod. Over all, this is a fantastic game with tons of replayability! 9/10 ",363,50,5,26,28,3,38

												This one adds some new qualities to the Dawn of War style of RTS. The campaign is structured in a more non-linear way, allowing you to choose what areas you attack, whether you want to defend an area yourself or let the computer figure out what happens. It's like they spliced in elements of Risk, while maintaining the base building and combat mechanics you've come to expect from Dawn of War. One thing to note is that you should save often, because if you screw up a mission you'll lose your turn. Also, when attacking an area build the best base and defenses you can because if that area comes under attack by an enemy you automatically start off with all your structures. This would have been nice to know at the start, as I've pretty much screwed myself over and have to wait a few turns to build resources. Prepare for a little less forgiving experience, and a little more strategy in your attacks. Anyway, it's still Dawn of War and that means it's good.			",251,98,2,51,11,0,32

 Very fun and not repitive! Everyone should buy this game, and try it at least once, either you are a Fan of Warhammer40k or not!!!You can play as these very remember-able races from the WH-40,000 universe:  Tau empire! - For the greater good! Chaos! - Burn the galaxy! Orks! - Moar dukka burna choppa!  Space marines! - ""good guys"" Imperial Guard! - Space ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s!aaand Eldar! - To save Craft-World! What's so ""different"" in this RTS game, and why should i buy this rather than Red Alert 2? Okay, you should go ahead and buy Red Alert 2 if you had the chance, but about this game:Really god damn high zoom level, with a 360o turning feature! To see the battle unfold next to you!Very balanced gameplay, with no Meta-Strategies winning every time... eh...  NECRONS, THEY EXIST - ""We can come back to life, and 1 shot your greatest tank with only 4 troops"" And a lot more stuffy stuff steff. Lastly , but not least i recomen you \___N E V E R___/  play this game if you're completely new to RTS,because it's basically a straight up upgrade to old RTS, and if you don't know how to play it, the tutorial is ""kinda""okay but won't tell you about advanced stuff like number binding, group selecting or others... you'll get r*ped.All by me!

												In the grim dark future of the 41st millennium, there is only war.In this standalone expansion to the epic series of electronic games known as Dawn of War, you can command armies of the Tau and fight for the Greater Good, or take control of the sinister Necrons and destroy all that crosses your path.Well, that's my lacklustre ""epic introduction"" done. Dawn of War - Dark Crusade adds the Tau and Necrons to the list of playable factions. While you can play as any faction introduced in Dawn of War or Dawn of War - Winter Assault in single player, unless you have both those games you can only play Tau or Necrons in multiplayer. Apparently there's a mod for this but I'm not entirely sure it's legal, so I don't have it. Being banned isn't much fun, and I like Tau anyway.The campaign uses a RISK-style map, and you must conquer the planet Kronus and drive all other factions off it. This being Warhammer, all the factions are lunatics, to a greater or lesser degree. If you're unfamiliar with Warhammer, stop. Why are you unfamiliar with Warhammer?The available factions in this game, for those of you who for some reason are unfamiliar with Warhammer 40,000 or its fantasy counterpart, are:The Tau. Blue space communist who fight for the Greater Good. Useless in melee.The Space Marines, super-buff guys in powered armour. Nicknamed Catholic Space Nazis.The Imperial Guard, the less-superpowered allies of the Space Marines. Technically part of the same faction, but they're separate armies so whatever.The Eldar, high-tech space elves on the brink of extinction. Ridiculously overpowered in this game, since they can literally turn their whole base invisible and field ridiculous amounts of troops.The Orks, fungus-based humanoids who just want to kill stuff for fun. Completely ridiculous but oddly endearing, they run partly on duct tape and space magic.The Necrons, Egyptian-themed immortal robots who hate everything living.Chaos, a collection of space demons who worship evil gods. Evil by Warhammer standards, and there are Warhammer factions that make Adolf Hitler look like someone's grandfather. Unless of course he is your grandfather, in which case I apologise.Now, if you had to have all that explained to you, go and study Warhammer 40,000. You scrub.*The game is an RTS, since it's based on a tabletop wargame, and quite a good one. Instead of training individual units, you train squads. The graphics are a bit outdated and make some of the units look silly (Chaos Marines look adorable, for some reason) but having played Minecraft, literally anything is a step up. Boy do I love bashing Minecraft.Pathfinding occasionally throws a tantrum and units randomly mill around before moving on to the point where you want them to go, but apart from that the game is generally fun to play and well-balanced, if a little outdated. Unless of course you count Eldar, who are ridiculously overpowered.If you're a fan of Warhammer, and you like the Tau or Necrons, I'd recommend this game.*Please note that this is all said as a joke. Most people will know this, but there a few people who will leap to the comments section to rant about me calling non-Warhammer fans ""scrubs"". ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've been playing Dark Crusade for years.  I first got it in 2013 on Amazon along with the base GotY Edition and Winter Assault.  Hands down, it's up with Red Alert 2 and Age of Empires 2 for my favorite RTS's of all time, the big three that I'll never be able to properly decide between.  Its squad based mechanics, its perfect combat pacing, the base building mechanics (take notes, DoW2), and the sheer variety of playstyles between each race just make it a must have.  It also has technical perfection behind it, with very few compatibility problems and full widescreen/high-refresh-rate support.  It still looks good in 1440p and 144 Hz, and its visuals (while the ground can be a bit blurry) still stand out as more than adequate for the job.  The terrain scarring still looks nice and there's no standout bad visuals.Why am I dropping my review on Steam so early, though?  Well, I just have to point this out; Sega has been amazing with the property.  After adopting THQ's Relic IPs and the company in the big crash, Dawn of War 2 had a GFWL patch that moved the game over to Steamworks.  Eventually, Dawn of War 1 had a similar patch, removing the Gamespy roots.  LAN mode was sacrificed in the process, a sad exclusion from the new version, but nonetheless I feel that it was a great move to continue support for the game.BUT IT DIDN'T STOP THERE.  Sega's support team has allowed just about anyone to go over to their Support Site and request a Steam key to replace retail copies.  So, I finally gave this a shot on Friday night.  By Saturday morning, I had a nice response asking me for a few more things, a picture with a support number, the game, keys, and receipt... or I could just provide what I had and they would try to help me out from there.  To be clear, I wasn't expecting to get my keys-- it was an Amazon version of the game, only three years old, and digital download rather than a physical box.  Nonetheless, I provided the information and submitted it Saturday night.This morning (Monday), I got a new response:Hi lol you don't need my name! Get outta here!Thanks and enjoy your Steam games!Please follow the steps below to redeem the voucher and download your game. The direct download is provided through Steam and will require you to first download the Steam application and create a Steam account. If you already have a Steam account, skip to step 3.1) Go to http://store.steampowered.com/about/...(more steps for the Steam-illiterate and product codes at the bottom)After entering the code your download should begin.Please let me know how obvious accidental cutoff here.  Definitely not a bot, then! Best Regards, (support guy's name I won't disclose but nonetheless you are appreciated)I thought GOG support was a one of a kind experience, but Sega is just on point.  Every request I've sent their way has been a smooth experience and Relic/SEGA's continued support for a game now 12 years old (9 in DC's case) they're not profitting off of anyway is admirable.  The fact that they've been even bothering to provide keys for old customers is great.  The best part?  THIS ISN'T ISOLATED!  They've done the same for their older Total War games as well, including Medieval II and Rome!Make no mistake, SEGA is an excellent company.  Yes, they make some strange decisions from time to time, no company's perfect; but nonetheless, over the past year they've earned a dedicated customer, and I'm sharing this so that you may be too.  This is a company that treats its customers right and deserves every bit of success it gets.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Here's how you win:1. Play Necrons2. Go for Spaceport so you can attack anywhere, then go for Fury.3. In game now, make your monolith as defensible as possible.4. No units need to be made, only scarabs and monolith upgrades. Maybe build the spiders so you can move them.5. Use your scarabs to get the monolith to the stage before awakened. That is priority, but when not building the summoning cores, have your scarabs build turrets, power cores or obelisk.6. Get the tomb building thing to upgrade the Necron Lord.7. Get the upgrades that let you turn invisible, heal you over time, and whichever else you like.8. Get the Reaper upgrade thing.9. Briskly walk your Lord over to the enemies' base. No need to build an army. If you have starting units, have them help defend your base.10. Attack their HQ.11. If you die, simply revive, you'll respawn where you died.12. To speed up the process, use the Reaper state thing.13. Have all your home turrets upgraded to the best they can be, and do not settle for enough, this region can be attacked in future by a more powerful race, so keep it fully loaded.14. If you run out of Gauss Turrets, make more monoliths so you can make more turrets.I've never lost.10/10 game for making an unbeatable race.			",27,10,0,7,8,0,6

												A must have for any RTS player who likes building army's with basebuilding, this time u can even paint and logo your own army and banners.The resource collection and economy works different, u capture 3 diffrent type of points, most are requisition points, one power and one relic is all u need. most armys will get lets say their main income from requisition points except the necrons as far as i know, for them, power is the main income.power works different as well, it also works as income, so the more u build or the more power points u take the more income of '' power '' u get.u spend requisition and power on buildings and units / expanding units and on upgrades.and the last one, relic points are one for each player in the map, capturing this will grand access to lets say the superweapon unit and the elite units of your army.all points can be defended by building outpost on them and upgrading them, except power points, u need to build around them to defend them, this can also be done for the other points.u build using working that are different for each army as well as the starter units from the HQ.so that is basicly how it works and its more easy then it sounds really.there are tons of races, units and buildings and tons of upgrades, when u think u are done and upgrade your main, everything has upgrades again.painting your own army and giving them logo's and creating your own banner is also unique to dawn of war.every race plays different in building and in army.all the expansions and the original have great campaings two of them have a risk like campaign map with some ingame cinematics.9/10 cant with for dawn of war 3 wich will come out this year.

												Excellent gameplay and Strategy. All fans of the Warhammer franchise who have not played its older games should buy and play through them, they will be surprised by how much fun they are. Soulstorm in particular has great factions, a vast array of weapons and characters and vehicles, excellent modability and surprisingly good graphics for its time. I would higly recommend it to any fans of topview strategy and large map multiplayer combat.			",50,1,0,0,5,1,18

												I've been playing Dark Crusade for years.  I first got it in 2013 on Amazon along with the base GotY Edition and Winter Assault.  Hands down, it's up with Red Alert 2 and Age of Empires 2 for my favorite RTS's of all time, the big three that I'll never be able to properly decide between.  Its squad based mechanics, its perfect combat pacing, the base building mechanics (take notes, DoW2), and the sheer variety of playstyles between each race just make it a must have.  It also has technical perfection behind it, with very few compatibility problems and full widescreen/high-refresh-rate support.  It still looks good in 1440p and 144 Hz, and its visuals (while the ground can be a bit blurry) still stand out as more than adequate for the job.  The terrain scarring still looks nice and there's no standout bad visuals.Why am I dropping my review on Steam so early, though?  Well, I just have to point this out; Sega has been amazing with the property.  After adopting THQ's Relic IPs and the company in the big crash, Dawn of War 2 had a GFWL patch that moved the game over to Steamworks.  Eventually, Dawn of War 1 had a similar patch, removing the Gamespy roots.  LAN mode was sacrificed in the process, a sad exclusion from the new version, but nonetheless I feel that it was a great move to continue support for the game.BUT IT DIDN'T STOP THERE.  Sega's support team has allowed just about anyone to go over to their Support Site and request a Steam key to replace retail copies.  So, I finally gave this a shot on Friday night.  By Saturday morning, I had a nice response asking me for a few more things, a picture with a support number, the game, keys, and receipt... or I could just provide what I had and they would try to help me out from there.  To be clear, I wasn't expecting to get my keys-- it was an Amazon version of the game, only three years old, and digital download rather than a physical box.  Nonetheless, I provided the information and submitted it Saturday night.This morning (Monday), I got a new response:Hi lol you don't need my name! Get outta here!Thanks and enjoy your Steam games!Please follow the steps below to redeem the voucher and download your game. The direct download is provided through Steam and will require you to first download the Steam application and create a Steam account. If you already have a Steam account, skip to step 3.1) Go to http://store.steampowered.com/about/...(more steps for the Steam-illiterate and product codes at the bottom)After entering the code your download should begin.Please let me know how obvious accidental cutoff here.  Definitely not a bot, then! Best Regards, (support guy's name I won't disclose but nonetheless you are appreciated)I thought GOG support was a one of a kind experience, but Sega is just on point.  Every request I've sent their way has been a smooth experience and Relic/SEGA's continued support for a game now 12 years old (9 in DC's case) they're not profitting off of anyway is admirable.  The fact that they've been even bothering to provide keys for old customers is great.  The best part?  THIS ISN'T ISOLATED!  They've done the same for their older Total War games as well, including Medieval II and Rome!Make no mistake, SEGA is an excellent company.  Yes, they make some strange decisions from time to time, no company's perfect; but nonetheless, over the past year they've earned a dedicated customer, and I'm sharing this so that you may be too.  This is a company that treats its customers right and deserves every bit of success it gets.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Here's how you win:1. Play Necrons2. Go for Spaceport so you can attack anywhere, then go for Fury.3. In game now, make your monolith as defensible as possible.4. No units need to be made, only scarabs and monolith upgrades. Maybe build the spiders so you can move them.5. Use your scarabs to get the monolith to the stage before awakened. That is priority, but when not building the summoning cores, have your scarabs build turrets, power cores or obelisk.6. Get the tomb building thing to upgrade the Necron Lord.7. Get the upgrades that let you turn invisible, heal you over time, and whichever else you like.8. Get the Reaper upgrade thing.9. Briskly walk your Lord over to the enemies' base. No need to build an army. If you have starting units, have them help defend your base.10. Attack their HQ.11. If you die, simply revive, you'll respawn where you died.12. To speed up the process, use the Reaper state thing.13. Have all your home turrets upgraded to the best they can be, and do not settle for enough, this region can be attacked in future by a more powerful race, so keep it fully loaded.14. If you run out of Gauss Turrets, make more monoliths so you can make more turrets.I've never lost.10/10 game for making an unbeatable race.			",27,10,0,7,8,0,6

												Ok, where to begin?I've been a fan of warhammer for only a few weeks, andmy friend who plays it reccomended this game to me, so i gave ir a try and i loved it. The gameplay is satisfying and fun to play around with, the army painter is really helpful for deciding your color themes both in this an your real life collection, the army choice is nice, with it including 7 races, along with the factions within those races, such as space marine chapters, tau septs, ork clans, etc. but it could have some ore armies in it that could be nice, such as tyranids and dark eldar. The camera is a little sensative at times, but other than those 2 things, i would very highly reccomend this game to both warhaer fans and non warhammer fans alike.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What an amazing expansion. Not one but TWO new races, both of them awesome and so different to the existing 5. The DVD cover was reversable, so you could favour Tau or Necrons, with awesome artwork on both sides. This game has such fond memories for me. I was loving Winter Assault multiplayer and playing it non stop for what was probably a couple of years, and then this bad boy was announced and it was most exciting thing ever. And the game didn't disappoint. What it added was EVEN MORE variety. Two massively different new races with some new concepts (no requisition for necrons!!?) made the game feel unlimited. We already had 5 completely different races and every multiplayer game was different, with a varying combination of races, map, and players. Sure there are some balance issues and a couple of technical issues but these are completely forgivable when the game is this good and even more so when you know the rest of this story (Soulstorm..DOW2..)A golden age of RTS, the climax of Dawn of War.

												I love Dark Crusade, There is nothing like watching the Righteous Adeptus Astrates take on the forces of Chaos and primitive fools, And the eldar ofcourse. This game will get your blood boiling and the blood running, I recommend you get the zoom out mod, Other than that, The game is damn near perfect, Seeing massive armies decimate one another in glorious combat.I have beat the campaign as most races, All but necrons and chaos, it never gets old, But even better is the skirmish maps, Me and my friend once had a 4 hour battle against two tough AIs, I was Space Marine, He was imperial Guard, He gave me artillery cover while my Adeptus Astrates decimated wave after wave of Eldar and IG, over 40,000 must have died, It was glorious like no other game can be.15/10 Must buy if you like brutal massive warfare RTS games.

												10/10I've played (to some degree) as every faction. I haven't played thru to the end, but I've gotten the farthest as Tau. I bought this on May 20th, 2016. I tried it with a controller, but realized it was mouse-and-keyboard pretty quick. Tried Skirmish, didn't like it much.  1 day later, I discovered Campaign Mode, and played as Tau. It was ok, I guess, but at first, I had trouble keeping enemies at bay and keeping my strategic points. Heck, I didn't even know I could add squad members until about 2 months ago. I hold a victory celebration after every major victory. A major victory is taking out a faction completely, though a minor victory is taking a certain region. I suggest you get this. 10/10. Or much rather: 10000000000000000000000000/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While the initial two releases were amazing in their own ways and the sole post-release release of soulstorm is deeply flawed, Dark crusade stands well on its own, not bogged down by lore or the need to play prior/later instalments, and easy to manage. The champaign is fun, and while the maps may be similar, what happens from map to map usually isn't, as the enemies can sometimes defeat eachother. and usually this's a pretty fun variance, though the defense AI is probably not worth betting on. though if you just buy this online all you can play as are the necrons and the tau, which id say is the sole-and largest- downside about this game. that asside, the modding comunity is massive and fantastic, and the game's fun, fantastic music.basically its a good RTS with fairly well designed factionsjust watch out for the eldar. seriously.

												The happiest gaming hours of my gaming career. Its sad to think that this little comment of mine is more of a epitah then a recommendation, but in essence thats what it is. I loved the mystery of the game, it added a whole new universe to fight in, in your own way kinda like the Total War series but better because of the fact that there is a deeper connection, and lore based history. The mass of the battle were the best thing ever especially when you played the Imperial Guard, and held the line for countless hours with your line of bolter turrets, and Leman Russes (not to mention the guardsman wih their handy dandy flashlights). I just loved it theres no other way to describe it. The towering and spiring cities. The massive factories, and munofactorums. The story lines, mystery, and darkness where you want to huddle your forces together against the horrors of chaos as your men die in hundreds, and thousands. I just wish that like I said this wasn't a sermon to a dying video game, and my homage to it. In my personal opinion I want someone like Creative Assembly to build a game off of this ne of a massive universe reborn, in the still smouldering, fighting,and ultimately dying game that is the Dawn of War I, Aand II series.

												I used to have this game on disc, I'm so glad I was able to pick it up again, all of these years later. This game is really the meaning of ""Traditional RTS"", set in the Warhammer 40k Universe. Dark Crusade includes 7 Factions to play as, including the T'au Empire and the Necrons of Kronus. The campaign has been changed entirely, into a risk type of game. The objective is to conquer the map as your selected race. To make booting another race off of the map a bit more exciting, each army (including your own) has a ""Stronghold"". This is basically the main base of the army, you could even consider it as a boss battle. Now I will move onto a more brief list.Pros:- 7 Armies, each can be played in the Campaign. Replayability can last a while.- Balancing is fairly good, some things might still be considered a bit ""OP"".- The pinnacle of the DoW Franchise.- Multiplayer has still been kept online to this date, about 10 years later!- Each Army has a different playstyle, rather than just using the same tactic for every army.- Quite a large learning curve if you are new to the franchise.- In my opinion, this is still better than it's successor, Dawn of War 2.- Variety of unique units for each faction.Cons:- Multiplayer community is quite small here, though it is still alive.- This game isn't really a ""Pick up and be good"" game.- Some units do have slight pathfinding issues in some cases, like the Necron Monolith.- There isn't really a playable story. Though there is a background story to the campaign, it's not like Winter Assault or Dawn of War.Even though it isn't perfect, I would reccommend picking this up any day. The latest Dawn of War 1 game is Soulstorm, however Soulstorm has it's fair share of dis-advantages. I'm just gonna put it this way; Dark Crusade for the Singleplayer and vanilla game, Soulstorm for the mods.11/10 would dakka again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dawn of War: Dark Crusade is an exceptional RTS. I guess the biggest complaint that I have would be that its alittle like Starcraft BUT WHO CARES?! You command freaking massive legions of the most powerful armies in the WH40k universe, its got this Dynasty Warriors-esque meta-campaign, you can customize the colour palette of your armies, and its a stand-alone expansion, no vanilla game required.

												Dawn of War: Dark Crusade still holds up as amongst the gaming greats even 14 years later. It is much loved by the community that playthroughs of expansions, mods and even the original games still go on today on YouTube. It's also one of those rare gems in which the sequel game could not live up to. Well balanced game mechanics, a great challenge in your enemies and decent AI make for true atmosphere in a dark age where in the grim future of the 40th Millennium, there is only war.

												I rate the game Warhammer 40k: Dawn of War - Dark Crusade 4/5. Good. This is far more than a simple add-on to the largely mediocre Dawn of War. This is an excellent and fairly vast expansion. In terms of its overall structure, this is probably the best Command and Conquer style ""RTS"" (Real Time Strategy as they are called, though applying the term ""strategy"" to this kind of game may be a little bit of a misnomer as most ""RTS"" games includes relatively little actual strategy but more often merely include certain tactical elements) I have ever played. It's most notable strengths are that it allows you to play as one of many different, unique factions, each faction has its own ending and the global-scale battle map allows the single-player campaign to give you, the player, a great many choices as you attempt to progress through the war.But this game is not without flaws. Indeed, this game, particularly the single-player campaign, has some fairly serious flaws.An example of The Good (if not Great):+The single player campaign map gives you excellent strategic options. Remember the old between-mission battle maps that were found in some of the oldest Command and Conquer games? This mode works a lot like that but instead of letting you select either one battle or another, your options are much more varied. If you capture the sector which has the spaceport your options become even more numerous because then you can attack most places across the globe. Likewise, capturing certain other sectors gives your forces certain other strategic and tactical benefits which make an enormous difference as the campaign progresses. This between-mission global strategic map mode is a truly excellent feature which lets you choose how you want the single-player campaign to progress while showing you your options (or lack thereof) and letting you see how your campaign is progressing. It is a feature I would honestly like to see in every other ""RTS"" game ever made as it offers unparalleled choice and strategic options well beyond what most other similar such Command and Conquer style ""RTS"" games ever come close to offering you. The inclusion feature should set the bar higher for every other command and conquer style RTS to follow. For me, this feature (combined with the inclusion of the Tau as a fully playable faction) made the game for me and made me want to keep playing the main campaign through to its conclusion.The Mediocre:+/- This game requires you to make heavy use of your lightest infantry units. This severely limits the number of tactical options which ever become available to you while at once causing the body count in each battle to rise dramatically. This makes some sense for certain factions (like the Imperial Guard) but makes less since for other factions. Worse, the Imperial Guard factions still don't have unit sizes which seem to ever be large enough or populous enough while the Space marine units never seem to be durable enough for them to be remotely canonical. The Tau units take casualties far too often as well for them to be canonical. When playing as the Tau or the Eldar the game should penalize you (severely) for taking heavy casualties but it doesn't. All factions require you to heavily rely on infantry before building ANY tanks or other vehicles (making the game all too command and conquer styled for my tastes) and units do not seem to ever level up or gain any experience for being in combat which further decreases this game's tactical depth. Ideally, Imperial guard units should automatically include huge numbers of soldiers and some tanks should be available from the outset. Tau forces should heavily rely on tanks and their APC units from the outset. Necrons should be very, very, very slow (much slower than they are shown to be in this game) but almost indestructible. Space Marines should be much, much more durable but much, much fewer in number. (Remember, in Warhammer 40k, there is said to be fewer space marines than inhabited planets in the galaxy) and they cannot afford to lose the sheer numbers they lose in this game (and neither can the Tau or the Eldar or the Necrons). Since all the factions play so similarly to each other (and none of them truly play like they really should) the tactical options are severely limited as a result and the battles are, as a direct result, much, much more repetitious and uninteresting than they could have been. From what I can tell from reading a few of the Warhammer 40k codexes, what we have here in these Dawn of War games is not really Warhammer 40k, but something with its name that sort of looks like it but doesn't really feel much like it. Still, the world of Warhammer 40k is a big one and so there's some room for my suspension of disbelief. However, this game should also be highly commended for the sheer variety of factions which it attempted to include and everything it did well about each faction (especially their voices and sounds they make when responding to orders). The great many factions and thus the great many campaigns which this game includes greatly adds replay value to this game. My Tau campaign lasted over 30 hours. I'd imagine other campaigns would take just as long as well.The Bad:- The singleplayer campaign is blatantly unfair. In the single player campaign, battles wherein you attempt to attack and take over enemy strongholds or main bases all have additional, almost unfair objectives which must be completed. (I found the Necron main-base to be worst because the mission would automatically fail if you failed to get your little commander-unit out alive (and this is not true in any other battle and that particular battle tried hard to make this objective particularly difficult resulting in some frustration.) Now needing to complete extra objectives to take over an enemy base is fine, if the game was fair about it but this game isn't remotely fair about this-EVER. If an enemy attacks YOUR main base then you only have one or two little bases and all the CPU computer enemy has to do to make you lose the ENTIRE game is to destroy those one or two bases. The CPU must complete absolutely no other additional objectives to defeat you. To make matters worse, regardless of which side you play, in terms of number of main-bases you are very nearly always out-matched in every battle, whether you are attacking a main base or not. In the vast majority of battles in the main campaign the enemy has at least 2 main bases when I had just one (and I was playing on EASY difficulty. Indeed, One might think this kind of blatant, in-built unfairness is due to the game's essentially poor AI but this game doesn't seem to have poor AI. The enemy AI actually acted quite well. And, of course, on higher difficulties the AI responds more quickly and acts more aggressively. The AI is at least adequate to provide excellent challenges when all things are equal (though it is of course less creative than a person can potentially be). Honestly, I don't think that the kind of in-built unfairness that I mentioned above needed to exist in this game and it made for a needlessly frustrating experience. However, I should mention that RTS games are generally NOT my main forte. Unless I'm playing Homeworld Cataclysm, RTS games are games I am generally not very good at. Maybe there should be an option programmed in to make the main campaign blatantly unfair or not if those who are great at RTS games need additional challenges (something like a Pro or Expert mode).-Space Marines still look cute and huggable in this game (big feet, little heads, big shoulders, puppet-like animations).

												Fun game with a risk type mode that can be pretty enjoyable, much better than the next one where you have to rebuild everything each time you are attacked in that mode.  Biggest downside is how badly the ai cheats in this, I have played against hackers that feel more legit than this ai. There is no fog of war for computer. The orc Warboss or Necron Lord will teleport right into the middle of your troops that are way in the back behind your front line, and hidden by the fog of war, maybe even infiltrated and land right in the middle of them constantly. Jump pack troops will perfectly time their double jump to coincide with this, and all of them perfectly skirt the range of your turrets when it suits them. Makes the game more challenging but you watch a few replays and its hard not to feel you are getting cheated.Soulstorm is the one to play, (though ai will behave the same as already noted) unless you are wanting to play the campaign mode and NOT rebuild 100% of the map everytime you defend since it also has Dark Eldar and the Sisters to play. Except for those two things games are nearly identical.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a great game.Its not like the two original games Dow 1 and Winter Assault in terms of campaign, instead it has a map where you conquer provinces; each with their own unique conquest gift, such as: Honor Guard. They is a mechanic where you can develop your character with certain new items, which can turn the tide of battle. Overall you can play as seven different factions, this gives it alot of repaly value.The AI may not be as intelligent as Soulstorm; which is a lesser game however, on hard difficulty they can still give you a run for your money.The only issue the have with the game is that their is a certain balance issue with Necrons however, it doesn't spoil the game one bit. Overall however this is a great game and is well worth the money. Hope you enjoy! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

If you are a fan of RTS games that have large scale battles, much like Company of Heroes, then this is definitely the game for you. It is truly a classic! The gameplay is fairly straightforward, which makes it simple to pick up, yet difficult to master. A simple way to put it would be:If you like Halo Wars and Starcraft, then buy it!

												As my first introduction to the Warhammer 40K universe, this was probably the most affordable and true-to-form I could get with this game. I've always known of the 40K universe but never thouht about officially dabbling in it myself. However upon catching this game on sale for a killer price I decided to try my luck at it.Turns out, I can't get enough of the game now. It has startegy elements that favour those who would charge the enemy and use brute force to run through their base.My personal favourite was using Chaos to send a Deamon Prince alongside an enormous amount of cultists into the enemy base and watching the carnage unfold.That said the game isn't without its issues. While some races have massive starting advantages, such as the Orks and Space Marines, those who favour Necrons or Imperial Guard have to scramble almost instantly or risk being put on the end of a pike.The game is unbalanaced is what I'm trying to say, as again with said Orks you can just build exclusively WAAAAUUUUGH towers and then your base is defended and you can spawn 100 Orks to meat shield their way into a base. Though may the emprorer have mercy on your soul when the Imperial Guards trudge their way at you with with 40 ♥♥♥♥ing Baneblades all aimed right at your head. They will and I repeat will ruin the entire game for you so be wary of that. The computer also cheats hardcore to get an edge on you that I swear makes the Necron campaign in particular almost unplayable even on easy.However that brings me to the best part about this game, the lore. I love seeing how each race interacts with one another as well as how each one plays, as they all have drastically different play styles.Imperial Guard gets a massive tank that can slaughter everything in sightChaos gets their deamonsOrks get stupidly high numbersNecrons never diePlay the game for yourself and find the rest.This game gets an 8/10.

												I bought this game when it came out on CD, before I ever thought of having a Steam account.  This game is still as good as it was then.Dark Crusade, the capstone of the Dawnw of War Original Series.  I recieved it in the platinum edition box with DoW 1 and Winter Assault, and I have played through all of the campaigns, some several times.  This game, combined with all of the content from the other two games, is one of the best RST titles I have ever played.The gameplay is not only rock solid, it is smooth and fluid for every faction.  I had more fun playing this RTS than any other, and I certainly spent more time on these multiplayer servers than any other RTS game in my library.  It might not have the best graphics nowadays, but it runs superbly on my (Win7) newer machine.  It is an easy game to get into, and it's very fun to play (even to lose at).One of the best RTS games you can purchase.			",157,42,2,25,25,3,35

												Picture a game of Risk. Now imagine that everytime you attacked a territory or were attacked you had to play out an RTS game with how powerful you are based on the troop points you had going into it. NOW imagine that when you fight in the same territory again all of your structures remain from the previous battle. That is Dark Crusade in a nutshell. If you're a fan of strategy games and the Warhammer 40K franchise then you will love this game. It's a standalone expansion to the original dawm of war with almost all the major factions and a variety of different play styles. One playthrough I went Necron using my Crypt Lord and fully upgraded monolith to teleport around the map as an army of two and obliterate the enemies key structures. The next time I played Tau making squads of stealth suits that would divide and conquer the map causing the enemies main force to always be in the wrong position.Grab it through a sale or any other kind of bundle and it will be well worth your time and money.

												Greetings fellow Gamers!Here we have the second expansion to a game I consider a classic that helped change the RTS genre.  Does this expansion hold up to the original?  Well…it’s complicated.  I love this series and will always be a series that I feel was ahead of its time, but it hasn’t kept up as much as I’d like.I can’t move there’s a tank next to me:  Okay, pathing feels worse, not sure if it is but it feels worse than the previous expansion.  Tanks constantly stop squads of infantry from moving around corners and with the games desire for tight combat this is something that kills the pace.  I don’t remember it being this bad but the game is very old. Still some assembly still required:  They did a good job at increasing screen resolution natively without a mod but the game still requires a zoom out mod to make the best of this, so I am happy with that.  I feel I have to say again, this is to be expected with a game this old but I don’t want to make excuses for the game.  The graphics are still passable in my opinion, not as good as any of the latest games (would like to see a DOW2 graphics version of this).Story Exists…kind of:  Again we left with a story without the focus being the Blood Ravens.  To be fair at least the Space Marines are Blood Ravens but the game moves towards a campaign mode with light storytelling, there are intros and outros and good stuff for those of us who happen to devour any small bit of fiction tied to my beloved Chapter.  Overall the campaign is enjoyable however, with buffs and bonuses you can acquire by holding certain territories and equipment that can be gained through completing challenges.  Your commander feels neigh unstoppable in the end (especially the Necron one) and you get special units that are higher quality than their normal versions.  One particular annoyance is some of the Honor Guard is single infantry units; it would have been nice to give these the ability to attach or at least give them another infantry in the squad to allow more use as they devolve into holding objectives early and sitting in base in the end.Overall, if you like DOW you should get this, if you like Warhammer 40k, still get this.  With that you should know if you want this, still an amazing game that maybe didn’t hold up as much as we’d like.  Enjoy! ",21,11,0,13,7,0,25

												Always going to be a classic, and the best of the Dawn of War 1 games. Has what I can only describe as kinda RPG elements to it with your commander leveling up and becoming more powerful as you capture, reinforce and defend different regions that grant bonuses like attacking any area or expanding your honour guard. And the Tau and Necron are easily, in my opinion, the coolest 2 races you could put together for an expandalone like this.			",508,98,7,80,33,5,80

												Dark Crusade sets you in the over-the-top-ridiculousness that is Dawn of War. The Campaign is narrated by one of the most coolest narrators I've ever listened to. I'd look up his name for this review, but it's 5am. As you begin and end your campaign your adventers will be narrated in an epic voice, and you can immerse yourself into the world of Dawn of War. The cutscenes are whimsical and magical in a way I can't describe, like with the Orks, and the Necrons, the game presents itself with a certain type of charm that I can't forget. Dawn of War 2 didn't give me the same kind of character and gameplay that this game delivers. Dawn of War - Dark Crusade brings you on an epic adventure, to an epic Campaign. The game's narrator makes your actions feel truly noble, brutal, or just downright awesome. The gameplay can't be compared to something like starcraft or command&conquer, it is a truly unique way of presenting RTS with requisition and relic resources. It's simple, makes some sense, and effective.The gameplay itself centers it's focus on your units and their various personalities. Like with the Imperial Officers shooting their own soldiers to gain morale, or the awesome Necrons and their units. The game's Campaign is just fantastic and epic, with a charisma that is almost on par with the Disney movies, but for gamers who love Dawn of War. Dawn of War-Dark Crusade, a game I can't forget.

												As a straight RTS; this series is better than StarCraft/WarCraft.But know going in, this game doesn't do custom maps, you're getting just a strategy game.  Nothing more, nothing less.Dark Crusade is probably the best of the series if you don't count mods.Seven playable races.Multiple heroes per race.Many maps.Ability to paint and badge your own soldiers with every color of the RGB 255/255/255 rainbow.If you're skeptical, go find the Game of the Year edition.  Download the Demo, play that.The only critisism I have is after SEGA aquired the game from THQ they patched it to no longer possess LAN support.  Which really ruffled my feathers and wasn't quite as planned...			",394,68,7,64,48,5,91

												Easily my favorite RTS of all time!There was sooo much about  what made the original DoW series great that was completely forgotten in the DoW2 series. I personally think that this was even better than the final installment  in the DoW series ""Soul Storm"", as the single player campaign was way more immersive in this one. The massive scale epic battles of the original DoW series have been replaced for smaller more tactical combat these days, and thats not what 40k should be about. The MP was a perfect balance (starcraft 2 style) spread amongst very wildly different races and species. This game and Space Marine I think completely nailed the feeling of what 40K should feel like in video games. Had it not been for ""Last stand"" mode I might not have even bought the new series.  I have put more hours into this game than any other in my history of PC gaming, (played the boxed version so don't let Steam playtime fool you) and recommend it for any RTS fans , and a must own for fans of 40K.

												Warhammer 40,000 Dawn of War - Dark Crusade is good, solidly prepared RTS with relatively aesthetically presenting a transparent graphics and UI. It features also good multiplayer (although it could be better), and interestingly resolved single-player campaign. This is a fairly simplistic game - in terms of the number of controlled units and buildings, and the complexity can be compared to Warcraft 3 If you are looking for games suitable for a loose network play - it's worth. If the extremely elaborate campaigns, diplomacy, economics and inspiring storyline - search on :).			",66,7,5,9,8,2,14

												Dawn of War - Dark Crusade is by far the best Dawn of War game and in my opinion is one of the best RTS around. Just like many other RTS's the objective is to destroy your enemy and you have an abundance of ways to do this, whether it be spamming solders in an attempt to slowly tear apart their defences or even to let the enemy pass over your fallen allies then resurrecting them behind them and crushing them. It’s a really diverse game and can be played in so many different ways, my personal favourite play style is too build lots of vehicles and supply cover and a fall back point for my allies. This works out well but only really for the race Tau considering they have a lot of long ranges tanks that can deal a lot of damage with the safety of fog of war. Anyway in the end I’ve loved the game since the first day I played it when I was a kid and personally I put it up there as my favourite RTS followed closely by Age of Empires 2 (Haven’t played it check it out, bit old but hey so are you)Thanks hope I helped you decide whether to buy the game, if you want to know more just ask.Peace ♥♥♥♥♥ ",95,12,2,11,6,1,15

												Dawn of war dark crusade is by far the best in the dawn of war series. its true to its RTS building and giant hordes. the graphics are now dated but decent enough on high settings to look good when zoomed out. and what make this different and bettter from the first two DoW is the variation in the maps, the fact you can use widescreen, more factions and the campain is more open and not just a liniar series of missions. this combined with the large still active fanbase and thus functioning multiplayer that is still fun and not grindy.overall a superb game and well worth the price. 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First thing, i need to mention this again and again, so its repeated throughout this text. DO not buy this stand alone if you want to play online. buy the pthers aswell.This game is amazing, mostly balanced and you can easily just reply as all the races (Multiplayer as well but you need winter assault and the original for full experience, but the game is amazing so you are going to buy).1) All races are OP which makes it balanced? In a way. For example the orks can create infinite turrets and free units about mid way. The necrons (terminators basically, cannot be killed) can revive themselves automatically or harvested for more troops. Chaos can have millions of troops. Tau can shoot from out of fog of war, elder create web way gates everywhere and there invisible... the list goes on2) There are plenty of different styles; due to the diverse races and how you play them... you already have yourself an amazing game. Each race is different and not all rely on just running at the enemy.3) Persistent body’s (nuff said). Ever played age of empires or mythology and wonder what would happen if the body’s did not disappear? Imagine 3000 body’s just scattered (this has happened; it was a stalemate for 2.5 hours). 4) Troops are not essential like dawn of war II which means you end up replacing space marines like imperial guardsmen lore wise... idk it just mixes it up a bit for me and makes it dramatically less dull.5) The campaign is entertaining and the multiplayer is as well. You will enjoy the game... you will love the game... the game is all round... just pure awesome.*Side note* There is no need to buy soul storm after this, unless you want to play as bolter ♥♥♥♥♥es (sorry my friend calls them that and i have forgotten their real name) and dark elder. Then they apparently made it unbalanced with air units which ruined the game...The only bad thing though is that some races are more OP than others which is a shame, but that’s only if you know how to use them, for example the necrons can attack you from the get go while the elder can just TP to your base if they build web way gates. Personally I have no quarrels with the game and found it 9.6/10 with only very minor problems. Hopefully you found this entertaining, please up vote if I helped you make up your mind.

												In the Emperors name, you will purchase this game.Whether you're a w40k fan or a real time strategy game fan, you'll love Dark Crusade.It's incredibly fun, you'll be charging into battle with your enemies, constantly repeating anything your units say.If you've played the original game of Dawn of War, you'll definitely feel at home with Dark Crusade, it's more of the same but much much better. Based on a world map that you can invade other provinces instead of following a campaign story is much better.The W40k universe is so huge and so fantastic that you'll be fascinated by the Imperium of Man with their Soldiers, or the God Emperors Space Marines, the dark necrons, or Chaos Space Marines... Or perhaps the Eldar or even the technological Tau with their Greater Good philosophy (or the orcs... but who likes them? ;) Haha).Set on the planet Kronus, you'll find yourself in the middle of a bloody war, a dark crusade. Where one faction will triumph and the total annihilation of all others. Make sure that it is YOUR faction. You can play as any of the W40k factions that you've grown to know and love... Or at least you'll come to know and love if you haven't experienced a W40k game yet though.Don't let the franchise fool you though, it's very easy to get into the frachnise, this was the first W40k game I've ever played (back in 2006) and I've played all of them since (and the ones before). I'm not a fan of the figures or the board game though, even though the games are based on it... Shh! Plus the CGI movies/clips are awesome. The whole W40k universe is fascinating.Anyway, about the game.It's a typical real time strategy game, construct buildings, construct units from buildings, defeat the enemy. That's a simple run down of it anyway. All of the maps are static too. So when you've built a base in a province, if you're invaded, your base will be exactly the same as it was when you first built it. But any buildings destroyed in the next battle will be gone, but also new buildings will stay obviously. So definitely plan ahead when you first build in a province. (SPOILER: I've found myself trapping an enemy in a small corner of a map and building a huge base all over the map before I destroy them, so that my huge base is persistant if anyone invades it... But that's kinda cheating hehe)It's a very fun game, but don't take my word for it, check out videos of it on YouTube and many of the other reviews of this game.If you enjoyed this game, be sure to get SoulStorm, it's practically an expansion of this game and includes another faction, instead of battling all over Kronus, you'll be battling across an entire solar system on a variety of planets instead!Get everything W40k""So long as the enemies of man still draw breath there can be no peace.""""Ever vigilant.""

												I have always been a fan of RTS games, my first introduction being Warcraft 3 then starcraft, but to think that anyone could still take the time and effort to make such a wonderful and worth-while game to play such as this makes me wanna Hug the world. The Dawn of War series and all it's games, Especially Dark Crusade and Retribution, Deserve a 100/10.Best games I have gotten to play in years. I highly recommend all the Dawn of War games.

												Amazing, fantastic, well polished. My favourite of the original DoW series by far. Haven't played this for a few years now and it runs on my current rig maxed out with high persistant bodies giving me a game of maximum carnage. I think first time around I must have played all the races. This time I am starting with the Tau because I like their toys. DC has an excellent single player story as you crusade your army across the planet. The game runs like a dream, in fact a hell of a lot faster than I recall. If you have never played DC let alone the DoW series, where the hell have you been living? Under a rock. Go and play them now or wait for a sale and get a brilliant title for next to nothing. Even the multiplayer has been kept alive by the devs. Now thats what I call devotion.Most deservedly a 10/10			",293,43,19,66,64,1,71

												I remember my childhood love for the table top game and when I hit that huge monetary barrier when I was younger I was incredibly discouraged. Then I found DoW and it just rekindled everything that I loved about Games Workshop's grim dark fantasy sci-fi universe. I played the games for a long time and thanks to a recent steam sale have picked them back up and am not only rediscovering my love for this series, but I have a whole new respect for the depth of the game and the level of detail to be found.A great game that I'd whole-heartedly reccomend to lovers of Warhammer, lovers of RTS games, and anyone interested in enjoying a quality game.

												Classic RTS meets a fairly interesting meta game in this one. The meta game / take over a planet by winning maps of the individual territories supplements a story, but it provides a wonderful excuse to play all other races in the game. And there are many to choose from with distinct playstyles. Tau are shooty from range. Space Marines are what you would expect. Necron are like reanimating space zombie hordes. Fun stuff.

												Warhammer 40,000 Dawn of War - Dark Crusade is good, solidly prepared RTS with relatively aesthetically presenting a transparent graphics and UI. It features also good multiplayer (although it could be better), and interestingly resolved single-player campaign. This is a fairly simplistic game - in terms of the number of controlled units and buildings, and the complexity can be compared to Warcraft 3 If you are looking for games suitable for a loose network play - it's worth. If the extremely elaborate campaigns, diplomacy, economics and inspiring storyline - search on :).			",66,7,5,9,8,2,14

												I love this game and have owned it on disk since around 2006 but it stopped working recently so I couldn’t install it on my new PC. So I went ahead & got it on steam as well as a few friends so we could play LAN together but to our surprise the LAN option was missing from the steam release which was a real downside for us since most of us had pretty terrible internet and it seemed like quite the odd thing to remove for such an old game. We did attempt to play locally using the online way but everything was far to laggy to be enjoyable so I am leaving this review as a warning to people who are looking to play LAN and or have terrible internet.Pros-	On steam-	Now has steam integration-	Amazing RTS, it’s great to play solo or with a few friends-	Not likely to lag your computer-	Does not feel too dated for its age ;3-       Online works well when you have access to reasonable internetCons-	Removed LAN for the steam release Rating the Original Box Copy 9/10Steam Copy 7/10 for missing features			",140,11,2,11,6,1,7

												One of the best games when it comes to Warhammer 40k.Can get pretty hectic but is very polished ( for its time ) and feels unlike most other ''standard'' RTS. With good voice acting and well made models feels pretty authentic, at least for someone who hasn't played the tabletop game but loves the lore and universe. Also as a cherry on top I personally love the banter the individual commanders have when sieging a stronghold.Another plus is the fact that even though this is only a expansion for another game it also acts as a standalone for the single player campaign and skirmish.

												This is more of a review of the original Dawn of War series and not just Dark Crusade. Please read on~Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War was released in the early 2000s and still manages to hold up today as a real time strategy game. It follows the design philosphies of the real time strategy genre at the time, with base building and the like while also help pave the way for the point capture system the few living entries of the genre use today. The series uses a hard counter system for its unit balance that changes from game to game, so you'll have to find which expansion you prefer. I tend to like the balance of the vanilla game the most, despite my love for the additional factions of the expansions...I can never seem to want to uninstall any entry of the first DoW series, even the notoriously mediocre Soulstorm. I was never too impressed with Relics design decisions in Dawn of War II, so I still recommend DoW 1 over it.			",322,23,14,49,82,3,112

												Very good real time strategy game. Similar to starcraft but with an overall map campaign that plays just like Rise of Nations but even better! As you conquer more maps, you upgrade the armor and weapons of your main commander making him that much more powerfull and dangerous. You also gain all kind of bonuses to beat the remaining oponents more easily.There are a lot of factions to choose (8+) and each one play very differently (except the space marine and chaos marines, which are very similar because the chaos marines are space marines converted to the chaos side). The necron for example have very slow ground units so you must build them in big waves and then you send them slowly grinding your ennemies! They are quite resilient but you ain't going to zerg the ennemy with them. And once you get your citadel flying, then boom! nuclear attack all the time on the ennemy! heheheThe ai is pretty rough even at normal difficulty. Prepare to be zerged fast in the maps you choose! Also, i noticed that the number on the map which is supposed to give you an overall difficulty factor for taking that territory is pointless. I've taken big number territory with ease and been destroyed in an instant on territory with a one difficulty rating! So i would not give too much importance to that number. From what i've seen of the factions, the chaos and space marine seem to be the toughest to beat. They are fast even with their infantry, they got troops that can fly and bypass all your defense while striking in your backline and they are tought. A bit unfair for the other factions tought.

												I love this game and have owned it on disk since around 2006 but it stopped working recently so I couldn’t install it on my new PC. So I went ahead & got it on steam as well as a few friends so we could play LAN together but to our surprise the LAN option was missing from the steam release which was a real downside for us since most of us had pretty terrible internet and it seemed like quite the odd thing to remove for such an old game. We did attempt to play locally using the online way but everything was far to laggy to be enjoyable so I am leaving this review as a warning to people who are looking to play LAN and or have terrible internet.Pros-	On steam-	Now has steam integration-	Amazing RTS, it’s great to play solo or with a few friends-	Not likely to lag your computer-	Does not feel too dated for its age ;3-       Online works well when you have access to reasonable internetCons-	Removed LAN for the steam release Rating the Original Box Copy 9/10Steam Copy 7/10 for missing features			",140,11,2,11,6,1,7

												One of the best games when it comes to Warhammer 40k.Can get pretty hectic but is very polished ( for its time ) and feels unlike most other ''standard'' RTS. With good voice acting and well made models feels pretty authentic, at least for someone who hasn't played the tabletop game but loves the lore and universe. Also as a cherry on top I personally love the banter the individual commanders have when sieging a stronghold.Another plus is the fact that even though this is only a expansion for another game it also acts as a standalone for the single player campaign and skirmish.

 An excellent expansion for DoW, well worth the money.   Pros  Two new races - the Tau Empire and the Necrons Remastered campaign, with a different ending for each race New multiplayer and skirmish maps Fully playable as a standalone Imperial Guard is available in campaign, whether or not you own Winter Assault (!!) Cons  Campaign just sort of tosses you in, with very little explanation The game is clearly made for people who have already played Dawn of War, building on skills learned in the base game Some new game mechanics are confusing (how do I spawn units from my monolith once it's fully restored?!) Pretty much requires at least some basic knowledge of the setting to fully enjoyVerdict: I would highly recommend this to anybody who enjoys RTS games, 40K fan or not.			",84,14,0,7,5,0,16

												Now we have the second expansion of the Warhammer 40k series and not only that, but a Warhammer game that makes the campaign a little more interesting to play: by making a world map overview, where you can spend many hours stratergically attempting to conquer other Races and sections of land (similar to the flash Warlord games, I use to play) and earn points to not only enhance your army, but to improve the stats and traits of your commander, as well. The main feature of the Dark Crusade expansion is the two new races: Tau and Necron's. It took me a little while to handle Necron's but once you realize their potential, it is sort of ""gg"" from there. This also means that when you play online with your friends, you pretty much have all the available races. This style of gameplay just expands the amount of hours (depending on how much land you expand) that these games already provide. If you enjoy the Dawn of War Games and you don't have this expansion in your collection, then you are missing out, that is just a fact! 95/100!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dawn of War: Dark Crusade is arguably the best expansion in the series. It abandoned linearity within the campaign that it's predecessors had and replaced it with a Risk-like game. You have your own region on Kronus and your objective is to build up your army and conquer the other factions on the planet. It was fun, challenging, and refreshing. RTS games have never been good at conveying a story, so rather than waste time and money trying to create a story around characters that are emotionless superhumans built only for war, they went with a big map for you to have your own fun. This in my opinion was a smart decision and gave Relic more room to work with now that they don't have to create a narrative. There are of course the commanders that go back and forth with each other bickering about whose side is better. And while that may sound annoying, they actually did a really great job. The commanders feel like they have more personality and are commited to their cause while not putting the attention entirely on them individually. In my opinion, this was a step in the right direction. Because now the rest of the focus is on the military aspect of 40k (which has always been it's selling point). The Plot Kronus is an Imperium controlled world with a native population of Orks and a ever growing Tau civilization. This has caused many skirmishes throughout the planet's history and has awaken the long dorment Necron hordes. Eldar of Ulthwe come to intercept the Necrons and defeat them before they can fully reawake. Meanwhile the forces of Chaos, the Word Bearers legion arrive to take the planet of Kronus for their own sadistic needs in the name of the Chaos gods. The Orks, riled up more than ever now that there is a full planetary war want to sink their teeth on the battlefield. Led by the infamous Warboos Gorgutz, the Orks push into Tau and Imperium controlled regions to plunder the riches of the land and crush anything in their path.The Tau have called in reinforcements to respond to all of this discord. Taking full advantage of this war distracting their enemies, they are more than willing to take the planet for the greater good. And the Space Marines, mighty warriors of the God Emperor are locked in a conflict of interest with the Imperial Guard. The Guard, refusing to stand down and obey orders from the Space Marines have left the two factions of the Imperium fighting eachother in all out war. The Mutliplayer Because I covered the base factions in my last Dawn of War review I'm just going to talk about the Tau and Necrons. The Tau are a young race of aliens that have advanced in technology at an accelerating rate. Because of this they have access to mobile battle suits, advanced stealth technology, and raw fire power that can turn entire platoons of soldiers into nothing more but stains on the battlefield. I find them to be borderline over powered in Dark Crusade. They simply deal waaaay too much damage far too quickly. Have a decked out squad of Guardsmen? Not anymore! Their only Achilles heel is melee. Units like Chaos Raptors or Assault Marines can make short work of Tau Fire Warriors. The problem is, not all factions have melee units with jetpacks... Now a lot of people on the forums would strongly disagree with me that on-foot melee units like Banshees can get in Tau ranged lines. But if you are fighting an intelligent player that knows his or her weaknesses as Tau, those Banshees will be knocked down to a quarter of their squad size by the time they reach the Fire Warriors. And since most Tau players build two to three squads of Fire Warriors, expect them to be shooting the remaining Banshees.Other than just the insane amount of power they have, they're a decent faction. They lack defense turrets in their base, which means that if you attack a Tau base they have no other option but to send their forces back to support their base. This in my opinion is a reasonable weakness and doesn't make the Tau nigh unstoppable. Eldar can easily use this weakness to their advantage so it leaves some options.The Necrons....I don't know what's worse, the fact that they are completely broken or that they are possibly the most boring faction to play as. They're ungodly slow, have no satisfaction to their gameplay whatsoever, and they are so hard to kill that it makes easter egg hunts for Eldar bases at the end of a game look fun. If you are new to Dawn of War DO NOT play Necrons first. They will suck all of the fun you could be having in the game out of you leaving you with a bitter taste in your mouth. Necrons are however fun to play against with friends in team games. But outside of being just a good bad guy to fight, they aren't worth playing. Unless of course you want to be a troll and ruin everyone's day with Pariah's. The Final Verdict It's a 9/10. The campaign was great, some of the balance changes for the other factions were decent, and the two new factions were a welcomed addition despite the questionable balance behind them. However because of the two additional factions and their balance issues I have to count it as a negative. It's like no one at Relic thought about it ""oh yeah! Space terminators that can never die and are slow as ♥♥♥♥ to progress with will be fun!"" The lack of mods is also unfortunate because that means you have to get Soulstorm for mods like Ultimate Apocolypse. But overall Dark Crusade is a must buy if you are getting the base game of Dawn of War.PS: As always leave a comment if you have an opinion on the review or how to make it better. I'm always interested to hear from other perspectives.			",112,1,0,6,2,0,16

												Yes, yes, yes.This is the best RTS I have ever played. I usually don't like RTS but I absolutely LOVE Dawn of War. This game has such an immersive, epic, dark and warmongering feel to it. You just enter battle and you hear the Ork soundtrack start with the drums and all in your mind is ""Cleanse! Purge! KILL!""This game doesn't feature all the races in Warhammer 40k but it does feature most of them, and the ones left out have been implemented into the game by modders, such as Tyranids. Relic surprised me with how accurate this is to the lore and the tabletop game. Even the resource costs of troops is the same as the cost for troops on the tabletop (in the tabletop you have X amount of points to spend in a battle for your troops and more powerful troops cost more points). I haven't actually played the Dawn of War and Winter Assault campaigns because I think linear RTS campaigns are among the most boring things in this whole world, but Dark Crusade features a unique and awesome campaign mode. (Soulstorm has this campaign aswell but in much larger scale.)You start the campaign by choosing one of the races; Space Marines, Orks, Eldar, Chaos Space Marines, Tau, Necrons or Imperial Guard. All the races control different areas on a planet and then take turns assaulting other's areas with your hero, conquering them, gaining resources and honour guard (units that accompany your leader in battle who are more powerful than normal units) to spend on buying troops for all your areas or buying honour guard units. You can also unlock new gear for your hero, such as new ranged or melee weapons, better armor that give different perks, certain gear gives abilities like teleport and such, and to eradicate a race you have to assault their strongholds, and those battles have lots of different objectives and side objectives you have to do to win, like destroying different bases and if you want to, destroying bases that provide certain powerful units for the enemy so that the final push will be easier. I remember when I tried to take the Tau stronghold as Space Marine and the battle went on for like 1½ hour because they just kept harassing my base.If you want a hell of a good RTS in one of the coolest, if not the coolest sci-fi universe out there, then this is totally the game for you. I'm not sure if it's still here but there's a platinum version of the game to buy which gives you Dawn of War, Winter Assault and Dark Crusade for 9,99€, I can't find it anymore though. If you manage to find it and you're a RTS fan, then do buy it because it's more than worth it, I assure you.			",151,13,2,23,16,0,20

												I havnt played this game much, but i am planning to for a long time. This is such a satisfying game, building up your units to crush the enemy. For anyone who likes RTS this is the one.Also if anyone wants to play multiplayer with me i will be more then happy to.			",79,2,0,1,9,0,13

												Dark Crusade has been one of the best purchases I have ever made. The campaign is simple but fun and has great story arc. Only Problem with it is I just can't understand why imperial fights imperial. Oh well.However the real treat is multiplayer. Just grab some friends and it'll be a blast. Chat on skype and you'll wonder why you played anything else. The multiplayer has some issues though including that it doesn't run steam so you can't directly invite anyone.Other problems include mouse moves out of game and into second monitor so disable it and the problem will sort itself.Overall great game and probably the best RTS ever (in my opinion). I give this game 9/10.			",56,2,0,8,3,0,38

												Not too sure what to say about this one. with this one they have changed the game entirely since Winter Assult and instead you are on a map. You have to take over territories, each giving a boon of somekind and the game is over when you have driven all other races off the planet.With this change there are quite a few interesting things to note.1. Your general is upgradable. By accomplishing certain things you can upgrade your general in various ways which gives him/her boons. For example, one upgrade made it so Taldeer can spot infiltration enemies and another gave her the ability to regenerate faster and those of troops around her.2. Certain missions are far more than simply (destroy enemy HQ) and involve more difficult tasks like collecting a number of units or destroying certain objectives. All this makes it feel like they actually put thought into it.3. Invading the Homebase. The homebase battles are absolutely EPIC! Definantly buy this if you have the others.

												Out of all the DoW 1 series, this has the worst balance for multiplayer 1v1 matches. You can buy this if you want to play the campaign, or some fun games with friends, or skirmish matches and DC Mods, still a good game!For better multiplayer experience in DoW 1, get Soulstorm so you'll have more races, better balance, and more people playing. But with the coming of DoW 3, Soulstorm online might die completely as well :/			",32,5,0,16,0,0,10

There's Skirmish and Multiplayer (which still works!). You can also colour your army! Best game of the Dawn Of War Franchise in my oppinion.			",63,4,0,3,10,0,6

												100% a great game. Even on my (somewhat) bad PC [1.60GHz] it runs pretty smoothly. Overall? You will fall, just like your Gods. Nothing can compare to the Gauss Cannons mounted on Skimmer bodies. Necron Heavy Destroyers. . . But, out of all seriousness, wish they had it a bit more like Warhammer (Such as the C'Tan and the Monolith being summoned, not built), but it makes it fair. Overall, Great Game, Runs Good, Follows Warhammer 40k good, 10/10, C'Tan/Emperor.			",12,2,1,3,12,0,3

												CLEANSE! PURGE! KILL!- Space MarinesThis is one of my favourite games I have played. I owned the disk version first before steam, this game is amazing and is a must have for RTS lovers, especially those that love the Warhammer universe. You'll have a blast destroying your enemies. But take note that easy difficulty for the AI is pretty crap but when it says easy, it means EASY! no real effort needed to destroy your enemy. Standard difficulty is alright but for experienced players, they can deal with this, experienced players that want a good challenge, choose the hard difficulty or higher, it gets incredibly difficult and there are about 3 or 4 harder difficulties to choose from, hard on an 8 player map, it is going to be intense and it is going to get bloody.Summary: Don't choose easy, it is ironically way too easy.NOTE- This game used to be powered by GameSpy, and multiplayer is a big question, can we do it if we were to buy it today? The answer is yes, the servers have been transferred to steam, the game wasn't left for dead when GameSpy shut down. Multiplayer works and is functional. Note that if you don't own the original game or the winter assualt expansion, you will only be able to play as 2 of the 7 races in multiplayer, if you own the original game and this but not winter assualt, you will have access to 6 out of the 7 races in multiplayer. If you get this game, get your friends to get it as well, it is a great game to play with friends.CD keys are not needed to play multiplayer like it did for the disk versions of the game, instead you must simply have the games installed to gain access to races in multiplayer.

												Having netted over 2000 hours since it came out (before i had steam), i can absolutely confirm that this is essentially a nerd's dream. To be able to turn to pixels what they play on tabletop. With 7 races to play from; Space Marines, Imperial Guard, Eldar, Necrons (monoliths are op nerf plz), Chaos, Orks, and Tau, in an immersive campaign mode and many skirmish maps, you will absolutely not regret this game. My suggestion is that you purchase this if/when it goes on sale, as £10 for a game this old is slightly taking the mickey, but it is worth. Buy with the Complete DoW Franchise pack to get the most of your money. Then you also get SoulStorm (which is equally as good or better than Dark Crusade)Why are you still reading? BUY THIS GAME			",108,7,4,13,17,2,22

												This is my favorite of the DoW 1 Series.It carries over from the story of winter assault and DoW 1 vanilla without you really needing to know what happened in Winter assault.It has one of my favorite items the meta map.It is a strategic map in which you can attack areas within attack range ,garrison troops on conquered areas, and defend against attack.The campaign takes place on this portion to the game.All the races from DoW 1 + winter assault are included + 2 more. Each race has a strong hold on the map and in order to eliminate that race from the meta map you have to take their strong hold.Story is pretty decent and the gameplay is more polished than in Winter Assault. Each race is represented very well and the game is hardly repetitive at all.In short if you want to play on a meta map and attack in traditional battlefields this is the expansion for you. Best thing is its standalone.			",381,74,14,73,45,5,92

Posted: February 18, 2015
												I really like this game and I just finished the campaign a moment ago (for the Blood Ravens). Dawn of War Dark Crusade is an expansion to Relic's real time strategy game Dawn of War, which is set in the Warhammer 40, 000 universe of table top wargames. I highly recommend it to any real time stategy fan who loves the grittines and toughness of battles which are primarily set in a distopian future where every alien you meet wants to kill you and eat you for jujubes :D, and that's not all; Your government, which is the Grand Imperium of Man, constantly drafts new recruits in the billions in order to sacrifice to The Emeperor, who uses His powerful psychic mind in order to stave the forces of Super Hell (or Chaos for short) which constantly gobbles up any known dangerous substances in order to get high for the dark gods. The 7 major races are The Blood Ravens; The Emperor's own space marines who came to the planet Kronus to search for the secrets of their lost history. The Ork's or should I say 'Da Orks', only come for the tendency of following their Ork Chieftains for the sake of the Waaaagh!!!! in order to satuate their cravings for constant battle. The Eldar, a mysterious alien race which are a splinters of their former empire 10, 000 years prior to the 41st millenium, have come to Kronus in order to stop their ancient enemies, known as the Necrons, from rising from their tomb worlds and purging the galaxy clean of all sentient life. The Necrons were metallic warriors who slumbered eons ago iduring the aftermath, which in Eldar legend was in the aftermath of the so called 'War in Heaven'. Then there are the imperial guard, chaos and the tau (my favourite), and for that YOU can explore for yourself. For the 4 races I've mentioned there is a ton of lore to explore and unfortunately I cannot tell you all of it. If you think Halo, Startrek  and Starwars had tons of lore, you have never read the Lore of 40k, it is just a massive game world that you need to delve into. As for this game I give a solid 9/10. Please relic in the name of the emperor, where is Dawn of War 3?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

  WAAAAAUUGHIt's not a bad game and it actually makes the war feel like a war. If you like RTS's this game needs to be in your collection.  If you are new to RTS's this is a good middle of the road game to wet your feet with. There are better games but this is a good game in its own right.You fight against other races for control of provinces which you must then defend and so on..  Quite nice and unique for an RTS of the time. Only problem is this makes it rather shallow in the story department.Where else is this game shallow, Game play. There is a finite number of distinct races an RTS can have and that number seems to be about 4.  There are 7 playable factions in this game and only about 3 playstyles between them. You'll very quickly figure out  the optimal squad composition and never have a reason to vary from it. So the game play is a little shallow. Fun, but shallow .One glaring negative though is the cheating. Now it's a given that RTS games cheat a little. This one cheats a lot and quite brazenly at that. See there is a unit cap imposed, and this will always make missions dicey. Now I should explain there is a bonus called Forward Base , that allows you to start any attack mission with certain basic structures already build, for a fee. As far as the PC is concerned. It always has forward base active regardless of whether or not he obtained the bonus.. Whether you attack or defend the enemy will always have two pre-built bases.  Remember the unit cap I mentioned. Well each of these two bases basically counts as an individual player. so the end eresult is that the enemy will always have double the unit cap you do and this includes elite hero units as well. Never mind that for some of the races there are certain structures that the pc is allowed to place in ways that are outright against the gamne's rules . The Tau listening post upgrades can only be built  on strategic points when you control the tau. When you fight against the Tau you will find these defense turrets placed and where the pc wants. So the game cheats, hard.If you don't mind the cheating however, the game is pretty fun. It's a great spectacle RTS.  The combat and skirmishes are always fun to watch and the reenforcement mechanic means you have to keep a close eye on your units and  thusly keeps the battles quite engaging.All in all this is a decent RTS. Not as good as the Blizzard RTS's or THe Red Alert games , but a solid RTS in its own right.  Give it and the other expansions a try. So far I can recomend this over Soulstorm, the next game in the series, because, to be honest,  It has a tighter focus and the factions have a more unique feel.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dark Crusade was probably my favorite RTS throughout my college years. While my friends were busy playing Starcraft, commanding the forces of Terrans, Protoss, and Zerg, I was busy fighting wars in the 41st Millennium, taking on foes ten times my greater and defeating them with honor and earning glory. This was also the version of Warhammer 40K's Dawn of War series that got me into modding, giving me a sweet, sweet taste of what the penultimate prize of Modding experience would be promised to me upon getting Soulstorm.If you've ever gotten the previous two, Dawn of War and Winter Assault, you'd know gameplay-wise that nothing's really changed. However, with the addition of two new factions; the popular Necrons and the mysteriuos Tau Empire; and new units for all other factions (including Grey Knights for the Blood Ravens, which remains my favorite unit choice to this day), it definitely shines in front of its predecessors. That, and with an awesome campaign where you can play not just one but all seven factions, promising continuous replayability even after you've beaten the campaign once...there's nothing here that's not to like.I'd be a fool not to recommend Dark Crusade. Any RTS player would be a fool to deny that this game stood the test of time. Stop reading the review, fork out some cash or grab that debit/credit card, and get the sodding game. The best part about it all is that the multiplayer options are compatible with all versions and are standalone, so you only need one game to have fun. I recommend giving it a go, it's worth it. Let's keep this game alive. For the Emperor			",151,3,2,6,15,0,16

												I Played this game, from release to now.Game has a wonderful array of units and armies which creates a unique universe to fight in. With 7 playable races and a million ways to play them you're not likely to run out of ways to kill stuff in this game. Best way to play the game is with 2 or 3 mates whilst in skype calls. You can really get involved in the competitiveness of base building and accumulating an army. Whether your making a turtle style base,crawling with turrets and snipers or rushing with bulky green aliens the game is fun at any stage of play from the first seconds to the 15 minutes where someone runs into your barely prepared base with an army of necrons.Campaign is just a series of skirmishes and leaves something to be desired in the area of voice acting and storyline, however it doesn't mean it's not fun. You can have fun in moving from battle to battle. The campaign is a solid The Game has a high degree of unit customization and army painting that makes your army unique to you, the more effort you put into the look of your army the more you can get behind it. Graphics are great and still hold after 9 years! pictures don't show just how good the game looks. All in all the game is in my opinion one of a kind and an unforgettable RTS experience. If RTS and army building is what gets you hard then this game will leave you with a raging erection. ",27,1,0,2,2,0,6

												This is not a game for those who want to build massive armies and bases. A small scale, short to medium length RTS with a decent amount of replayability and in-game options, it is not for everyone, and I would have bought other RTS games instead of this one if I had known.

												while the gameplay and the charactarisation of the original dawn of war are here there is no compelling story. the game plays out on a risk-like board. with RTS battles happening for all territories. every faction has a base that must be taken in order to win the campain. while these missions since they are more than simple bot matches (due to different objectives and conditons.) are interesting the rest is just filler. it would have been cooler if they'd just released those missions as a campain with a story regarding a few key characters from all the factions in the vain of the original game. if you loved the first one don't bother with this filler.

Mods were broken, the playerbase fractured even more...Don't buy.  It may be a good game, but supporting gamebreaking patches is not worth any cost.			",130,18,7,38,11,2,38

												Great game, don't get me wrong, but if you're buying this to unlock the races, don't. Apparently steam is no longer generating CD keys for this, Winter Assault, and Soulstorm. Meaning to use each race, you have to start it's respective game, and they don't link. the only one that works properly is the Dawn of War GOTY Edition. So in short, if you're only going to buy this, buy the GOTY because there's more races. You can only have one.			",85,4,0,4,4,0,6

Though quite outdated now, I wont reckonmend this game though, as you should get Dawn of War:Soulstorm instead, its not only better in many ways but their are more races and a mod called ""The Ultimate Apocolypse Mod"" that makes the game ten times better, go check it out.

												this series is great! ive spent many hours playing, and often loosing, and with the Ultimate appocolypse this game is spectacular. However SEGA and steam have conspired to kill this game by refusing to give out CDKEYS that are required for online play, and then ignoring the fact that the issue is happening and ignoring us trying to find a way to fix our beloved game. Do not buy this game! spend your hard earned money on a game you can actually play and on a company willing to let you play. May the GodEmperor Guide you			",12,2,1,10,18,0,33

												So this is like Dawn of War as a 4x game. There is map with provinces and you can choose where to attack. Sounds cool right? Well, the problem is that there is a reinforce mechanic. You basically buy units to protect a province and when the enemy attacks you, you start with those units. So the defender has a HUGE advantage. There is a counter to it but it doesn't really work. The attacker can start with units but you have to unlock them by conquering provinces...which you can't do because you don't have them yet!And then the enemy can reinforce like 3x more units than you can so you can't attack him and hope to win. And then for some dumb reason the computer gets 2 bases when he attacks you, but you only get 1 when you are the attacker. So there is a huge bias to the computer.Plus, necrons are OP because they get infinite free units.TL:DR computer has huge advantage, necrons OP			",67,21,0,24,2,0,15

												I've always been a huge fan of the 40K merchandise, with its' hulking soldiers, ridiculous explosions and basic, but very satisfying plotlines. This game is one of the best examples of  Warhammer at its' best.I recommend this game to everyone.			",18,3,0,3,3,0,11

												As a red alert veteran who played red alert on playstation 1 and couldnt understand wth is happening (I was like 6yrs old) who had all the expectations in strategies based on better versions of Dune, C&C and related I have never played any of the Warhammer merchandise ever and i had not a single idea about the chronology of the events or the series in general. All i knew about were the cool trailers that I saw in electronics shops on big TVs as demos... Never once I thought that I would rate any strategies on par with warcraft or red alert & similar but here I am to say that 40k is my new favourite strategy series. I got this in a bundle and started playing first. Worth every cent... however i would not suggest paying a full price for the original warhammer 40k even GOTY as it only had a single campaign of 11 missions by Blood Ravens(human race) only. Nevertheless fun but frankly speaking I`d rather pay same money to rule like 8 different races that must be commanded in 8 different ways (or more on your own preference) to conquer the entire planet. BUT HOWEVER!!!! If you are looking for a game like C&C where you can spam hundreds of units as long as you have the money and swarm the entire map with your units and enjoy the fact that you are not epileptic then im afraid that this game is a bummer... but if you simply want a GOOD well balanced and structured gameplay (although the story line presence is not that heavy in this game it is still a good one and makes sense) + good voice acting... Not the best graphics and unit design but present still... 8/10			",174,28,5,13,6,0,23

												Classic 40k gaming that surprisingly has not aged too badly. The graphics are a bit dated now but the gameplay is still good. Having the objective points and morale still makes this game interesting. All of hte 40k factions and the campaign map is pretty good too. Worth buying on the sales for an old school RTS that is still fun.			",75,11,1,23,11,1,44

												Classic RTS. Better than Starcraft. A little like company of heroes.Really cool atmosphere: warhammer is one of the best fantasy/sci-fi settings out there. Seven factions means a variety of play-styles. Harness the awesome technology of alien eldar, the sorcery of demons, and the dread of the necrons; or master the intricacies of the imperial guard through sweat, blood, artillery, and tank warfare. Not much of a strategist? Overwhelm your opponents with an Ork horde.  Fun campaign, great multiplayer, cool factions. If you're looking for some oldschool fun, this game will more than satisfy.

												this game is AMAZING, each race is very unique, and almost all of them have massive amounts of customization for each squad, and the animation is great, with brutal kills for melee units, and everything just looks good, the sound is also good, and there seems to be personality in the units with units yelling at their enemies, i just can't explain everything, but it's just good, so i recommend it very highly! all i need is some friends who also have it so we can kill stuff together FOR THE EMPRHAH!

You have multiple factions to choose from depending on your style of play.  Every time I play I have a different experience and outcome with each fight.  When ever I have the urge to play an RTS this is always the one i pick up and play.			",121,14,1,31,19,1,50

												If you are a fan of either the Warhammer 40K universe, or RTS games, or both, then this game is for you. Out of all the Dawn of War games (excluding Dawn of War 2), this one is hands down my favorite. I have sunk a LOT of hours into this game, and I'm only about a quarter of the way finished with it.Here's how the game plays: You pick a race (Space Marines, Chaos, Tau, Ethereal, Orks, Imperial Guard) at the start of the game. Each race has their own strengths and weaknesses. My personal favorite are the Space Marines, who are very versatile and can easily adapt to any situation. Once you pick a race, the game begins. It is set up like a board game, similar to Risk. Each race takes a turn, and on your turn you can choose where you want to move to. Where you choose determines what race you will fight in that area. Every territory also rewards you with Honor Guard, which are elite units (VERY powerful compared to your regular units). In addition to this, there are a couple territories that have special abilities, such as the Spaceport that lets you attack anywhere, or Forward Base which lets you start matches with some buildings already made. The game continues on like this, with you attacking and defending. Your commander unit also acquires War Gear as you play, which makes them even more powerful.The real combat of this game is in the attacking or defending phase. The game plays as standard RTS fare. You gather resources, build structures, and grow your army. There is a lot of variety within a single race, which really helps to mix up the gameplay. You take over resource points and fortify them as your forces clash with your opponent. Once your army is built up enough, then you can obliterate your opponent and win the territory. Two things are important to remember, though. First, the way you leave a territory is what you will come back to when you are defending it. If you fortify it heavily, then you will be hard to defeat when the battle comes back to that area. Secondly, the special territories all have unique battles. The Spaceport, for example, has you gathering special units scattered across the map. The first side to collect 6 of these wins.Graphics wise, this game is behind what you'd expect from a modern RTS game, but it gets the job done very well. The units are all very detailed, and pleasing to look at when you zoom the camera in. The only downside is that the terrain looks a little bland sometimes. However, this game is not about looking pretty, it's about the battles. And combat is really well done in this game. If you've played the other Dawn of War games, then you know how it goes. It's really cool to see the animations of units in combat, they don't just pummel each other until a health bar is gone, there is interaction between clashing forces.In addition to the campaign, there is a skirmish mode that you can play to your heart's content. If you and a buddy have this game, then you can also jump online and play against each other in online multiplayer. All in all, this is a great game. Don't let Steam fool you, I've been playing this long before I bought it on here, and my hours in it are easily 200+. I like replaying the game as the other races to see what I've missed. If you like Warhammer 40K or RTS games, this one's for you. If you aren't sure, then grab it if it goes on sale. Trust me, it's worth it.			",356,53,1,50,31,0,48

The Ai on the hardest difficultys is also up to scratch, especially if you turtle. You cannot turtle against the ai on this game. Overall great game.			",79,9,2,17,15,0,30

												The best RTS I've ever played is now even better. Dark Crusade was one of the best purchases I ever made on Steam. What is there to say other then it's Dawn of War but even better? The two new factions are just as unique and awesome as the original four, the battles are still fun to command and to watch with extremely fun animations and presentation. This isn't Age of Empires, you aren't controlling a community, you're commanding an army! THIS IS WAR!One of my favorite games on Steam, anyone who likes RTS games NEEDS to get this one, even if you are (like me) unfamiliar with Warhammer 40k.			",176,50,3,17,16,2,41

												in all honesty. i prefer dark crusade over all the warhammer games that have come out so far, sure the campains plot isnt much, but it is there, and its still good, in fact i rather enjoyed reading and listening to all the diffrent bases for the races. This game i give a 5/5, while i give the newer warhammer 40ks 4/5 (expete that other newer warhammer 40k gmae that has a similar layout to this, forgot what its called and im too lazy to look it up, but that only got 4.5/5, this is better in my opinion!)

												The best RTS I've ever played is now even better. Dark Crusade was one of the best purchases I ever made on Steam. What is there to say other then it's Dawn of War but even better? The two new factions are just as unique and awesome as the original four, the battles are still fun to command and to watch with extremely fun animations and presentation. This isn't Age of Empires, you aren't controlling a community, you're commanding an army! THIS IS WAR!One of my favorite games on Steam, anyone who likes RTS games NEEDS to get this one, even if you are (like me) unfamiliar with Warhammer 40k.			",176,50,3,17,16,2,41

												SO GOODLet me describe this gameso first off i played it on a different account for over 600 hours on record, i love the impereal guard the most badass race in the game, 2nd comes the Eldar if you learn how to master them, 3rd comes the space marines if your master the orbital strikes, 4th comes the tau if you know how to use the stealth teams and the fire warraiors  or however the hell its spelled, 5th comes the necrons very easy to use if you know hhow to use power and love to take risks, 6th are the orks using the squguith is so much fun to use SO MUCH FUN, 7th choas pretty much useless in my opinion.the game is very legit i totally recomend it, i love the game so god damn much i still cant stop playing it  and if you ever need help with the game im right here as a trainer, and remember ""FOR THE EMPORER!!!""

I have to say that Dark Crusade is one of the better versions of the game. Allowing most of the races that exist in the setting to take place in one game type is amazing. I totally give this game a 9/10 in my book ",84,17,1,29,50,0,66

												A stand-alone expansion for the Dawn of War series, Dark Crusade changes the games previously linear style by letting you play as any of the armies and fighting for control of a planet piece by piece. This game is definitely the best so far in the series and it provides many hours of replay value since the story is slightly different when you play through with each army. This is a must-play for fans of RTS games.			",271,66,5,32,18,5,62

												This game is an absolute must own for any warhammer 40k fan. It has plenty of cutscenes from intros to outros and opening cutscene for a faction and one for defeating them. The game has simple controls to where even a first time RTS player like myself can get into it. The map interface is easy to use and planet resources are the only key winning on harder difficulties. The best part of the game is playing as the iconic factions of the warhammer 40k universe and some play very differently than others I would recommend playing as the Space Marines or Chaos factions first. The only problem i've faced with the game is a bug that let load a saved data for the Ork faction after i exit the game.			",53,2,0,5,1,0,28

Note: This review used to be ""Not Recommended"" because there was a keygen issue which kept many people, myself included, locked out of multiplayer if we wanted to play as certain races. Relic has resolved the issue - I have not tested this myself but it appears to have worked for the community. As such, the new review reflects this change. Won't speak for multiplayer because I don't play it, but it does appear to work now. Game will be easy or hard depending on your skill level and the faction you play against. Here's why - Combat boils down to two different kinds - melee and ranged. Most factions will in general prefer one over the other, the exception being the Space Marines who are Jacks-of-all-trades. As such, if one faction prefers one kind they will naturally be weak at another. For example, I prefer the Imperial Guard, who use ranged units almost exclusively. As such, if I can't keep, say, the Orcs, or especially the Necrons at a distance, my men in their weak armor will get chewed up and spat out. If I can hold them back however, they'll find themselves unable to survive the continual barrage of artillery, autocannon fire, lascannon volleys, and tank shells :D the key, for the IG, is to keep them away. It works differently for each faction. Know your strengths and weaknesses and the day can be yours!10/10 would let Chaos burn the much-hated Necrons to the ground so I can win the game faster again.			",122,12,0,12,23,1,50

												A really fun RTS that gives you the full experience of Warhammer. It is an enjoyable game that I recommend to everyone who enjoys playing RTS games. It is not without it's ""faults"", however. One major irk I have with the game is that the intro is very long and cannot be skipped, nor can the credits. If these things could be skipped it would make the game a little better, as you would be able to jump straight into it. The price is also a little high, but if you want a really good science-fantasy RTS, then this is the game for you.			",74,5,2,6,5,0,1

												TL;DR:While I will say that I like Dark Crusade more than Winter Assault in terms of the overall fun I had with it, it was not without its flaws. The combat is relentless and forces you to think and react quickly and appropriately, and I enjoyed the feeling of conquering a world through the different skirmishes. Yet, even continuous winning can become a huge slog of tedium that will wear anyone down over time. I'm fairly certain this took longer to complete than the original Dawn of War and Winter Assault combined, and since the final expansion pack, Soulstorm, is the exact-same gameplay as Dark Crusade, with two new armies I don't care about, I won't be playing that any time soon either.Want to read the full review?

												This game is probrably the best RTS game ever.  With nine factions.  With completely seperate units, the developers took quite the amount of time and effort and it came out fantastic.  Rather simple to get the basics, but goes alot more in depth.  The campaign is amazing.  I mean come on.  Has there ever been a single RTS game where your mission is to rule a planet.  It sounds crazy and mediocre and boring, but the prologue makes sense.  Extremely time consuming with exciting fights against all other 8 factions.  Conquering their HQ won't be easy either.  You're up against a boss and waves and waves of coming units within the first minute of the turn.  And yes you take turns attacking and defending with a global view of the map.  You can have units defend territories or take them with you using requisition.  Upgrades are also availabe for your commander to get stronger and cooler.  It's finally suprising how the multiplayer for a game made in 2006 is still functioning!  The multiplayer with friends is a blast.  Use your strenths as different factions to either fight AI or other actual people!  In conclusion this game once again is one of the best RTS games i've seen.  Enough for me to buy 5 copies for my friends.  The price is also cheap and cheaper on sales.  Highly recommend!			",89,7,0,5,7,0,9

												Easily the best expansion of dow. The campaign has loads of replayability, each races story is unique and in line with their 40k personas, and each plays so differently.

												Decent Old school RTS.Word of warning though because of the way the campaign works, with enemies starting with twice the bases and 5 times  the starting army  and a much greater economy (Even with Defenders advantages), even normal mode is very difficult. Micro is basically impossible since the unit controls are buggy, (Protip, try and separate infantry from tanks, otherwise they will get stuck on each other). Attack Move command spreads out your units across the map for some reason, andit is not uncommon for groups of units to bug out and refuse to move when going through a chockepoint.  7.5/10			",95,2,1,13,5,0,18

												Out of all the original dawn of war games, this is my favorite.  Something very simple makes this particular game stand out: fortifying individual areas on the strategic map.  Comparing this to Soulstorm, as they are similar, Dark Crusade eliminates some of the tiresome defenses you run into with Soulstorm.  Constantly fighting over a single piece of land gets old when you start every defense with one building and a servitor.  Compare that with DC starting you with everything but the units you ended the last tactical battle with.  Something small, but it made a big difference to me and kept me coming back.  I also highly recommend Titanium Wars for a mod as it adds tons to the game.			",109,0,0,8,2,0,18

												This game is an absolute must own for any warhammer 40k fan. It has plenty of cutscenes from intros to outros and opening cutscene for a faction and one for defeating them. The game has simple controls to where even a first time RTS player like myself can get into it. The map interface is easy to use and planet resources are the only key winning on harder difficulties. The best part of the game is playing as the iconic factions of the warhammer 40k universe and some play very differently than others I would recommend playing as the Space Marines or Chaos factions first. The only problem i've faced with the game is a bug that let load a saved data for the Ork faction after i exit the game.			",53,2,0,5,1,0,28

												Oh dear god i've lost too many hours to this game.This is proabley my favorite use of the 40k license to date.  its an expansion to dawn of war but it plays like a grand strategy game.  choose a race conqure territores, upgrade your warlord wash rinse repeat.  all of the races have there own play styles and while most of the skermishes play out in similar fashion. its the stronghold level of each race that really makes the game good.  each race has a last stand scenario that you have get through and they feel very different from one another and will force you to use different tactics to survive.i've never spent so much time on an RTS before. i don't know if its the setting or what but this game just clicks with me.

												The original Dawn of War series up to and including this one is awesome. It's a different spin on the RTS type of game. It's hard to turtle since you need to capture territory to get more resources. If you do turtle, you'll fall behind quickly. Anyway, they get rid of some of the annoying micro management and instead its about your units and taking and destroying stuff. Several different races to play. Great game and fantastic multiplayer.			",149,19,1,39,11,1,31

												DOW 40K: Dark Crusade is a really good RTS with a lot of variety depending on which faction you are playing - with the adding of the Tau and the Necrons it gives you even more weapons in your hand to decimate your opponents with. Although there are a few balancing issues, the gameplay is very good. And the online multiplayer is back and alive after SEGA took over.In short, if you want a good RTS to play with or against your friends or the AI - get Dawn of War.			",720,196,26,109,67,7,141

												A stand-alone expansion for the Dawn of War series, Dark Crusade changes the games previously linear style by letting you play as any of the armies and fighting for control of a planet piece by piece. This game is definitely the best so far in the series and it provides many hours of replay value since the story is slightly different when you play through with each army. This is a must-play for fans of RTS games.			",271,66,5,32,18,5,62

												So I've been playing Dawn of War for a long time. I even read the books and play the miniature game outside of the digital world. But in all. I have to say that Dark Crusade is one of the better versions of the game. Allowing most of the races that exist in the setting to take place in one game type is amazing. I totally give this game a 9/10 in my book ",84,17,1,29,50,0,66

												This is still my favourite RTS. I keep coming back to Dawn of War. I prefer the campaign node of Dark Crusade (keep buildings) and the armies of Soulstorm (Sisters) so I flip back and forth between these two where I want to relax into a good skirmish or putter away at campaigns for planetary and system domiance.Even if you weren't already familiar (or even fond of) GW's Warhammer franchises the richness of the story and the faction backgrounds really help make the RTS that much more fun. The factions play very differently but are still pretty balanced.Although this game is old the graphics look fine and it handles large monitors well, compared to many other older titles.

												I've been a huge fan of Warhammer 40k for about 7 years now. Not just for the Dawn of War games, but for the lore in general as well. Being a huge fan of warfare, sci-fi, and military related things, no other sci-fi game, movie, or novel has fascinated me more than Warhammer 40k, mostly because no other sci-fi has gone the same lengths, nor can even be compared to Warhammer 40k. (Star Craft, Halo, Star Wars, not even Marvel or DC can compare to it!) If you're a die-hard Warhammer 40k fan like me, or just someone who loves to play RTS games in general, I'd highly recommend adding this game to your library. You won't regret it. For a game that first came out in 2004, (though Dark Crusade came out in 2006) no other RTS is as bloody, gorey, or addicting as Dawn of War Dark Crusade and is still fun as hell to play to this day! Buy now and see just intense the 41st millenium can be!			",63,1,0,3,6,0,6

												If there was ever an RTS that's insanely addictive, this is it! It's very well polished, has a great tutorial and is very well balanced.What makes the game a real winner is that it's easy to play, but hard to master. Camera manipulation, map scrolling, location bookmarking, building, recruiting, resource management, unit selection, unit grouping and unit direction feel very natural and logical and have been very well implemented. This is often something that is done so poorly in many RTS's and ruins what would have otherwise been a good game, but DOW makes it easy, which means that I can crack on with the more complicated management of my bases, armies and resource gathering.I also love the element where you take a bit with you at the end of each mission to the next mission because that makes logical sense if you're running a war campaign, instead of starting each new mission with 1 builder unit.One thing that can be improved is troop path finding, including formations. Then again, I still haven't found and RTS that does this overly well and I just have to micro-manage my armies more like usual.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've been a huge fan of Warhammer 40k for about 7 years now. Not just for the Dawn of War games, but for the lore in general as well. Being a huge fan of warfare, sci-fi, and military related things, no other sci-fi game, movie, or novel has fascinated me more than Warhammer 40k, mostly because no other sci-fi has gone the same lengths, nor can even be compared to Warhammer 40k. (Star Craft, Halo, Star Wars, not even Marvel or DC can compare to it!) If you're a die-hard Warhammer 40k fan like me, or just someone who loves to play RTS games in general, I'd highly recommend adding this game to your library. You won't regret it. For a game that first came out in 2004, (though Dark Crusade came out in 2006) no other RTS is as bloody, gorey, or addicting as Dawn of War Dark Crusade and is still fun as hell to play to this day! Buy now and see just intense the 41st millenium can be!			",63,1,0,3,6,0,6

												Best RTS I have ever played! When I first saw this game my friend was playing, I began taking interest and brought for myself. After loosing countless of battles in Normal Mode, I finally knew how to play the game and spent hundreds of hours on it (its not on my hours record cause I played on non-steam CD game). However, sadly, My old pc broke and lost the game. Some how when I found out steam, I found this game and brought it again! Hours of fun casual game against bots (even if there is not much players on multiplayer!). The Campaign is superb and I definately recommend buying it and keeping it in your Library as you might play it from time to time!			",76,9,6,7,5,0,9

												The original Dawn of War series up to and including this one is awesome. It's a different spin on the RTS type of game. It's hard to turtle since you need to capture territory to get more resources. If you do turtle, you'll fall behind quickly. Anyway, they get rid of some of the annoying micro management and instead its about your units and taking and destroying stuff. Several different races to play. Great game and fantastic multiplayer.			",149,19,1,39,11,1,31

												A stand-alone expansion for the Dawn of War series, Dark Crusade changes the games previously linear style by letting you play as any of the armies and fighting for control of a planet piece by piece. This game is definitely the best so far in the series and it provides many hours of replay value since the story is slightly different when you play through with each army. This is a must-play for fans of RTS games.			",271,66,5,32,18,5,62

												DOW 40K: Dark Crusade is a really good RTS with a lot of variety depending on which faction you are playing - with the adding of the Tau and the Necrons it gives you even more weapons in your hand to decimate your opponents with. Although there are a few balancing issues, the gameplay is very good. And the online multiplayer is back and alive after SEGA took over.In short, if you want a good RTS to play with or against your friends or the AI - get Dawn of War.			",720,196,26,109,67,7,141

												Dark Crusade is by far the best expansion pack for Warhammer 40,000 Dawn of War. First off it's a stand alone expansion pack so you don't need Dawn of War or Dawn of War Winter Assualt to play it. It adds two new factions that make the total number of playable factions up to 7 in the game. The new factions add more variety to an already great RTS game. The campaign has also been completely rehauled for Dark Crusade and it definitely benefits from it. The new Risk-like campaign allows you to play with all 7 of the factions on a world map where you managed your territories and then move your army to battle the other factions in the standard Dawn of War RTS battles. There are also many small new features Dark Crusade has like how the factions in the previous Dawn of War games got new units. In the end Dark Crusade expands on what made Dawn of War an excellent RTS game and will forever make Dark Crusade one of my favorite RTS games. If you enjoy Relic Entertainment's other RTS games like Company of Heroes then you'll definitely enjoy the gameplay of Dark Crusade. Fans of the RTS genre should definitely give this game a go as well as fans of the Warhammer 40k universe.			",90,2,0,6,7,0,30

												I love this game, in my opinion of of th Best RTS Games ever made, (for the record I have not played Soulstorm) although I now might after discovering the Ultimate Apocalypse Mod.  Is it perfect? no.  Is it completely balanced in multiplayer? no.  what it is, is fun as hell and very satisfying to play. Dark Crusafe adds a twist to the campaign modes.  Rather than following a linear path of objectives like the previous DOW and Winter assault, it throws in a Meta game where you are fighting for complete control of a Planet, which throws in tactical decisions on where to buy more support for the territory you just won or to bolster an earlier victory site.  I could go on for hours, but I will simply conclude with this, if you are a fan of warhammer 40k, or just love a satisfying base building push and pull RTS, this is a game that must have a spot in your library, you are guaranteed hours of fun!

												This game is a delightful mix of the classic setup of Risk, a dash of RTS management, and the ultra violent world of Warhammer 40K. Each faction has their own storyline and customizable leader thus providing hours of replayable mayhem. The game can start to feel repetitive at times, especially when the computer decides to attack your controlled zones several times over, but if you feel up to it, you can skip the actual battle and have the outcome decided by a traditional ""dice roll"" if you will, though I highly recommend taking firsthand control for every battle. It is by no means a total encompassment of all things Warhammer and seems to favor infantry units over vehicles, but all in all this game is highly enjoyable and should be a part of any Warhammer fan's library. FOR THE EMPEROR!			",80,13,0,13,10,0,21

												The Dark Crusade is considered the starting point in my campaign with the Warhammer series probably back in 2007. I always come back to this game year after year because I enjoy the single player and multiplayer game modes that include all the races unlocked out of the gate. The single player mode allows you to pick any race and drops you on the map with the rest of the races scattered across the globe. Each section of the map you win provides requisition and other bonuses to your army. The turn based ""Risk style"" mode begins after your first action and then allows each AI a turn in capturing territories. Similar to other RTS games, Dark Crusade is no different and allows you to construct buildings, vehicles and troops. The maps in each territory are littered with capture points that you will need to grab before your opponent in order to gain resources to expand your base. While there isn't much story in the campaign beyond the first introduction scene, more details will unfold as you begin to win battles against the other opponents when you capture their strongholds. The main character for each race is also outfitted with war gear as you fulfill certain requirements throughout Dark Crusade. Once you start conquering section of the map, rest assured that each race will take opportunites to invade and try to force you out of the territory. If I could recommend an RTS game then this would be the one out of all the Warhammer games. Whether it is a group of vehicles bombarding soldiers sending them flying or the up close action of Blood Ravens putting the boots to Orks for the Emperor, I feel there is never a dull moment in battle. I think Dark Crusade is the definitive pick over the newer Dawn of War games because of the maps, large scale battles and the non-linear campaign. Your best bet is to pick up the Warhammer collection, which usually pops up on sale. I had hours of time on Dark Crusade when I owned the original disc but had to purchase it again because I lost them.			",159,14,2,18,1,1,13

												Warhammer 40k Dark Crusade is the 3rd entry into the Dawn of War series and its a strong contender in the RTS market despite not being as mainstream as the Starcraft or Stronghold series. If you enjoy games like Company of Heroes and Starcraft then this is a can't miss title.The game is set on the planet Kronus where the Imperial Guard rule in the name of the Emperor but all is not well on Kronus. The Ork invasion has begun anew on this planet and with all the fighting above the ancient killing machines known as the Necron have awaken which in turn has caused the Tau to appear on the planet in an effort to stop them from annihilating all life on the planet. Of course all this extra violence has attracted the attention of the Blood God of Chaos attention and brought the Chaos Marines onto Kronus. And with the Chaos Marines the Eldar quickly came in tow to stop them from ressurecting more demons and overtaking more planets. The Space Marines (namely the Blood Ravens) are ordered to cleanse the planet now for it is considered overrun with the Alien, the Unclean, and the Heretic. Upon their arrival on the planet they are told their are precious artifacts on Kronus that must be reclaimed at all costs and thus order the Imperial Guard to evacuate from Kronus in order for them to purge Kronus and reclaim the artifacts. The Guard promptly refuses and sparks an intense war with the Blood Ravens. This all quickly turns into a nasty open war.How this war plays out however is solely up to you however. The game gives you a decent background for each race and the events leading to the war but it has not true canon story beyond that. Your campaign mode consists of picking 1 of several races (Space Marines, Imperial Guard, Eldar, Orks, Chaos Marines, Tau, or Necrons) and then using them to conquer the entire map. The campaign starts off on the world screen where you can reinforce your territories launch attacks or upgrade your Honor Guard, which are essentially free beefed up versions of your basic units, as well as upgrade your commander unit with Wargear, items that add health attack or other bonus abilities to your commander unit. Each race has its own Stronghold which if taken will kick them from the game for that campaign. Capture all strongholds to win.All in all the game looks great despite some age, it sounds great and has a decent soundtrack and its positively steeped in lore for every race. Theres dozens of novels written on this series. I highly recommend this game to any and all fans of RTS games. Gotta cut this one short since Steam wont let me write any more about this game!

												As far as Warhammer games go, this one is at the top. It balances the campaigns and skirmishes better than Soulstorm. Necrons and Tau are forces to be reckoned with. 9/10Pros:Fun, fast-paced combatCustomizeable leaders and you can pick your honor guard.Just enough depth for both casual gamers and hardcore fans to enjoy.Cons:Some of the voice acting, especially for the Chaos builder units, is incredibly annoying. Most are OK, but quite a few of the soundbites get said so often it really makes you want to give a blood sacrifice to Khorne. But hey, Blood for the Blood God, ya know? Battles tend to get out of hand, with an intense amount of juggling to keep things going (especially with the flimsy Imperials).			",73,16,1,13,14,1,27

												This game is damn goodthat's all I can really say. It's an enjoyable, challenging RTS with some well fleshed out factions to pick from. Some are similar and some are totally different, all that's certain is that you'll be throwing their units at the enemy units in a desperate scramble to win. It's fun, it's exhilirating and it doesn't♥♥♥♥♥♥all over the 40k franchise. What more could you ask for?**(maybe a preview copy of Dawn of War 3)			",75,5,0,10,8,0,20

												I recommend this game to gamers who love strategy games because this game containes great gameplay, 7 different armies to play with and customise colour schemes for different legions.this game has A turn based campaign where you choose one alien or human race and take over the planet, this is great to do because you can try different armies out and see what one you play with best and you can watch cutscences for differnt races.If you want to improve your skills you can play skirmish mode where you can create your own scenarios  to your liking which is fun to do and there are endless possibilities  so you wont get bored.And last of all there is an online feature where you can challenge other players in the warhammer comunity to a great battle to see which race is the best in battle, you can also invite friends to lobbys and have up to 8 people in one game.I personally give this game an 8 out of 10 for epic large size battes but the only thing it lacks in are graphics and it might lagg if the battle is too big so people can disconnect from the online game alot.

												in all honesty. i prefer dark crusade over all the warhammer games that have come out so far, sure the campains plot isnt much, but it is there, and its still good, in fact i rather enjoyed reading and listening to all the diffrent bases for the races. This game i give a 5/5, while i give the newer warhammer 40ks 4/5 (expete that other newer warhammer 40k gmae that has a similar layout to this, forgot what its called and im too lazy to look it up, but that only got 4.5/5, this is better in my opinion!)

												Main selling point? Second greatest RTS campaign ever (Only surpassed by Starcraft 2: Wings of liberty IMHO).It's basically risk, only with fun battles instead of dice rolls! Heck even some of the special maps are crafted with care that a campaign mission would be (Try eldar and invade the ork stronghold, Farseer Taldeer and Warboss Golgutz will go at it!).Oh yeah, Tau and necron are stupid fun armies as well!Mind you this is an X-Pack, while it is playable as a standalone, if you want to play all the armies you'll need the base Dawn of War, and Winter Assault, otherwise you'll just be stuck as Tau and Necron.

This game might even get you interested in the Warhammer universe! The campaign is fantastically designed, I won't spoil it for you, but you will like it for sure. Of course, this is a pure RTS game with a lot of content and it is not really that easy to master. Anyways, GET THIS.			",171,24,3,23,16,0,31

												The Dark Crusade is considered the starting point in my campaign with the Warhammer series probably back in 2007. I always come back to this game year after year because I enjoy the single player and multiplayer game modes that include all the races unlocked out of the gate. The single player mode allows you to pick any race and drops you on the map with the rest of the races scattered across the globe. Each section of the map you win provides requisition and other bonuses to your army. The turn based ""Risk style"" mode begins after your first action and then allows each AI a turn in capturing territories. Similar to other RTS games, Dark Crusade is no different and allows you to construct buildings, vehicles and troops. The maps in each territory are littered with capture points that you will need to grab before your opponent in order to gain resources to expand your base. While there isn't much story in the campaign beyond the first introduction scene, more details will unfold as you begin to win battles against the other opponents when you capture their strongholds. The main character for each race is also outfitted with war gear as you fulfill certain requirements throughout Dark Crusade. Once you start conquering section of the map, rest assured that each race will take opportunites to invade and try to force you out of the territory. If I could recommend an RTS game then this would be the one out of all the Warhammer games. Whether it is a group of vehicles bombarding soldiers sending them flying or the up close action of Blood Ravens putting the boots to Orks for the Emperor, I feel there is never a dull moment in battle. I think Dark Crusade is the definitive pick over the newer Dawn of War games because of the maps, large scale battles and the non-linear campaign. Your best bet is to pick up the Warhammer collection, which usually pops up on sale. I had hours of time on Dark Crusade when I owned the original disc but had to purchase it again because I lost them.			",159,14,2,18,1,1,13

												Among all 4 games in the Dawn of War 1 series, I think Dark Crusade is the best. Apart from the high production values that Relic have already implementend in previous entries, they have outdone themselves with this game: Seven playable races, a campaign that resembles the tabletop game a bit more and is very fun and chaotic, and memorable interactions with the various commanders in the story. Of course, not everything is good: balance is pretty bad, as Necrons, Eldar and Tau dominate all other races; also the campaign can sometimes be unfair. However, in the end, Dark Crusade is still one of the best RTS games of the 2000's and it is highly enjoyable to pick uo and play. ",13,3,0,2,1,0,3

												What do you get when you mix war movies with RTS games?! Look avobe you! This game has very neat quick paced action, and it has very neat animations! Often you can rotate your camera and zoom in on the action as you watch your units fight face to face against the enemy and the fast pace of the game makes this one hell of a ride!BUT if you want to play against other playes. Good luck finding someone to invite you in or someone to join your custom match. Also the AI to me seems very off balance. On easy mode it can be quite easy to win and on Hard mode it REALLY mean hard! Sometimes it feels like the AI is cheating.With or without it's flaws, this game will keep you entertained for hours to come!			",52,5,0,8,3,0,6

												Don't get the meager hours I have on steam get to you, I've played the everloving sh*t out of dark crusade since I was like 12 (probs about 8yrs ago ~ 2007) and I can't play any other RTS, nothing compares in my opinion. It's simple gameplay wise in standard battles (i.e.- destoy all HQs, capture relics/points) but there's depth in each race which can aid in battle and equally be countered by enemies with the right units (e.g.- infiltration units can only be detected by certain enemy units differing between race). Survival with some races at higher difficulty, especially with Imp guard requires utilising the terrain to your advantage, the large units will be mowed down quick by say Necron or Space Marines but in heavy cover they rek everything. You gain power and resources from generators/slag deposits and from capturing points, building good defenses at these can really turn the tide if you're outnumbered, if you can hide a second HQ it'll give you a good chance at surviving a full onslaught if need be (won't be necessary in single player unless crazy difficulty and high level land. Each race of course has different buildings and path progressions, you upgrade HQs to get more units/capacity, the necrons can upgrade it so it can move which is neato. When eliminating a race from the game missions get a lot more interesting, for example Chaos marines have a blood purge which will kill all in a certain area every 80s, which will either require fast units to move across quickly to halt the purge allowing vehicles/slow units through. Again this can be counteracted with certain portaling races like the Eldar but I ♥♥♥♥ing hate the Eldar they suck balls. Anyway most elimination missions are challenging, long and fun as hell. Graphics- I mean it came out like 10yrs ago, I play it on my laptop with everything jacked up (Lenovo flex pro 2) but as long as you have a screen and a potato it should run at 60fps. Saying that the death splatters are pretty gruesome and generally it still looks pretty cool. You can also customise the look of races, which can be handy if you're like me and blind as f*ck, it's pretty easy to miss smaller units when everythings green but make them bright pink with blue trim and they look fabulous. Sound- Decent, cutscene stuff sounds a bit Matt Damon and the Imperial Guard's commandant voice actor must be in league with Tommy Wiseau but shooty stuff sounds fine, explosions a bit weird but again >2006Overall: just buy it, the second DoW takes out all the buildy stuff which some like but I hate, so if you're more into just unit tictacs over building 'management' get the second as well but I'd say this is the most bang for your buck RTS you can get, I've played it more than the original DoW ",315,60,8,30,41,0,28

												I have been a massive fan of the Warhammer 40,000 universe for 11 years now, so when I picked up Dow Dark Crusade I was excited! And trust me this game does not disappoint! Whether you're looking for a fun 40k game or an exciting RTS this game is perfect, with an innovative style of play (capturing control points rather than harvesting minerals) and a great amount of detail towards the 40k setting! Would reccommend this game to everyone and their cat 10/10!			",7,2,0,4,1,0,14

												Warhammer 40k Dark Crusade is the 3rd entry into the Dawn of War series and its a strong contender in the RTS market despite not being as mainstream as the Starcraft or Stronghold series. If you enjoy games like Company of Heroes and Starcraft then this is a can't miss title.The game is set on the planet Kronus where the Imperial Guard rule in the name of the Emperor but all is not well on Kronus. The Ork invasion has begun anew on this planet and with all the fighting above the ancient killing machines known as the Necron have awaken which in turn has caused the Tau to appear on the planet in an effort to stop them from annihilating all life on the planet. Of course all this extra violence has attracted the attention of the Blood God of Chaos attention and brought the Chaos Marines onto Kronus. And with the Chaos Marines the Eldar quickly came in tow to stop them from ressurecting more demons and overtaking more planets. The Space Marines (namely the Blood Ravens) are ordered to cleanse the planet now for it is considered overrun with the Alien, the Unclean, and the Heretic. Upon their arrival on the planet they are told their are precious artifacts on Kronus that must be reclaimed at all costs and thus order the Imperial Guard to evacuate from Kronus in order for them to purge Kronus and reclaim the artifacts. The Guard promptly refuses and sparks an intense war with the Blood Ravens. This all quickly turns into a nasty open war.How this war plays out however is solely up to you however. The game gives you a decent background for each race and the events leading to the war but it has not true canon story beyond that. Your campaign mode consists of picking 1 of several races (Space Marines, Imperial Guard, Eldar, Orks, Chaos Marines, Tau, or Necrons) and then using them to conquer the entire map. The campaign starts off on the world screen where you can reinforce your territories launch attacks or upgrade your Honor Guard, which are essentially free beefed up versions of your basic units, as well as upgrade your commander unit with Wargear, items that add health attack or other bonus abilities to your commander unit. Each race has its own Stronghold which if taken will kick them from the game for that campaign. Capture all strongholds to win.All in all the game looks great despite some age, it sounds great and has a decent soundtrack and its positively steeped in lore for every race. Theres dozens of novels written on this series. I highly recommend this game to any and all fans of RTS games. Gotta cut this one short since Steam wont let me write any more about this game! For the Emperor!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is what Dawn of War should be. Balls-to-the-wall RTS, with each of the seven races being strong and weak in their own ways. You think having a Necron army makes you unstoppable ? Try assaulting the Eldar base on Hard difficulty. Think the imperial guard is no match for your Tau battlesuits? Try taking their stronghold and coming face to face with a Titan cannon and Baneblades kicking the crap out of you. But I digress. Winter Assault and Dark Crusade made me love God of War. I'll be finishing the game with all seven races. Wait for a sale and pick it up. You won't be able to put it down. For the Emperor !			",52,9,1,5,0,0,8

												This game is probrably the best RTS game ever.  With nine factions.  With completely seperate units, the developers took quite the amount of time and effort and it came out fantastic.  Rather simple to get the basics, but goes alot more in depth.  The campaign is amazing.  I mean come on.  Has there ever been a single RTS game where your mission is to rule a planet.  It sounds crazy and mediocre and boring, but the prologue makes sense.  Extremely time consuming with exciting fights against all other 8 factions.  Conquering their HQ won't be easy either.  You're up against a boss and waves and waves of coming units within the first minute of the turn.  And yes you take turns attacking and defending with a global view of the map.  You can have units defend territories or take them with you using requisition.  Upgrades are also availabe for your commander to get stronger and cooler.  It's finally suprising how the multiplayer for a game made in 2006 is still functioning!  The multiplayer with friends is a blast.  Use your strenths as different factions to either fight AI or other actual people!  In conclusion this game once again is one of the best RTS games i've seen.  Enough for me to buy 5 copies for my friends.  The price is also cheap and cheaper on sales.  Highly recommend!			",89,7,0,5,7,0,9

												10/10 - This is one of the best Warhammer titles there is out there, even to this day. The graphics haven't aged well, but it is still a amazing piece of work. I would easily buy this over any other Warhammer title to this day. It has serveral different story lines that are fairly different from each other, gameplay is fluid/simple, and artstyle is on point. If you want to get into the Warhammer 40K series, hands down this is the game to do get you into it.			",153,12,3,21,10,0,15

												What can i say about Dawn of War that hasn't already been said better since it's creation?Nothing, i wager.Dawn of War: Dark Crusade may be the best of the original 4 Dawn of War titles with regards to overall content. Soulstorm may have more races to play as, but despite the addition of my favorite faction, the Sisters of Battle, its shortcomings in its campaign mode and overall stability compared to Dark Crusade leave something to be desired even for me. it doesn't have the direct story of winter assault or the original dawn of war title, either.but what it does have is brutality in spades, the awesome voice acting and effective music of Winter Assault and Dawn of War, and it was the first of the series to have what amounts to a campaign game akin to a game of Risk, where you must take and hold territory and through that, become strong enough to siege each other race off the map.nothing prepared me for the joy i had as my Necron force, wishing the annihilation of all life, stomped into Warboss Gorgutz 'ead 'unters stronghold, and the banter and quickly. WAAAAAAAAAGGGGGHHHHH began. i was literally blown away by what the Imperial Guard brought to the table.Something bout all this. it just feels oh so good.			",122,17,0,19,14,3,23

												I've only one word to describe this game: EPIC. My playthrough as the T'au was, lets say, the best experience I have had in many years of playing games. This game, especially the final stronghold of the game, is hard as ****! My stronghold might have been different from others, but HOLY CRAP! I spend 4 hours trying to get everything right. Setback after setback, I was thankfully successful. Play this on the hardest difficulty and you will have a lot of fun.			",55,12,0,16,7,0,27

												I got this Christmas 2015 while it was about five dollars and will never regret its purchase, I assure you.Super addictive and pretty well balanced yet challenging enough, with multiple different strategies and playstyles to keep it interesting. This is an old game but it's definitely worth the $13+ to get them all on sale. **Please note you can only play all of the races if you buy all the expansion games.10/10 would PURGE again.

												love the new two classes. The game plays better than the first game but lack in story line. you can play the game over and over again with out getting bord. Tatic and strategy are needed in the campaign in the  beginning. The campaign is not hard but the there is a dificulty gap in the Easy, Normal, And Hard mode. The graphic got better  and the two classes are very strong and i am not saying that the others are not. The tao are very good shooters and the necrons are slow but so hard to kill.

												A really fun RTS that gives you the full experience of Warhammer. It is an enjoyable game that I recommend to everyone who enjoys playing RTS games. It is not without it's ""faults"", however. One major irk I have with the game is that the intro is very long and cannot be skipped, nor can the credits. If these things could be skipped it would make the game a little better, as you would be able to jump straight into it. The price is also a little high, but if you want a really good science-fantasy RTS, then this is the game for you.			",74,5,2,6,5,0,1

												DOW 40K: Dark Crusade is a really good RTS with a lot of variety depending on which faction you are playing - with the adding of the Tau and the Necrons it gives you even more weapons in your hand to decimate your opponents with. Although there are a few balancing issues, the gameplay is very good. And the online multiplayer is back and alive after SEGA took over.In short, if you want a good RTS to play with or against your friends or the AI - get Dawn of War.			",720,196,26,109,67,7,141
