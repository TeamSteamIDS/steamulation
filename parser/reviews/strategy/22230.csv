												Rock of ages is a game about rolling down a hill; to squish a little man, literally. In Rock of Ages, there is a very minor story, hardly relating to the game. This isnt a bad thing because the game doesn't need a story to be enjoyed, however the story is humorous. The core gameplay aspect of Rock of Ages is rolling your rock down a slope riddled with defences in order to smash down an enemy gate. The opponents, are not only people from history, also attack your gate and the player must build their own defences in order to slow down or stop the other rock. You gain in game gold in order to pay for defences, and to upgrade your rock. The defences range from towers, elephants, catapults and even bombs. These are used to slow down the enemy rock, if enough damage is done to the rock, it shrinks, dealing less damage. The upgrades for your rock are simple, adding metal spikes or lighting your rock on fire, dealing extra damage. Damage is also decided by the speed of the rock when it collides with the door; the faster the rock, the harder it hits.Rock of ages also has a few mini games, one of which is skeeball. Rock of ages also has trading cards, and very easy achievements, making the game apply to a larger audience. Rock of Ages does things rightIts story is humorousThe gameplay is overall enjoyableEasy 100% achievementsThe co-op is good fun with friendsThe mini games are mostly funThe in game destruction looks goodIts overall very originalRock of ages does some things wrongIt can be repetitive Slightly boring to some older gamersThe Defences aren't overly effectiveThe respawn locations can really mess with the playerLacks real substanceOverall rock of ages isn't bad, it's just basic. The $10.99(CAD) price tag is way too high unless the player is planning to 100% it. Its a fun game to play with friends, however. It also makes the game lots more fun. ",400,61,6,26,50,1,63

												This game is like someone threw Monty Python, Tower Defence, and Marble Madness in a blender, turned it on high for a few minutes, arranged it into a delicious dessert, and sprinkled some history on top for flavor enhancement. Honestly, how can you go wrong with a game in which you control a gigantic boulder (of varying shapes and sizes - I must say the fist is my favorite), and use it to shatter your opponent's gate? Even better, you get to squash their defenseless, flailing forms immediately afterwards to an immensely satisfying whoopie cushion sound. If that is not enough to satisfy, there are also trained war bovines, elephants, and mammoths for you to use and abuse in the defense of your fortress. There are also elephant-launching airships..  If you are like me, you may derive much more pleasure from their strategic placement to troll your enemies, whether they be human players (yes, this game has online multiplayer) or historical figureheads. Highly Recommend for some hard core laughter.			",59,17,0,8,6,0,0

												Oh man, this game is great! You see, Rock of Ages is actually an accurate historical representation of medieval warfare. Instead of having men, women and children slaughter each other mindlessly over some petty argument, disputes were settled by using sentient boulders. Yes, rocks. As this round stone, you travel through the ages of classical art (t)rolling and smashing everything on your way! Just remember though, you are not alone. Just as it happens, the enemy team has sent away a boulder of their own, and you have to race down with them! Whoever splats (oh god I love that sound) the enemy general, wins.All in all, hilarious visuals and sounds, fun gameplay, some surprisingly complex base defense features and absolutely fantastic multiplayer modes, together make this game a must buy. This game has the Pidgin's Feather Seal of Approval, 5/5 would poop on.			",321,53,5,44,28,3,60

												This game has a ton of personality, and for me, despite a few flaws, it goes a long way. It really is ""Monty Python meets Super Monkey Ball meets bowling."" ACE Team really knew how to put some outlandish material into the industry. Besides a few annoyances in gameplay (i.e. minor glitches, weird A.I., etc.) and somewhat abrupt ending, the game really is a gem of it's own kind and definitely worth a look.			",192,15,0,4,4,2,5

												Lots of fun with this game especially in online. Objective is to roll down a hill with enough speed and health to do damage to the opponents gate at the bottom. During time outs, with the money you earned on rolls you and your opponent have to place obstacles which include elephants, fans, towers, cannons and other obstacles on the opponents hill to weaken and slow them down. Sounds awesome, right? There's more modes and much more fun to this game, it's a gem that needs to be in your Steam library.			",207,35,5,15,14,2,26

												Top fun game for a limited time I feelThe multiplayer is really good fun and where all the fun is. When plYing solo I found the game boring, but then only a few rounds of multiplayer was enjoyable. The controls are simple to use with nothing special needed. The graphics are nice and clear, nothing special or serious but the game has a unique graphics setting which is more cardboard like.The audio is amusing and funny to listen to. Some of the sounds are very funny to listen too, from the scream when breaking into base, to the odd balls the game makes. The game is really good fun and easy to get used too, but the multiplayer is where all the fun is just after a few hours I became bored of the game.  Do not get me wrong it is worth the time you want to play because writing this review, the game is on sale for £1 so for that price you cannot complain.			",868,187,72,84,117,12,187

It is just pure ♥♥♥♥ing rediculousness. You control a mother♥♥♥♥ing stone ball that smashes♥♥♥♥♥♥ Oh and you're competing vs various gods and historically relavant people. To be more specific, it's basically a two sided race to the opponents fortress gate (you break the gate with your big♥♥♥♥♥rock), you have to get there as fast as possible while also avoiding obstacles placed by the opponent, when your rock has hit the gate or got destroyed by some mean elephant (no seriously, this game had elephants before Far Cry 4), you get to place these same obstacles.Very whimsical, uplifting, and sometimes challenging. A truly great game. Cheap, and easy to pick up and play (levels are fairly short and straight forward). ♥♥♥♥ing buy it!			",114,28,2,8,9,1,7

PresentationRock of Ages isn't exactly the type of game that you'll become instantly attracted to after the first glance, but looking beyond that and getting to play it will most definitely change your impression. The words that describe this game the best would be somewhere in the area of a tower defense with two ends where your only attack option to help you reach your enemy's gate is your giant boulder, boulder that you control. The story mode puts you and your customizable boulder travelling through time and space, starting with ancient Rome and ending with the Renaissance era, fighting different characters from each time and location such as Leonardo da Vinci, Plato or Napoleon Bonaparte. There is no real difference between all those battles except for the map where the battle takes place, but the short, humorous animations that introduce the battle are a delight, as they make fun of anything and everything such as the moment when Leonardo da Vinci realizes that kids nowadays play with boulders in a video game created using ""computieres"". There are plenty of such moments and even though there is no actual plot to tie-in those battles apart from the fact that your boulder is inexplicably rolling from one battle to the next one after you've defeated your previous adversary, you can return to each one of them at any given time in order to collect the remaining hidden keys, improve your scores or simply because you wanted to have a quick laugh at one of those animations one more time. Choosing your character and your boulder is easy and intuitive, having a simple option in the main menu that allows you to select those and apply them to all the modes, including Time Trial and Multiplayer.Rating: 8.5GameplayRock of Ages was meant to be a tower defense game at its core, but that isn't the thing that makes it fun to play, as the boulder rolling mechanic will steal the show every single time you play. In theory a winning combination would consist of a valid strategy in tower defense in order to stop your enemy from reaching your gate and good boulder-controlling skills so you can get past your opponent's defences and crash into his gate, but that isn't exactly the case as for most of the times your defences will do nothing, but slow down your enemy's boulder for a bit and unless you're playing against the AI which is dumb enough to get stuck in random places at times, it is almost impossible for a human being to fail getting past any number of defences, so the game becomes more of a speed test, awarding the fast one to roll his boulder into the enemy gate, using the tower defense mechanic only to buy a few extra seconds. One more thing that influences the gameplay comes in the form of boulder power-ups, which range from the Angel Wings that allow you to perform one double jump to the Sun Upgrade which will deal considerably more damage if you manage to get to the enemy gate with your power-up still intact. After finishing the main story, you will definitely want to play against another human being as the AI's actions are predictable and there's no real challenge in defeating one of the animated characters one more time, and even if you do have all the maps from the story at your disposal in Multiplayer, matchmaking isn't as smooth as it could be, as you can spend entire minutes finding someone to play with and even when you do, it will become boring after a while since the fastest one on a map will always win.Rating: 7GraphicsThe game is built using the Unreal Engine, which makes it a pretty thing to look at, but even so it is far from realistic and the physics can sometimes be weird, bouncing your boulder into a different direction. The crash effects are decent and the boulder damage, while not the best, does its job showing you what you did to your boulder after smashing it into all those towers. The level design on the other hand, makes things seem legit, as Rome will somehow look as you'd imagine Rome in miniaturistic style where boulders are supposed to roll for some reason.Rating: 7AudioThere is no voice acting, but the sound effects and grunts that the characters make sell the ironic theme of the game and make those short animations fun to watch. The soundtrack might not be the best, but it is certainly fixed to deliver the background ambient that fits the on-screen boulder-rolling in each of the stages, making those levels feel authentic to the period of time and the location where each of those characters belong in real history.Rating: 8ExtrasThe story can easily be completed within 5 hours, but afterwards you've got plenty of mini-games, reasons to jump back into the action for the missing keys and the Time Trial mode which will keep you busy for a few more hours if you want to achieve the gold medal for each one of the maps. The multiplayer, even with its issues can be a fun experience, especially if you find someone to play with for a longer period of time so you won't have to go through the matchmaking system after each match. Apart from the Online Multiplayer, the game also features a Local Multiplayer component which allows you and a friend to play all the modes in split-screen, however on the PC version you will need 2 controllers in order to do that, something that most of the PC gamers don't have, and considering the fact that the game only uses the direction keys, the game could have been easily played on the same keyboard.Rating: 7.5VerdictRock of Ages is fun and humours, so if you're looking for something different and with a healthy dose of parody humour, look no further, as this game will keep you busy for hours to come if you're digging its concept and you're willing to look past its flaws. There are limitations, without any doubt, and even with all the content package included in the game there was much more that could have been done, but for what it is, the game can easily keep you and a friend busy for an entire night, doing a bunch of different things and playing with the game's mechanics to try out new stuff.Rating Overall: 7.6Check out the full review and a lot more about Rock of Ages at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=234 ",142,34,2,13,6,2,7

												Gameplay:The idea of the Rock of Ages is unique, you control a rock rolling over various surfaces to destroy enemy's castle door, the enemy has the exact same goal, destroy your castle door first. It usually takes 3-4 rocks to destroy enemy's castle door. Once your rocks finish rolling or right at start of the game, there will be a period of time where you'll be waiting for a new rock to become available, giving you time to build defense units (towers, TNTs etc.) on the enemy's road to slow down the enemy boulder, or even destroy the rock completely. At start of the game you are given a specific amout of credits, allowing you to buy defense units from those. You gain credits when you hit enemy castle door and when you destroy the enemy defense units with your rock. There are 3 keys laid over every map, after every few levels, you'll require a specific amout of keys to be able to proceed further on in the singleplayer. The keys are easy to get and you can always replay any level, and even if you lose the game, you still get the keys you collected with the rock from the map, so there's no need to worry about the key part.In boss battles you simply are 1 rock inside some sort of arena where you fight the bosses, the goal is to kill the boss by hitting its weak point with the rock 3 times without getting destroyed by bosses' attacks.The rock HP system is quite complicated. The base rock has 3 layers each having some amount of hitpoints it can take before breaking. When a layer gets destroyed, your rock gets smaller, and inflicts less damage on enemy's castle doors, it doesn't affect boss battles anyhow though, except for the rock simply being smaller, making it a little harder to take damage, but also to hit the enemy. There are another types of rocks that you can buy for credits, such as a rock with 4th layer or a burning rock which basically has its first layer set on fire, making it easier to break through enemies, but it can get extinuished in levels containing water, changing it into normal 3 layer rock. Your rock can also fall out of every map, but it'll just respawn on the nearest checkpoint and it won't lose hp at all, so there's no need to be extra careful.That should be everything important I found worthy of mentioning from the gameplay, with that out of the way, I'd like to describe the other parts of the game.Game's art:You start at south coast of nowadays Italy's borders in times of Greek mythology, every new level, you move a bit forward in time and across the map of Europe (Borders of today's Italy, France, Spain and Portugal) , starting on tutorial fight with Hades in ancient greek times, moving throughout the levels all the way to late middle ages, fighting characters such as Charlemagne, Leonardo da Vinci and many more. There are short cutscenes before start of every battle, showing the enemies you are going to fight in sort of comic way, it's up to your personality whether you find them funny or insultive to Europe's history. Personally I liked most of them, but few of them took it too far (fighting the Plague, displayed as some sort of skeletal figure of human body for example). The design of the levels themselves was pretty simple, yet still nice. I could see a lot of effort going into design of the game's bosses. Except for some of the cutscenes, I liked everything from the game art-wise.Controls:I've got nothing to criticize in this part, the controls are fairly simple and work as they should.Performance:I was able to run the game smoothly on a low tier laptop without a single problem in framerate.Other:-The game also has multiplayer, but I haven't had the luck in finding someone to play with.-The singleplayer is pretty short, a good player will be able to finish the game within 2 hours. For average player, like I am, it shouldn't take more than 3 hours either.-Majority of the levels are easy, you can just place several elephants at the same place, and on most of the maps it will screw over the enemy rock's AI in single player, as the rock will get completely blocked and destroyed by the elephant defense units. Some of the defense units may feel much stronger compared to the other. I only found 1/2 of the defense units effective for most of the maps-The game could get repetitive after some time.Summary:Pros:-Unique idea of the game-Almost flawless design of the levels and cutscenes-Perfect controls-Perfect performanceCons:-The singleplayer won't take too long to finish, I'd be really suprised if it took someone more than 4 hours-Jokes in some cutscenes were taken too farFinal words:This is a first serious game review I've ever done. Took over an hour to do. I initially wanted to keep it short, but it seems like I failed doing so. Still only tried to include my view of the most important parts of the game, so hope I did not forget anything. At the time of writing the review, the game is 9.99€ in Steam store, I got the game with 75% discount due to a discount coupon for it I had, my friend reccomended it to me. I definitely don't regret spending those two and a half Euros on the game, it was worth it. If you're considering buying the game, I would say it's worth even its full price, but if it seems like too much to you, just wait for a discount, definitely worth taking at 5€ and less. I'm reccomending this game because the idea and its execution astonished me and I enjoyed the singleplayer all the way through.Thank you for reading this review, if you have any feedback, leaving it in the comments would be appreciated, it could help me if I'd be reviewing another game in the future.

												Roll your way through history as Sisyphus and his boulder. Flatten historical figures and classical concepts. Rock of Ages has a great art style and is a robust tower defense game that offers a different twist on the tower defense genre. You have to both protect your base and attack the enemy’s fortifications as a boulder that can be upgraded. Rock of Ages also has a great sense of humor which is highlighted in its cutscenes featuring both modern and historical references. Overall, it is a rock solid game that is worth playing both for its fun story and gameplay.			",144,40,3,13,15,4,36

												Comical but short, Rock of Ages is an fun little game filled with humorous jokes and scenes about various historical characters and time periods. It won't take you long to complete (it took me roughly six hours in total playtime, some of that just mucking around), however the way in which it combines traditional tower defence elements with intense rock-rolling action leads to a fresh and unique gaming experience.So, should you buy it?Hard to say. While you don't get much 'bang for your buck' in terms of hours compared to other games, it's nevertheless a unique experience - you'll have to make your own mind up on this one :P			",96,7,0,13,13,0,14

												A surprisingly good title; looked like shovelware or a C-title but it turned out to be real effin good and original.You control a boulder on its way to hit the castle doors of the enemy in each level. You navigate a map littered with traps and various other items that will wittle away at your boulders size (thereby decreasing the damage done to castle walls). Once the walls are hit, their health decreases-the aim is to get their health to 0 and then squish the person inside. After navigating the course and either suceeding or failing to get to the walls, you're then taken to an aerial view of the enemie's map, with the ability to spend gold for traps to make their boulder's descent just as difficult. Simple game, awesome concept, and great use of great works of art in the character animations. You go through several historical periods of western society, and since the character art is composed of animating still images of historical works of art, there's a nifty change in the art style as you progress through the ages. It's brilliant.And an obligatory shout out to Def Leppard hereshort game; great concept, cheap price; good deal			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game. I'm not sure if it's completely worth the price, because there's not tons of content, but if it's on sale you can't pass this up.It's like someone mashed an RTS, Mythology, and comedy all in one game, which they did! Multiplayer can be a bit buggy, but other than that this game has barely any glitches. Like I said before though, it could use a bit more content.EDIT:I also forgot to mention that there's a hilarious text-to-voice feature.

GAME WITH BALLSRock of Ages remains fun despite its problems, and makes for some great local competitive play. The campaign gets annoying at times because of the time constraints with defense building, but is quirky and funny enough that it ultimately remains worth the time. If you're looking for something unlike what you've played before, it's time to let Rock of Ages rock your world.			",270,47,11,25,15,1,25

Controls remind me of Katamari games, which are absent on the PC platform.

												A fun ride severely hampered by performance issues and clunky moments.Rock of Ages has all the right ingredients for being an all timer in the ""cult classic"" category. Goofy premise, unique style, fun gameplay, and great delivery. It all comes together in a great package and niche-feeling theme. Its a really unique take on the tower defense genre. You build defenses to protect your gate against your enemy's weapon; A rolling rock. But the game also features offensive play. You roll your own rock as well. A ball rolling game is a simple concept but still has to control in a satisfying way and this does on both keyboard and mouse and controller. While there is strategy involved, there's also a touch of racing as you try to get your roll and hit in before the AI to get ahead. It makes for some great fun. But the game's faults make it hard to outlandishly praise and even make the simple recommendation difficult. It is plain fun when everything is working right though! And you get a good amount of fun if you go for all the extras and collectables or whatever they are. The game felt really un-optimized for me as performance was lacking. Later levels with more commotion led to severe framerate drops. Severe. Even on the lowest of settings. There's people running it flawlessly on laptops so it was partial (bad) luck of the draw that it wasn't optimized for my toaster. But a quick search showed I was hardly alone and there were people even editing .ini files and such just looking for an extra frame. A little too messy and too much effort for a game that should run fine to begin with as far as I was concerned. So I just lowered the resolution and windowed it to tough out the last third of it. The story mode took me around 5hrs while going for all the extras. Solid length for such a ""small"" game. There's a few other modes left if I were inclined. The bosses while inventive departures from standard play and funny were usually quite clunky. They ended up a test of wills and a relief to finish rather than anything resembling a challenge and satisfaction. And the unique and inventive tower defense side of the gameplay did get fairly shallow once you developed strategies that worked against the AI well. Perhaps the depth truly lies in multiplayer, but that was never on my radar to play. Was a great game to get in a bundle like I did somewhere along the line and I wholeheartedly recommend it if its a deal, bundle or other bargain. But if the theme and gameplay idea isn't jumping out at you, its an easy skip. Its definitely a niche audience that will get the most out of it. With its problems it probably won't win anybody over by actually getting your hands on it and playing. A book that can be judged by it's cover perhaps? I could be off base here. But hey, if the cover looks interesting, take a roll for sure! Sequel in the works as well!			",349,99,30,51,32,9,68

												Rock of Ages is Monty Python's Flying Bowling Alley. The gameplay is excellent, as is the art style and the humour. I would make two suggestions. 1.) Use the ghost rock. Even when I was struggling to get the last few keys, I never tired of hearing the rock ""boooooo"" as it fell off the track. This should minimize frustration.2.) Use gold mines. If you use gold mines during the first run, the opponent will get a free pass to your door, but the second time you can load up on defenses and stop them cold.			",122,50,0,26,19,3,20

												Rock of Ages has faults - it's samey and repetitive in long-play sessions, for example, and if the trailers don't tickle you then there's little chance the full game will impress. However, considering the low price and artistic spark that lies at the heart of the game, Rock of Ages becomes a difficult game to turn down, even if the mechanical side of the experience doesn't quite rival the creative side, and there are occasional glitches with the physics of enemy AI.

As for the gameplay, essentially you have to set up a tower defense on your side of the mountain (there are over 20 maps) and get through your opponent's defence using a rather inert boulder, similair to those platformer bowling games. Your workers make a new boulder every now and then and it takes a while to smash the enemy castle. The gameplay is somewhat balanced, although cow defences are sadly underpowered.

'Rock of Ages' is 'Marble Madness' as tower defense. The developer 'ACE Team' is an indie studio, which has done magnificent work to this game. You play as a rock through certain decades of human history. You roll down the track and you get money for destroying the enemies buildings/units. The enemy does the same on the opposite of the level. At the beginning of the game and during the pauses you are able to buy and place buildings/units to stop/hurt the enemy. At last you have to destroy the fortress gate of the enemy as first.Pros:+ Very nice idea+ Humorously story and design (i laughed a lot)+ Retro feeling (Marble Madness)+ Multiplayer+ Achievements (easy to collect)+ 3 different modes (War, Time Trial, and SkeeBoulder)+ You can jump+ Boss fightsCons:- no adjustable difficult level (far too lightly)- there could be more levels/bosses(- no high replayability)Recommended, even if it's not on sale, because of the very humorously """"story"""" and the funny art/design.8/10 ",162,77,0,14,21,1,21

												The most unique and quirky game I've ever played, and likely ever made.Made by a team in my home country (Go Chile!), Rock of Ages is an odd hybrid between a bowling racer and tower defense. The game is a sort of duel between you and an opponent (either human or AI-controlled) in which you each throw boulders down a track toward your doors. Between rolls, money you earned from rolling your boulder can be spent on tower-like constructions to slow down, weaken and hopefully destroy your opponents boulder.The game features a huge amount of very fun maps, to the point of which it could've been a full game without the tower defense aspect. The humor is, as said by others, Monty Python-esque, with 2D paper-like animations for characters. The campaign takes you through much of history, with plenty of genuinely funny cutscenes!This is honestly a game I cannot recommend highly enough. It's quirky, sure, but the humor alone is worth the $10. Good luck, and first downhill wins!			",616,214,13,66,80,6,68

												If you want originality, this is probably the game for you. Just think about this :It's a mix of action platformer and tower defense, which is quite a startThe most famous pieces of art in history are used as assetsCutscenes are Monthy Python-esque movies parodying hisctorical figuresYou can crush Leonardo da Vinci as Napoleon. And that's just an exampleMichelangelo's David statue is a boss, and it scratches its butt when boredThis is just a few examples of the crazy things that can happen in this game. And it's not just about the humor : the gameplay is also interesting. To summarize it, it is a duel between two players (using crazy historical figures avatars) who both are on one side of a symmetrical map. The game alternates between a phase where you buy traps to set on your opponent's side, and a phase where you try to roll your boulder down your side of the map.Your opponent obviously has set up traps on your side (as you did on his), and you have to try taking as little damage as possible from them in order to damage the door at the bottom and eventually break it. All of this in real time so you have to be quick as well.It's a bit of a shame that the AI is fairly easy to exploit (a wall with catapults behind will usually wreck it). The AI also isn't the best at laying down the best trap combinations on your side of the map. Because of this the campaign will not resist you for long if you are a veteran gamer. Casuals should like this relaxed experience, though.If you can find a friend to play with online then the true potential of the game mechanics shines through.The game isn't very expensive anyway, so I still recommend it if you don't have a human opponent : the few hours it'll take you to see all the jokes and complete all the solo games modes are well worth it already.

												Running over the course of History with a giant boulderIt has be admired that someone came up with a simple concept of pushing a bolder down a hill and making it into stragety game. In this terry gilliam inspired world you are sisyphus the once banished king of ephyra who was doomed to all eternity to push a boulder hill only to do that exact same thing for the rest of eternity. But one day ol'sisy got the idea to instead use that boulder to escape his prison and from there go on journey through history to challenge famous figures in history against there giant boulders. People such as Vlad the impaler, Napoleon, and... a goat, okay sure why not. The whole game is about getting your boulder down the hill to smash against the enemy gate to literally crush the opposition into a fine pancake and move onto your next challenge. The courses are usually filled with normal obstacles like houses and people, traversing the enviroment for the fastest speed is the name of the game. But when you face off against your opponent they will set up more dangerous obstacles, such as defense towers, catapults, and elephants. All that will chip away at the layers of your rock decreasing its impact and sending it back to the top of the hill for a second go. But while your jumping and cereaning, the enemy will use there own boulder against your fort. You learn by your enemy that you have to create obstacles to stop the enemy boulder. The key being to find spechific spot that will slow down the deadly or just halt it all together. Its an interesing air of stragety and travesel that isn't seen very often in tower defense games. The boulder fantastically designed, its starts off slowly and requires a lot momentum to leave an impact in the enemy door. Those few seconds of falling off a cliff or being stunted by an elephant will cost you time and force to win the match. There are also varietes of the boulder, such as the spike boulder and the fire boulder, that will give you some extra fire power on getting past enemies. And getting past enemies is not that hard as the enemy boulder doesn't seem to know how to properly get around obstacles but a well time jump will get you over nearly anything. There are also boss battle in this strangely enough. Where you have to just aim for the right spot and ram into the bosses weak point to win. There pretty interesting from a design aspect but the gameplay around them amount to little then waiting for the right moment to strike, not really implementing much in way of stragety. Rock of ages is fascinating look into a tower defense game. It has funny visuals, responsive controls, and never really gets to hard in the way of gameplay. It may not be the longest game but if you have a passing interest in running over queen elizabeth, well this is the game for you... ya weirdo.			",368,162,3,30,20,3,35

												Rock of Ages is a fun and ""Rocking"" game (sorry that was really tempting XD. Anyway back to the review). When you play, you make buildings to defend your ""door"" (your base). Soon as your door is broken you lose! You break their door YOU WIN!!! When you have finished with the buildings ITS TIME TO ATTACK!! You destroy their base by breaking their door as i said earlier. Sooner or later the game starts to get harder. Oh and by the way you can customize your own rock and dont forget you can get a trollface rock so you have the trollface on your boulder/rock. Rock of Ages is a hell lot a fun game and definitely worth buying! To wrap it up, I'm just warning you, sometimes the game can glitch and move your mouse to the left corner for only that one defence bit then it goes back to normal. And the game is pretty ragey. I died 2 times on 1 level and I raged so much i hurt my hands XD. But the score that I'm giving this amazing masterpiece 10/10			",113,12,4,5,8,0,7

												On one hand, the story is too easy but with funny videos. On the other hand, the multiplayer is very competitive and requires skills. Nice learning curve, because you need to learn the shortcuts and best places for traps, on each map.You alternate playing a rock to reach as fast as possible the enemy's castle door, and then defending by placing different kind of buildings in the path of your enemy's rock. Everything happens in real time so you have to be fast and vicious.If you have a friend to play with or if you like competition over frustration, this game is totally worth the little price!

												Rock of Ages manages to be totally silly and still be a great game. Obviously made by people with a sense of humor, everything is specially designed to make you smile. The goofy nature of the game makes sure it’s never really taken too seriously while still being challenging in its own right.The game itself plays part race, part tower defense as you and your opponent take control of boulders rolling down separate but identical paths. Each player earns gold which can be used to purchase and place obstacles to slow the progress of the other player. The first player to smash their opponent’s avatar behind their gate wins. It’s a simple premise but each map offers a new challenge to overcome keeping the game from getting stale.The game still looks really good and feels exactly like you’d expect it to. Both the singleplayer and multiplayer modes are a blast, though admittedly you might have a hard time finding another person to play with. If you’re looking for something solid and unique, Rock of Ages is an awesome casual title. Just don’t forget to buy your friends a copy if you’re looking to try out the PvP. ",349,50,5,41,19,1,32

Not really something I'll play a lot of but I can appreciate the positives. There's nothing to really stop me from recommending you to buy this, if it tickles your fancy and has the right price.

Intro & SummaryACE Team have many of the things I love in a games developer- wit, charm, intelligence, uniqueness and rarity, and most of all, short, fun games. Rock of Ages is a great example, what would've been rolling rocks down a hill at stuff in anyone elses hands, has become a philosophical and historical♥♥♥♥♥♥take with some deep strategy and intense fun in multiplayer. The intelligent parts and humour were just as important for the developers as the gameplay, and that makes this title shine.Highlights* Great sense of humour, reminds me of Monty Python and Black Adder at times. May make you Crack up..* Offers surprisingly deep strategic and tactical gameplay for those who want it* Intelligence and wit that is far too rare in gamesMistakes* Slightly repetitive at times, needs to keep Rolling faster* This game isn't as hard as rock, it's too easy at timesRecommendationsRock of Ages is available for £6.99 / 9.99€ / $9.99 and routinely goes on sale for up to -80%. With a 5 hour campaign and an even better multiplayer experience, it's definitely worth a buy when on sale.* The soundtrack is pretty good, and included for free* You can unlock the Trollface boulder skin by winning a multiplayer War match ",632,194,19,62,47,5,80

												I'll start by saying that if you're a fan of Monty Python, this is for you.I am sadly late to the party on this, but.. This game honestly stands out from most of my library just in the way of it spewing out the best form of crude humor, where fart jokes actually are well done, quite a rare find in anything, especially with how they seem to be thrown around now-a-days because of a target audience they seem to want to attract but it's not pulled off in any form of decent or amusing way, it's just there for the sake of being there. Now that being said on with my ramblings.It steps out of the normal kind of game and steps into a comic like take on historic figures such as Plato and Aristotle, Napoleon, Leonardo Da Vinci etc, made into a tower defense video game, developed by the ACE Team. You are Sisyphus, a deceased character that was doomed to eternally rolling a cursed boulder up a hill only to have it roll back down before it can reach the top (Yes, I brushed up on my history for this), you suddenly get the bright idea to break out of your hell to then be the one rolling boulders over historical figures and amusingly squish them before they can squish you.. Which I must add, is more than satisfying. Especially with the little girly squeal.The multiplayer is also an amusing little add with being able to squish friends or just random people in other lobbies. It's not only amusing but quite challenging due of different play styles which also goes through in story mode as each historical figure has different tactics and items they use more of. Time trials are a good way to get familiar with maps to get the fastest time around each track finally we come to skeeball, just when you thought this game couldn't get any better, they add in carnival games to the mix. What more needs to be said.Rock of Ages is definitely one of the most unusual games I have played but one of the best. Sadly a bit short and lacking in the levels department in my opinion as I could have gone on for at least another 10 or so levels, but with solely that whinge aside, it is a perfect balance of amusing and challenging but not punishing and tedious.. I have not come across a game like that for quite some time. Honestly, this game is glorious and I would recommend it to anyone.			",385,129,19,39,53,4,53

												With a unique artistic direction (digging through Arts History), pop-reference humor and simple gameplay, this lovechild of Katamary Damacy and Monty Python's Flying Circus will delight every inch of your body ; if it is ready.The music (the OST is included for free) is elegant, drawing from classical music inspiration, yet engaging and well adapted to the environment. There are 18 stages, 4 bosses and several modes to keep you going for more. I could not try the multiplayer since there are few players owning it, but I cannot imagine it being anything but awesome. So buy this game and keep the rolling community growing, the King of the Cosmos would approve.			",294,203,1,44,28,1,29

												Basically, you roll this big rock and squish everything that gets in your way. The game offers humor and entertainment in a certain Monty Python style. The absurd cutscenes and the enjoyment of not knowing what to expect next are the main selling points, but the gameplay in itself is pretty fun too. It's simple, casual and fun for a couple of nights. It's not rocket science and there's not much room for finesse. Mostly you just roll away and hope for the best, but you can also set traps for your opponent. There's also a player vs. player mode. I think the game's definitely worth a couple of dollars, but don't spend your life savings on it - if the humor doesn't appeal to you at all, the game mechanics alone probably aren't that satisfying. I personally loved the paper cutout art style and all the funny little details. I didn't find the gameplay super addictive, but I wanted to complete one level after another just to see what crazy historical figure I was up against next, so in a way I was hooked right from the start.

												On one hand, the story is too easy but with funny videos. On the other hand, the multiplayer is very competitive and requires skills. Nice learning curve, because you need to learn the shortcuts and best places for traps, on each map.You alternate playing a rock to reach as fast as possible the enemy's castle door, and then defending by placing different kind of buildings in the path of your enemy's rock. Everything happens in real time so you have to be fast and vicious.If you have a friend to play with or if you like competition over frustration, this game is totally worth the little price!

												This is a great gem of a game.  The premise of rolling a rock down (or up) a hill is simple, but the sometimes-challenging obstacles make it a fun game.  The cinematics and tone of the game are humorous and the levels are different enough to keep it interesting.  The difficulty is just the right blend of simple and challenging to keep it playable but not always a snore to beat.  I wasn't sure what to expect from the game, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Rock of Ages is a keeper!			",271,58,17,17,9,0,33

Closest thing I can think of to this game is Odama on Gamecube. I didn't actually finish it, as I found it to have too many stages, and the same strategy works for almost all of them, but it was definitely fun for a few hours. It has a neat skiiball minigame too.			",501,122,11,54,26,6,76

												it's becoming more frequent that a company so console-minded opens up to PC crowds, but sometimes the results can end up in bad ports and games.This was not the case.I enjoyed immensely every little aspect that this game had to offer:FIrst: the design. I never seen before a game designed on the old history books illustrations, and even if they are not that pleasant to the eyes of whom is addicted to the digital, in Rock of ages finds new light. With monty-python inspired comedy cutscenes and various cameos througout the game, it certainly rips a chuckle during the fun gameplay.Second: the gameplay.It's original genre cannot really be defined. It can gather people who love racing games and at the same time who hates it. Part of it is dedicated to the rock rolling towards the door, trying to avoid the obstacles placed by our nemesis. The other half involves you actually placing those obstacles against the rock of your own nemesis. Important of this kind of gameplay, as deducted, is guided by the multiplayer. And Atlus knew it well. In fact this is one of the few gems to support local split screen multiplayer on PC, Needless to say i've had the most fun i've ever experienced when i brought a friend home to play.Soundtrack, graphics and the whole game itself is neatly served to be enjoyed with the rest of the game, only cons? It can get boring after some hours of gameplay, thankfully Atlus provided the game with 20 maps all very different one another.8.5/10			",329,52,12,22,23,4,39

												This game was just pure enjoyment for me from beginning to end. It's fairly short and even if you do all the content you'll still probably be finished with the game in less than 20 hours. It's just a very silly and fun game though.It controls kind of like Marble madness. It's a racing game where you control a giant boulder and have to try and make it to the end of the stage without getting the boulder damaged. This is harder than it sounds because while you are trying to make it to your opponent's castle to destroy it, they are trying to make it to yours.You can place traps down to mess up the other boulder. These are things like giant fans to blow it off the stage, elephants to crush it, and canons to blast it off track.This game has a great sense of humor and makes countless references to classic artwork and history.

												Rolling giant boulders downhill smashing all that stands in their way ought to be immensely fun. Somehow, it isn't here. They've done this weird vs. approach where you and an opponent throw boulders down the slope at each other's gates, first one smashed loses, and that's good enough for an arcade game. Along the way you smash dwellings, inhabitants, and similar bric-a-brac to get money, which buys you fortifications you can use to defend your gates against your opponent's rock.Problem is, the fortifications don't actually do much of anything to deter an incoming boulder—maybe they would if you had time to lay out defenses strategically, but because everything takes place in real time you're never given the chance to build your defenses with any kind of deliberation. So with the vast majority of the game's mechanics going un- or underused, it becomes a mad rush to launch your boulder first. Which quickly becomes less than interesting. It's entirely possible that the available defenses become more useful and engaging to play with in later levels, but the game doesn't hold my interest long enough to get at them. Which is really too bad. The art and sound design are unreservedly fantastic, with this great whimsical Terry Gilliam Python-era animation thing happening. I just wish the game was as much fun to play as it is to look at.			",121,17,0,8,7,2,5

												In a world were 99% of all new releases of games fall in 4 categories (FPS, RPG, horde, RTS), Rock of Ages is an extremely welcome addition. It is innovative, creative, very fun, addictive. Playability - and replayability - deserves an A++. It is something never seen before, at least not in recent times. The music is fun, but after a while it gets annoying. Also the voices of the ""little people"" screaming when you run over them is a bit badly done. Those 2, however, are the only drawbacks I was able to find in Rock of Ages, and they are minor, they won't prevent one from having a terrific time playing Rock of Ages. I was very glad I got this game.The graphics are very detailed. One can tell that attention was given to every detail in building the environment. That makes Rock of Ages a pleasure to play and, what is even better, makes it a game enjoyable by all ages.I highly recommend this game.			",223,65,29,22,36,0,48

												A very odd yet entertaining game about rolling boulders to defeat history's greatest. Place towers, catapults and elephants in a tower defence like map to stop your enemy's boulder while crafting your own and rushing towards them in a marble ultra blast style of game. All while you travel around in a very unique artstyle that seems like a near replica of Monty Python and the humour to go with it. A rather short game but still an entertaining time for a few hrs. 7/10			",243,24,7,26,22,4,40

												Rock of Ages is not a game for everybody. I will start this recommendation with that preamble, as I have already seen that it is not a universal acclaimed game. However, Rock of Ages is both a good strategy game and a lighthearted competitive game, an definitely merits a purchase. The tower planning portion has well rounded towers, with the exception of mammoths, which are very overpowered, and this gives many options on how to plan a defense. Attack-wise the smashing towers is made all the more fun by the humorously squashable people (little bouncing cut outs), and crushability of all towers with the right amount of persistence. Playing against friends with voice communications is sure to result in much merriment.			",337,57,3,45,43,3,60

I had a lot of fun with this for a few days. Unfortunately, once said singleplayer campaign is done, there isn't a whole lot of interest left to do, and multiplayer is decidedly dead.

												This is quite an interesting strategy game, in which you repeatedly fling a big rock down a hill to smash in the gate of your opponents castle. In between each roll you then set up defences and obstacles along your hill in order to slow, or destroy, the other players boulder. There are a number of types of defence units to choose from, like walls, turrets, bombs and resource farms, that can all be used in various momentum-killing combinations. On top of this you also have to decide - do you buy the new expensive wall? Or do you eschew building defences and instead spend the money on setting your boulder ablaze? The upgrades provide a bit of risk/reward. So in Rock of Ages a match will stress your strategic-thinking, time management, platforming and the actual steering a heavy rock down a hill.The game does have it's flaws, including some incredibly tedious boss battles, and none of the different systems run particularly deep. But as a whole, the game is made up of so many different game-mechanics cobbled together in such a fun way, that it is well worth having a try. I'd keep an eye out for it in the sales.

												Rock of Ages is one of these games which have a big aesthetic appeal, I really enjoyed pretty much every graphic in the game, how well they did fit for each stage and the variety of them.Gameplay is good, Your rock feels nice, controls are tight and boss battles were pretty creative and funThe audio is a really strong point too since the music and voices in this game is pretty cheerful and funny for the most part, It helps to create a good atmosphere in the game and it works pretty well.The multiplayer has various modes which are fun to play, There's a big advantage if you have played the maps beforehand but nothing game breaking, I didn't experience any issues with lag, desynch or anything else.I felt that the game overextended a bit and some keys where chore-some to get and 100% completion wasn't was fun as it should, I had to finish the game playing it in short bursts because it didn't kept me engaged enough.Pretty fun nonetheless, It's worth picking up in a sale.

												Rock of Ages is a strange tower defense game of some sort: in every match you will spend your time between making a huge rock slide towards your enemy door, in order to damage it, in a platform, third person fashion, and examining the battlefield from an aerial view, to set up defenses (towers, animals, explosives, ...) against the enemy rock.In truth, the main appeal of Rock of Ages is its art style: a Monty Pythonesque adventure taking place in different time periods (Ancient Greece, the Medieval Age, Italian Renaissance, Baroque, XIXth Century), with plenty of artistic references and a catchy soundtrack.Gameplay-wise, you can choose between a singleplayer campaign and a multiplayer experience. The AI for the first trips more than once, but it can be challenging nevertheless (more specifically, your enemy will be far less elastic than you in dodging obstacles and defenses, and later elephants will stagger his/her rock ad infinitum). Aside from the campaign, you have a challenge mode too.I suggest you Rock of Ages if you are going to enjoy the artistic, pop-culture and history references, or you just enjoy a rather good indie game			",143,41,0,17,0,2,8

												It's not easy to compare Rock Of Ages with anything else I've ever played. A single look at the game trailers should hint that not many games are quite as absurd and satyrical. My best attempt at a comparison would have to be a 3d version of Marble Madness with elements of Realtime Strategy. In short, players go back in history to build an obstacle course for their foe. As both players hasten to roll down the hill, they try to avoid obstacles and gather momentum in order to smash the enemy's gate and be the first to roll over their opponent. Storymode is fun and challenging on its own, but it's also a lot of fun to challenge your friends. Guaranteed to make you laugh, the Unreal Engine makes this a real joy to play!

												In rock of ages you switch between rolling a huge boulder against the enemy gate and building up your defenses to prevent the enemy boulder from doing the same to you. preventing only comes very late in the game with the most powerful defenses, until then its mostly trying to slow down the enemy as much as possible so that you are the first to crash their gate and roll them over. in between missions in singleplayer there are short cutscenes where historical figures and pop culture references are mixed together while having the artstlye of the specific time, this only serves for amusement and to introduce the new enemy though there is no higher plot. contentwise you cant really get more than 7 hours out of the campaign. even when going the completionist approach and collecting all keys (and some of those are a ♥♥♥♥♥ to get) The campaign contains 23 missions, 3 of which are bossfights. there is a bunch of different turrets that have 3 levels. this is not a normal tower defense though, since you are just fighting one boulder, which can also just crush everything you built. there is also 5 types of boulders that still come down to crush everything then crush the gate.  Still this is a fun game that I'd say is easyly worth 5 dollars. I can only speak for the campaign though, because I havent tried any other mode.			",265,56,0,58,16,2,53

												You might have played tower defense games like Kingdom Rush.  You might have played reverse tower defense games like Anomaly: Warzone Earth.  But have you played one that has both?  That's what Rock of Ages is about.  In each level, you control a boulder and the objective is to knock down the enemy's gates by repeatedly running your rock into it.  The problem is that to get there, not only do you have to navigate your boulder through a winding course in a physics-based game, the enemy is continuously setting up devices to block your way such as catapults and elephants with stone towers on their backs.  If your rock is damaged enough, it loses mass and will do less damage to the gate and if it's damaged even more, it can eventually break apart.  Not only that, but you have your own gate and the enemy has his own boulder.  So now you have a tower defense game, reverse tower defense game, and a racing game all packaged up into one as you and your opponent are trying to outdo each other in defenses while trying to destroy each other's gates as fast as possible.  This was a surprisingly fun game with many unique levels and ideas that gets even better with the fact that it has not only online multiplayer but local as well.  It also helps that the campaign story has a great sense of humor.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I can honestly not tell you a pass time that is as rewarding or fun as rolling your big hard balls around with your bros.

Gameplay is simple to learn but there are some difficulty spikes every now and then (if you don't know how to roll a ball down a hill, now would be the right time to start learning.) and choosing the boulder you will use will sometimes result in added artificial difficulty.

												I have not yet played the multiplayer option, but I can say that I was incredibly surprised from even the start of the game. Rarely do game trailers accurately reflect the hilarity and fun factor of a game, so I did not expect anything like what the trailer shows. Boy, was I wrong about this one. This game is simply incredible. Hilarious, one of the best soundtracks of any indie game I've ever played, and clearly inspired by the animations that are everpresent in Monty Python's Flying Circus episodes and beyond. At twice the price, this game would be a good buy, at the regular price, it's a downright bargain. I think that this game would be much more popular if there was some way for people to know what they're getting into. This is hilarity and fun at its finest. My only, very minor complaint is that the controls can be a little bit difficult. However, you're guiding a giant boulder, so I weigh in on that as being built in to make the game challenging. Less than an hour in and, already, it's one of my favorite indie games. This is really saying something, at least for me. 9.5/10 - I simply will not have a better time than I have in just a half hour of playing this game. Fun, fun, fun, fun, hilarious, and fun.

												Rock of Ages sure was an interesting, yet oddly very fun, experience. Let me re-emphasis the part when I said this game is odd. This game had me laughing and raising my eyebrow in question most likely every cutscene and level.Honestly this is a ""Get the 'marble' to the goal and avoid obstacles"" type of game, yet Rock of Ages just makes that type of game very enjoyable. The player must  roll their Rock down a variety of somewhat challenging maps, while the opponent tries to defend his/her pathway to the castle gate. While the oppenent is also trying to reach the player's gates, one must defend their pathway. The boss battles were fun, yet the boss battles didn't seem to get more challenging as I reached near the end of the game. There was only 4 boss battles, making this game feel sort of shor in Single Player. I haven't even checked out the Multiplayer yet.  Overall this game was a fun to play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Crush all the things!Rock of ages takes you on an adventure through a parallel history in which Sisyphus, the man doomed to roll a stone up a hill for all eternity, finally gets fed up with his punishment and rebels. After breaking out of Hades and into the mortal world, he begins using his mighty boulder to crush all who stand in his way. Along his way he crushes fellow rock collectors Cronos, Vlad Tepes, Charlemange and Leonidas.It's a simple idea but it's a very fun game.Buy if you love smashing things with boulders and squashing the kings of history as they scream like little girls.75 Rocks / 100.

												Rock of Ages is my shepherd, I shall not be in want.  It makes me lie down in green pastures, it leads me beside quiet waters,  it restores my soul. It guides me in paths of righteousness for Rock of Age's sake.  Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me.  You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.  Surely goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of Rock of Ages.			",59,4,0,6,2,1,1

												A really great idea for a game wrapped in a hilarious setting with Pythonesque cutscenes. The gameplay is really interesting, switching between rolling a rock down a twisting path to reach the bottom and smash a door, while taking as little damage as possible, then setting up obstacles for your opponent's rock and trying to hit them with projectiles. The story levels take about 3 hours, and is mostly fun but have mediocre bosses, and you can also play online with other people - however I have not touched this so I do not know how it runs or how full/empty the server is.

												This is definately a strange concept for a game. You play as a rock, smashing things and you compete with some historic figures who also has a rock and you try to smash the others fortress gates. You can choose to place traps, obstacles and other annoyances along the way to stop the opponents rock from reaching your fortress. And of course he does the same!It has a good sense of humor, it had me giggling a lot. I especially love that the rock shouts in terror if you fall off a cliff! It's easy to understand the tutorial and learn the game, though placing the traps in a good place is a learning process. But thankfully you get to see a camera view of the opponents rock going towards your fortess, so you can tell what parts is too easy.You also have a lot of fun things to annoy your opponent with. My personal favorite is spamming the board with cows.I have to say it... this game Rocks!			",172,366,6,57,34,3,40

												This game is definitely worth a purchase if you want a game to play with a friend. The single player, while good, doesn't hold your attention for very long. It's really just roll down the hill over and over again on different maps. But the unusual mechanics and light-hearted nayure of the game make it perfect to play with someone else.

												In all my years of playing games, I have never encountered one quite like this. Rock of Ages is a really unique game that takes you throughout parts of european history and pits you in a bowling match against many famous characters. Sounds...bizarre, right? Well, that's because it is. If you haven't picked it up I would definitely recommend that you do (especially on a sale.) Pros:+good sense of humor+interesting story+Bowling!+very unique gameplayCons:-does seem to get somewhat repetative-other game modes provide a minimal amount of fun-boss fights are too simplistic Overall: 7.5/10 ",87,12,2,6,4,0,3

I cannot state this enough, you bust the ♥♥♥♥ out of Hades with a boulder and ruin history.6. It's like Drive Angry except Nic Cage is a mother♥♥♥♥ing boulder. How much clearer can I get?7.

												Leonardo DiCaprio was a great influence on this work of art and I don't think anyone could've done it without him. God bless and god bless and I hope we all keep this lesson to heart. This is truly a great game. Red hot and stone cool, Rock of Ages deals the seal with the rolling time genre. Definitely yes.			",85,13,0,8,9,2,14

												This game is definitely worth a purchase if you want a game to play with a friend. The single player, while good, doesn't hold your attention for very long. It's really just roll down the hill over and over again on different maps. But the unusual mechanics and light-hearted nayure of the game make it perfect to play with someone else.

												In all my years of playing games, I have never encountered one quite like this. Rock of Ages is a really unique game that takes you throughout parts of european history and pits you in a bowling match against many famous characters. Sounds...bizarre, right? Well, that's because it is. If you haven't picked it up I would definitely recommend that you do (especially on a sale.) Pros:+good sense of humor+interesting story+Bowling!+very unique gameplayCons:-does seem to get somewhat repetative-other game modes provide a minimal amount of fun-boss fights are too simplistic Overall: 7.5/10 ",87,12,2,6,4,0,3

												Reasons to buy RoA:1. It's a game where you ♥♥♥♥ up plenty of historical figures with a boulder.2. Controls well and has some fun multiplayer modes.3. It's $10 (or less depending on when you read this!)4. No, seriously, run Marie Antoinette over with a mother♥♥♥♥ing chunk of rock.5. I cannot state this enough, you bust the ♥♥♥♥ out of Hades with a boulder and ruin history.6. It's like Drive Angry except Nic Cage is a mother♥♥♥♥ing boulder. How much clearer can I get?7.

												I had a surprising amount of fun with this little game. Yes, the game is about rolling a boulder down a hill to break down a gate, but what seperates this game from other (rolling the ball down the hill ?) games is the art direction, style, and humor which reminds me of the old Monty Python and the Flying Circus skits. I played the game when it first came out and haven't touched it much after, but then the game was very easy. This would be my only complaint. They could have patched the game to change some things to make building defenses actually useful, but I can't truthfully account for the developer's actions. At 10 dollars, you can't go wrong, in my opinion with this game. It's a little ball of fun, something to make you smile and have fun while doing it.			",263,54,3,35,27,3,40

												ACE Team presumably licensed Def Leppard's ""Rock of Ages,"" from their album ""Pyromania,"" to make this game, but I'm having a lot of difficulty understanding how the game relates to the song. First of all, the song's not in the game, so that's weird. Second, they appear to have taken the lesson of the four nonsense words that the song starts with (""gunter glieben glauben globen"") to mean that the dialog in the game should be gibberish. Interesting choice. Finally, in place of power chords, a strong beat you can clap to, and exciting lyrics that seem to simultaneously entreat and inspire, this game includes a rock that smashes stuff. In sum, I'm incredibly confused, but that's okay because this game is amazing. I guess you could say it ""rocks."" Rock of Ages, still rolling, rock and rolling, gets 10 out of 11 rocks.

												Solid gameplay (For a boulder rolling game)Controls are good, WASD, Space to jump.Boulder feels like it has weight.It is fun to smash towers and people.Humor is funny and a bonus for people who know history.Occasional stuttering despite being on a high end system.Campaign is relatively short (4 hours)Other single player modes are Okay, but mostly fairly boring.Pick it up on sale. It is definitely worth th $1.29 I paid for it. Probably $2.99 would be a fair price.7/10

												This game. It's easily one of the most ridiculously childishly fun games I've ever had the pleasure of playing. The sheer, simple enjoyment of rolling a big ol' boulder into something (or better yet, SOMEONE) combined with the almost Monty Python-esque slapstick humour, makes it so ridiculously funny, it's worth it just for the sake of laughing at (and with) it for an hour on end. Probably even more. And the gameplay kicks äss too! 8.9/10			",256,39,2,25,30,0,45

												Pretty fresh and creative game, you and your ai enemy each have a base and can build defense structures for money, after a specific amount of times your minions will have build a big boulder ball for you to run into your enemy territory and destroy his fortress. You get money by destroying his defense structures, can upgrade your ball or buy better defences.			",1322,277,34,78,65,11,107

												This game is original and fun for the first few levels, but if you are going for 100% achievements then the developer's trolling placement of the keys on some levels gets increasingly rage inducing as you are forced to try over and over again to fluke trick shots by smashing into edges to abuse the janky physics engine.

												It can be fun in short sessions. The idea is to roll your boulder to the enemy base and destroy the door before he breaks down yours. There's a little bit of strategy involved; the game lets you place things like buildings and cows on the map to stop or slow down the boulder (if you aren't careful your boulder will also stop dead in its tracks). It's a very simple idea and it gets the job done. But I did expect a little more from the guys from Zeno Clash. It's not a bad game; it definitely has its moments (the graphics and sounds are great, for example), but not enough to keep me interested for hours.[Rating: 74/100]			",1661,635,69,221,194,16,225

Premise is great, execution is bad.The goal of the game is to roll down a track (where your opponent can place tower defence style traps to slow you) and smash down the enemy door to win.The core issue is no matter how much you chip away their boulder to make it smaller or they chip away yours it seems to take 3 to 4 hits to a door regardless of your rocks size. This in turn makes most of the tower defence aspects laughable.After you learn of this critical balance issue in multiplayer it becomes a mad dash race to the finish and the actual tactics of defence building serves no point.

												Roll down a hill and try to destroy things, but don't slow down too much or you will not do enough damage to the door at the end of the pathway. You play against an AI that is trying to destroy your fortifications meanwhile you try to destory his, first to break open the door and the end of the other person's path wins, and gets to watch their opponent crushed by a giant ball with a face on it.Interesting concept, would roll and crush cows again.

												i got this game thinking it was fun. but i only got a bad 4 hours of fun with it! its just a small game with people that dance like they just took some happy pills and decided to get drunk and go take ballet lessons! one things for sure i would rate it a 2/10. the only way you can realy find a good match is if you play it with a friend! no one is playing online! sure the dragon boss in the campaign is cool but the game is just bad. You can easily make defences that are good my just adding a 2 tile thick wall of war elaphants! and ontop of all that its 15 dollars! like seriously! it should be at most a 5 dollar game! otherwise its not worth it.

												Purchased this game after watching many lets plays of it and was really excited to see it on the steam sale for only 4.99. Downloaded the game only to find out the game has had many issues with getting the game to even start. So the long and the short of this is I not only spent 5 dollars for a game that doesn't work but I also spent three hours trying to trouble shoot only to find out it wasn't worth the 5 dollars or my time. The game looks fun but if they can't fix this major issue than there is no point buying it			",105,14,0,28,18,0,18

												I had a long think about this one but ultimately chose not to recommend. The reason is the game just doesn't change enough as you progress. The first few levels were OK but it was extremely repetitive and not in a good way. As the difficulty increased so did my frustration. The map changes each level an you have to spend a run or two to figure out the paths and shortcuts along the way. This means you generally lose the first three times you play it. Of course the AI knows exactly where all the shortcuts and cheats are so it blocks you from taking them, but as you are still learning the map you make a lot of mistakes.I played for nearly two hours and am done with it.

												I was intrigued and somewhat excited by the trailer of the game, so I gave it a try.Unfortunately for me, I tried the first level using mouse and keyboard and I wasn't able to properly control the rock, not to mention complete the level. After moving to the gamepad the game felt a little better and I found rolling the rock challenging enough for my (average) reflexes.But when the gameplay expanded to include building towers, I felt overwhelmed and not that excited about. It's not that the game is bad or something, just that it is definitely not for me.			",216,35,0,31,6,0,20

												This game caused my computer to crash every single time that I attempted to play it. I tried numerous times, and on each occasion, the game would freeze and I would be incapable of exiting it, going to task manager, or even shutting down my computer. I uninstalled it so as not to waste time. I'm sure that if the game actually works for you, you'll have a good time, but I couldn't recommend a game that didn't function as intended.

												I really had high hopes when I bought this game. Sadly, the camera angles during gameplay are so bad, I can't see where I'm rolling. I've rebinded my keys and it still doesn't help me see. As soon as I jump, there goes the camera and any enjoyment I had. The art and level designs are nice, but this is just unplayable for me.

												This one is like a weird racing game. For those who enjoy racing games, especially where there are obstacles and also things you need to run over with your vehicle, this might be a good game for you. I'm not really a racing fan, though, and didn't realize quite what the gameplay would be like when I decided to try it on a steam sale. The rock is not easy to steer and I wasn't having enough fun to put in the amount of practice that would be needed to get better at it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A really sub-par game, I seriously don't understand why the there are so many positive reviews. Basically, if you play the first level of the game, you've played them all. People keep saying ""Monty Python-esque"" but I don't see it. I suppose if you think Monty Python's humor was solely based on using historical paintings to make ♥♥♥♥♥♥ jokes, then you would consider this game to be very Monty Python. The gameplay is pretty basic: you control a boulder and you try to roll it towards the enemy's castle. Defenses are placed in your way to slow and destroy your boulder. The game is also a race, the enemy also is trying to destroy your castle's gates and you place defenses to slow the enemy boulder. Sounds fun, right? Defenses are pretty flimsy and easy to get around, so when facing the AI's boulder, all you really have to do is make a few choke points. So as a tower defense, its really ♥♥♥♥ing poorly designed.  There aren't any punishments for falling off the stage, so the player is prertty free to go as fast as possible, and take large leaps across the map, making any defenses placed by the AI completely useless. Controlling the boulder is pretty easy so there's no real challenge in making these leaps above defenses. The game becomes super repetitve and there aren't any rewards for the player. Sure, you get to watch a silly cinematic, but on the whole, they're really ♥♥♥♥♥♥.			",85,11,1,11,5,0,11

												I hate to leave negative reviews, because I've played a lot of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥games on steam, and hav'nt even bothered to review them.This game could have been amazing, because it has that arcade feel to it, (thanks ATLUS) but unfortunately the Single player is just wrong. You have a minute of super monkey ball fun then it becomes a tedious tower defence with poor controls and no control over the ai launching attacks faster than you at the same time. The game would have been really fun if it was:1: The levels get harder to navigate but you can still roll and build up points/levels2: No poorly implemented tower defence aspect3: AI building faster and better than a C&C hack ",873,245,43,86,70,16,164

I feel like there isn't any real information provided about the tower-defense portion of the game, so everything is trial and error.TL;DR: Interesting concept, not for me or, I would think, most people.

												Neat Idea, but executed poorly. Think of a tower defense where you can just go around the defense unharmed. That's Rock Of Ages. The multiplayer would be fun, but the problem is the lack of money, tiles for unit placement, and viable strats are very few and far between. The different rocks are worthless for the most part, and there is too many useless units you can place down on the ground. Single player story is funny, but it's the same thing over and over. Boss fights are pretty lack luster as well. Sadly the only thing this game has in common with Zeno Clash is the music. While it is not as memorable, you can still hear those jungle♥♥♥♥♥beats. Wait for a sale if you are interested. There's just better games out there.			",409,188,9,75,28,5,69

												At first blush, this game appears to be good, wacky, irreverent fun somewhat in the vein of Monty Python. The gameplay is full of original concepts you will find quite literally nowhere else, and I admit, at first I was gripped.The honeymoon period, however, wears off quickly, as the game begins to throw more and more unfair, unbalanced tripe unintuitive gameplay elements that weaken the core experience, and the single-player mode drags fairly quickly; there's only so much some quick satire of history can do for me.If you can pick this up for a song, go for it, but don't expect it to entertain you long. It's a neat experiment, but ultimately I don't feel that it's one that succeeded.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A historically accurate 1v1 tower defense game where you control a boulder using the rolling physics to maneuver the boulder to bust down the enemy gate's HP while also defending your own gate's HP. I found it fun for a short while before quitting due to lack of interest as it can get pretty repetitious because for the most part you're basically just maneuvering a boulder through or around the enemey's tower placements with jumps and the basic movement controls, though the boulders can come in different variations within the match you're currently in should you purchase them with the money you earned destroying structures and smothering people.

												I asked for a refund. The game advertises partial controller support. From my experiences with other games this usually means the menu is not compatible with a controller, or that you might have to make some minor adjustments.In this case, the functionality was so poor the game was basically unplayable. It might be possible to get it to work normally, but I didn't find it worth my time to mess with it any further.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I hate to say it but I simply cannot recommend this game. Not because it's not fun (it is!) not because it's not clever and witty and funny (it's totally all 3!) but because it is such a royal pain to try and play thanks to the attached DRM connection requirements. It does NOT run through Steam and instead requires an outside connection to the developer's servers which work spottily if at all. Basically, it's a fantastic little game and the price is right but actually playing it feels like a chore.			",214,36,1,28,22,3,37

												Way too difficult to Control, not incredibly funny, Took me by surprise to have some sort of tower defence when the enemy goes up against you as well, a bit laggy, controls are WAY too sensative, I tapped the D key, nearly turned my Boulder right around, almost a complete 180. Not enough things to destroy, music is bleh, Animations are a bit Flash gamey in cutscenes. I got it for about 2 bucks on sale, Kind of wish I could get a refund, cause now I have to see this game every single time I go into my Library, but that's a Steam thing, Kind of wish there was a thing like steam bucks or something, but anyways, this game also downloaded a lot of stuff on my PC I don't think are needed to even RUN the game. So I am a bit worried, a couple of files in my Computer files named a bunch of random Letters and numbers really, Kind of scared me really.  So Let's Recap.Bleh MusicPoor Animated Cut scenesOversensative controlsUseless Tower defence system cause the CPU is cheapNot enough destructionLame comedyand non-refundable experience. (But that's Steam's Problem really, Serious Steam, Please find some way To get your customers to get refunds! Like store credit for half of what you payed for the game would be ACCEPTABLE In my book!)I do not recommend this game, some people like it, but my expierience is just terrible with this game, I beat the first level and was jumped by the whole tower defence thing, I put down as many towers as possible in tight places. The CPU Just rolled right on through them at high speed, not hitting ANY of em, so yeah, CPU Is cheap. ",218,35,1,21,12,3,5

												So I tried this game back on the Ps3 and didn't like it. I didn't remember why though and saw this for like a buck and thought i'd give it another go.Now I remember!The humour is nothing like Monty Python because it would have to be funny. This humour consists of fart jokes and refrences ala 'Epic Movie'. The gameplay is the most tripe♥♥♥♥♥♥I have seen in quite some time. You roll a boulder down a short path and hit the other guy's door. Takes about 3 good hits. The other component is placing easy to dodge traps/barriers in the way to slow the other guy down.Sounds like it could be fun but it is poorly executed here. The story is throw-away at best.The music is non stop medevil style dance music. It gets old real fast.Pass this game up. Its not worth anything.			",271,45,1,57,28,2,30

												One of my first Steam games. The game has a really unique art style and storyline. I can really appreciate that about this title. It certainly feels like an 'indie' title built from passion.I tried playing this several times by myself, and with friends. I always ended up scratching my head trying to figure out the game mechanic and why it is alluring. It really isn't that fun. It is like extreme bowling or something lol.

												I am growing fond of ACE and their games. Zeno clash was fun and this has it moments. its more than a tower defense rts, you actually learn history. OK maybe not. there are historical figures, thats about it. object is to smash and squish your opponent. while also stopping them from doing the same to you.  there were times I found it to be rather easy and others frustrating. It was fun while it lasted but I dont see my self in dulging in MP too much or continuing with the SP challenges. unique to say the least. 5.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was looking for an inexpensive, fun game to buy for my friend and I to play for a few hours while we waited for something... It was a while ago, so I forgot what we were waiting for. Anyway, this game was fantastic fun to play with someone you know! It turned out to be hours of co-op excitement over the next few days, and we still play it occasionally. OH, the best part? Text to speech!!1 When you aren't building towers or steering your rock, you can type obscene messages for the nice little voice to repeat. Although I'd recommend you play with a friend, the single player can be just as entertaining. It's cheap, fun, the quality is surprising (no bugs at all), and will keep you giggling like little girl every time you launch it. Go ahead and buy it!			",64,10,2,5,8,2,4

												Rock of Ages is a mix between racing Super Monkey Ball-style down a track to break your opponent's gate, and tower defense to set up defenses to prevent your opponent from doing the same.It's a very whimsical game, with cutscenes reminiscent of Monty Python and a presentation to match. It's got a great charm and even if you don't like history too much, it will bring a smile to your face.The gameplay is actually pretty simple, but executed well. Although the rolling is kind of stiff, the boulder doesn't feel out of your control (unless you hit an explosive barrel or get shot by a catapult), and has a good sense of speed. The defense phase (while waiting for a new boulder to be prepped) is alright but it feels somewhat arbitrary, since it's difficult to tell how well your defenses are working.Overall, this game has style, and the gameplay is pretty enjoyable. It's quite cheap and worth checking out!			",243,32,5,13,6,2,26

												Sisyphus, an immortal Greek Titan, has a job to do. For the rest of eternity he must push a giant boulder up a hill in Hades until a magical enchantment causes it to roll back down to the bottom again. Understandably enough, Sisyphus eventually decides this un-life isn’t for him and swiftly breaks out of Hades, taking his giant boulder and some Titan buddies with him.Rock of Ages is a hilariously chaotic mixture of Insane Obstacle Course and Tower Defence, alternating between guiding your boulder into the enemy gates to break them down, and building medieval weaponry to stop your rival boulder from breaking your own gates. It’s a genuine pleasure to watch your hastily erected dynamite finish just in time to blast your opponent completely off-course with white-knuckle timing.As you progress through the campaign by massively interrupting famous European historical events, you unlock more Tower Defence items to stymie your opponents efforts and more rock types to destroy the enemy gates which does an excellent job of keeping the gameplay of Rock of Ages fresh and delightfully experimental; will only using War Mammoths stop your opponent wrecking your gates more than wall after wall of dynamite?Rock of Ages also shines in the cutscenes between levels with both a unique art style and hugely funny direction. Famous characters and events are played out on screen in a 2D mumble-speech cinematic, with the famous opponents (normally accurate, although Plato and Aristotle probably never came back from the dead) highlighted in a massively dramatic way. It brilliantly furthers the light-hearted and joyfully silly theme.It quickly becomes apparent when playing Rock of Ages that it is a game wholeheartedly about the joy of play. Each level is short enough that progress is never too far away and you will never guess what the game is going to throw at you next. With a depth of silliness that will bring a smile to any face Rock of Ages is a pure joy to play and happily provides many hours of shameless fun.			",78,23,0,12,14,0,20

												This game is so quirky. Imagine 10-pin bowling meets tower defense. The art style is really crisp with hilarious Monty Python style cutscenes. Essentially you roll your boulder down a hill to smash it into the enemies gates. whilst yor minions are making you a boulder, you can set up defenses to try and smash the enemy's gate. It's a lot better with a controller, which I have still yet to buy,  but I'm really enjoying it so far.			",98,18,1,12,8,0,21

												A very enjoyable, funny, strategy game. Very fun on both singleplayer and multiplayer, however the AI can be a bit easy. The main concept of the game is that there are 2 players, each with their own half of the map. While your boulder is being constructed you can spend money on different defenses to ensure that it is not easy for the other player to send their boulder down to your castle doors and destroy them and kill you, winning the game. When the boulder is constructed you can spend further money on different boulders which have their own unique abilities or use the most basic boulder for no cost. On your way down the map you can destroy enemy defenses and other obstacles to gain money but this will deplete your boulder's strength, making it less effective against the enemy gates. 8/10			",81,7,1,6,5,1,5

												Monty python bowling made by the guys behind Zeno clash. It looks mad, crazy and the humor is crude. It's about rolling stones over things and crushing them, also defending gates. It's mad and bad and you will love it!			",294,37,2,29,21,3,56

												Fly a terrified living rock down a hill, crash into nude cardboard-cutout Greeks, smash huts and doors, kill cherubs en masse. Cutscenes = such classic comedy tropes as Vlad the Impaler (cardboard-cutout version of course) turning into a bat that echolocates via kissing sounds. You also are allowed the privilege of engaging in a duel with the Bubonic Plague himself.			",90,19,0,7,3,0,17

I don't reccommend it at 10 bucks, but if it's on sale, I don't care what you have to do- sell an orphan, slay a dragon, sell a dragon and slay an orphan. Buy it. It's even more fun with friends racing each other using the Block.			",164,22,1,36,22,0,33

												Words cannot describe how much fun this game is. But I'll try to anyway...This is basically a game where you roll a boulder down to smash your enemy's gates wide open and move in for the kill. Of course, they're doing the same exact thing. So how do you stop them? With towers! Part tower defense, part racing game, part smash-every-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-thing-you-see game, it's quite fun when you get the hang of the controls.			",262,65,6,40,20,3,35

												I am growing fond of ACE and their games. Zeno clash was fun and this has it moments. its more than a tower defense rts, you actually learn history. OK maybe not. there are historical figures, thats about it. object is to smash and squish your opponent. while also stopping them from doing the same to you.  there were times I found it to be rather easy and others frustrating. It was fun while it lasted but I dont see my self in dulging in MP too much or continuing with the SP challenges. unique to say the least. 5.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Prepare yourself for the journey of a lifetime.Welcome to rock of ages, a game about rolling a boulder down some... interesting places. Due to a lack of competence, I cannot say much about the difficulty of the game, but I can speak about the actual mechanics:-The game features interesting tower defense which does add to the game positively-The cinematics have an interesting art style that always keeps the viewer amused-The levels are designed with multiple routes which allow for fun gameplayIn terms of graphics, I am fairly impressed with the actual gameplay, but it seems to downsize the resolution everytime I reboot the game, which may get annoying.The controls are generally good, but occasionally tend to bug outIt is fairly fun but not something I would play for more than a couple of minutes in singleplayerThe multiplayer mode did suffer from some connection issues when I tested it, but it pretty funI would reccomend this game to anyone who likes silly things and just generally anyone.

												What can I say about this game. I didn't expect what I got...maybe that is what I should say. I purchased this game as part of a bundle and started playing it and let me tell you, it is strangely addicting. As I'm sure you're aware, you play as a boulder, rolling through a course, trying to destroy the opponent's gate first and kill them while they are trying to same to you. You lay traps for your opponent as well as they do for you, making this an oddly fun game. There are only two downfalls to this game. One, the game is, for the most part, fairly easy. Sure, it doesn't take much for one to buy and play this game but there isn't much of a challenge for those looking for it, though there is multiplayer. Second, there are collectables in this game: Keys. These keys, early on, are easy to get and put in places which you must creatively think how to get. That being said, the later keys are unfair to get, especially the one on the last level before the final boss. Overall, a solid, easy game which can be enjoyed for a few hours.

												This game is so quirky. Imagine 10-pin bowling meets tower defense. The art style is really crisp with hilarious Monty Python style cutscenes. Essentially you roll your boulder down a hill to smash it into the enemies gates. whilst yor minions are making you a boulder, you can set up defenses to try and smash the enemy's gate. It's a lot better with a controller, which I have still yet to buy,  but I'm really enjoying it so far.			",98,18,1,12,8,0,21

												A very enjoyable, funny, strategy game. Very fun on both singleplayer and multiplayer, however the AI can be a bit easy. The main concept of the game is that there are 2 players, each with their own half of the map. While your boulder is being constructed you can spend money on different defenses to ensure that it is not easy for the other player to send their boulder down to your castle doors and destroy them and kill you, winning the game. When the boulder is constructed you can spend further money on different boulders which have their own unique abilities or use the most basic boulder for no cost. On your way down the map you can destroy enemy defenses and other obstacles to gain money but this will deplete your boulder's strength, making it less effective against the enemy gates. 8/10			",81,7,1,6,5,1,5

												Une expérience de jeu assez courte (5h de jeu pour finir la campagne solo) mais malgré tout un bon challenge : certains circuits nécessitent une dextérité digne d'un poulpe !Le jeu est monty-pythesque au possible et les cinématiques (certes décalées par rapport à l'Unreal Engine) tiennent la route et font office de ciment entre les différents niveaux.Le mode multijoueur est anecdotique, mais si vous avez la chance de jouer en coop avec un ami à côté de vous, go !En ce qui concerne le mode ""contre la montre"", ne pas se faire d'illusion : les scores sont ""coréens"" et imbattables. Mais il est toujours plaisant de se balader dans différentes villes d'Europe à la sauce Ace Team.			",277,55,4,25,12,2,33

												It's sort of like if Terry Gilliam tried to make a bowling game but he had just spent five days straight playing a combination Katamari Damacy and various Tower Defense games and got them all confused in his head. The result is Rock of Ages, a fun boulder-rolling adventure through the millenia and a million times better than The Brothers Grimm or The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus.			",203,37,7,28,14,3,51

												I wasn't sure of this game at a glance, so I bought it with the Christmas deal that's running as I write this. Highly, highly recommend it. It's a great mixture of strategy and...I'm not sure what to call it, action? More accurately would be strategy and rolling. At first, you may not see the appeal, but the game has a great sense of humor, along with smooth gameplay, a fun art style, and good music. Definitely suggest this if you like thinking and smashing things. Which may not seem to go together, but let me assure you, they do, and great fun ensues as a result.			",176,45,2,17,15,1,35

												A superb, silly game. A good way of describing it is Monty Python meets Super Monkey Ball meets a small part of Tower Defence. And for the price it's at, even without a sale, it is well worth your time. Littered with history jokes (The 300 Spartans, Vlad The Impaler's level starting with a Castlevania reference and such) this game is good for a laugh, and the gameplay is solid too.

												This is a truly unique, wholly playable, and intensely fun game equipped with a strikingly original concept that carries a great deal of comedic weight. While the game may be a tad easy on normal mode, it is simply pure fun and a joy to play each time. If there's any criticism, it's that the AI have a tough time in dealing with certain modes of defense on normal mode, and are a bit easy to stop when you get into the swing of things. It doesn't stop the game from being fun, however. This is an awesome way to spend ten dollars for the value that you get: 20 stages to master against AI, multiplayer, and 2 game modes aside from story to play and enjoy. ACE studios have done a bang up job with this one, and should be applauded for their efforts.			",302,31,6,22,13,1,31

												Pretty fun little racing game.  ACE did a great job with the settings for each chapter and you get a short history lesson during the course of the game.  It's not a very long single-player campaign, but the game modes outside of the campaign along with the achievements should add a little more playtime.This is a big departure from ACE's first outing, Zeno Clash.  They've done pretty well transitioning from a shooter to a racing game.  I wish there was more to say but it's just a short racing game at its heart.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pretty simple really, you're a boulder that rolls down a slope smashing things on your way down in an effort to break the enemy gates and squash their leader. Meanwhile an enemy boulder is rolling down your slope trying to do the same thing to you. You need to build defenses such as towers, elephants, airships and ballistae to fend off the enemy boulder whilst simultaneously dodging the enemy's own defenses.There's a campaign mode and a bunch of minigames, it's quite short but there's plenty to unlock and replay, with amusing little cutscenes featuring ""Monty Python"" style humour. You can also play online, which might add an extra layer of unpredictability that the enemy AI can't replicate.The only gripe I can think of is that the boss battles felt kind of unnecessary and somewhat interrupted the flow of the game. They usually involve some sort of timing mechanic, which can be frustrating until you get the hang of the boss' attack patterns. Thankfully they don't play a major part in the game and most of the content is the regular levels.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is an all-time fun game with a lot of fun twists, people to play against, and boulders. I love this game because not only can you win and be happy as hell, you can also rage about falling off the edge over 100000 times or being crushed by the giant GIANT Mammoth in certain maps or blown to bits by the Giant Cannons.However, one thing I don't like about the game is that if you want to play Multiplayer, nobody is really playing. I spent like 10 minutes in the lobby for War, trying to find someone to play against, and even playing against AI to wait, but still, nobody joined. I wish more people would play this game and play Multiplayer because honestly it's fun as hell. I hope to play against somebody one day on the game instead of having to play alone and beat Story mode over and over again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Go get your balls to the wall man.It's a satirical game where you control an upgradable ball that smashes into cows, elephans and screaming cardboard people in an attempt to reach the gate at the end of the track, break it down, and squash the enemy player, usually represented by some historical or mythological figure, hiding behind it. If you are not entirely sure if you understand what I just said, that's fine - means you don't do drugs. If you do happen to look upon this game while under the effect of LSD or other hallucinogenic drugs, I am sure it will all make sense to you.The game mechanics are quite clever. 2 tracks, each with some branching. A gate on each end. Behind the gate - the player. Each player has a ball they must roll through the enemy track and hit the enemy gate with as much force as possible. Defence structures on the track damage the ball, breaking off it's mass. When the ball is destroyed or reaches the gate at the end, the player has some time before a new one is built to reinforce their track with defensive structures. A game ends when one player crushes another's gate and rolls over their avatar behind it.This is a fun game to play at parties, especially if you are short on weed or value your health yet still want to f*ck with people's minds. Also if you think a 4 ton stone boulder can squash a cow - you are wrong. Cow>stone. OOOOOOOOOO/10(those are balls)If this game was an accurate representation of history, it would be a pretty good representation.			",127,14,1,13,4,0,3

												This game is rediculous and makes no snese, but makes perfect sense. When call of duty, dayz, skyrim or anything else has run its course and you need a cahnge of pace, you and a friend can jump in to rock of ages and literally spend 2 hours rolling around, pushing each other's boudlers off the sky courses, tryign to get your boulder up into the buckets above the Skeeball goals, laughing HYSTERICALLY at your buddy who decided to try the square ""block of ages""And then you discover the in-game chat system..... which will pronounce anything & EVERYTHING that you've typed out into the in-game chat. Including but not limtied to ""UIWHEFUIAEVJKWRTUIVBWEGH""  ""shammalamma-ding-dong-ping-pong"" ""I am RAMBO GOD OF WAR aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"" and all your favorite 4 letter obscenities.It's worth the price of the game alone.Seriously, one of the most fun things you can do with friends on steam.

I'm too tired to continue, but we stayed up until 3am playing this absurd title.Great work to the team who made it. My only comment is that some levels seem like they're too open, so you should start with more money and time to build it up or it's a bit of a waste.Other than that, what a blast. I love the little animations. I would like to see some more polish here and there, but maybe that can happen with some DLC, or a sequel, which I would be more than happy to pay for!Buy this game!!!9/10			",128,23,1,9,11,0,11

												Rock of Ages is a platformer/race/tower defense game where you control a ball similar to games like Torquing (Funorb), Super Monkey Ball and various recent marble/ball themed puzzle games on Steam.The game is a bit silly and sometimes frustrating, but otherwise a very fun game that makes you feel achieved after beating it's challenges. It has some replayability, but (in my opinion) only in co-op as there aren't almost any players online..  and the local co-op sadly requires 2 controllers.9/10			",640,166,16,115,52,7,80

Have you ever been so historically inaccurate that you were accurate because the history books were written by the Wingardium Illumanti? Have you ever failed your history class because your teacher called you out on that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and then you dropped an exporbitant metaphoric structure on said teacher and got away with it?If you did, then you're probably the police then who are just arriving at my home to find that I'VE RIGGED THE ENTIRE BLOCK TO EXPLODE.If not, you're playing Rock of Ages, a delighfully quirky and fast paced strategy/platformer/rock-crushing simulator game and advise you to completely disregard the last paragraph or else you may be burned at the stake like that famous witch, The Crucible.

												Rock of Ages is an interesting riff on the typical strategy game. Your goal is to get your boulder to the enemies gate and crash it down. But before you control your boulder, you and your opponent are given time to set up defenses like catapults (which damage boulders) or Elephants (which can push your boulder off the map). When the set-up time expires, you can control your boulder and try to dodge your enemies defenses to get to their gate. The singleplayer campaign is split with about 90% of these ""break the opponents gate"" maps and about 10% boss battles, which really don't work as well. The game also has a 2 player VS mode, as well as a race mode where you try to get to a goal as fast as you can. The game also has a cool Monty Python animation style in its cutscenes, and it has some oddball visual humor as well. It works well in Single Player, and the AI is pretty fair, but if you want to get some more legs out of the game it's worth it to play the VS mode with a friend.			",69,16,0,8,5,0,6

												This game is very well-rounded, and an excellent source of entertainment if you get bored, can't find the motivation to start up a more complex game like Europa Universalis or Kerbal Space Program, and just want to smash something fast.That's after you beat the campaign of course, which is fun in of itself. There are three main modes a single person would be interested in, and the same for multiplayer. There's War, Obstacle Course, Time Trial, and Skeeboulder. The singleplayer campaign consists entirely of War games throughout all the maps and five different 'ages', Sparta, (characterized by orange and black clay-jar carvings as an art style) the Middle Ages, (reminds me of ancient tapestries) the Renaissance, (with both roman architecture and a lot of marble) Baroque France, (very blue, very fancy) and Spain. (a very dark and gruesome Spain, however)I still pop in almost every day to play a few rounds of obstacle course, and while the campaign won't last forever there's plenty there to play for quite some time.

												This is a truly unique, wholly playable, and intensely fun game equipped with a strikingly original concept that carries a great deal of comedic weight. While the game may be a tad easy on normal mode, it is simply pure fun and a joy to play each time. If there's any criticism, it's that the AI have a tough time in dealing with certain modes of defense on normal mode, and are a bit easy to stop when you get into the swing of things. It doesn't stop the game from being fun, however. This is an awesome way to spend ten dollars for the value that you get: 20 stages to master against AI, multiplayer, and 2 game modes aside from story to play and enjoy. ACE studios have done a bang up job with this one, and should be applauded for their efforts.			",302,31,6,22,13,1,31

												if you're familiar with the host of other, samey Rock-based titles like ""The Rockford Files"" ""Rock band"" or the abysmal ""Rock around the clock 2: Reqium"", then you'll find yourself well at home with ""Rock of Ages"" Game play wise. Eh. Its alright. Its a little off beat, sort of like a Monty Python animation mixed with tower defence and boulders. But its the story you're here for.You, Frank Rockovage, and your partner, Sysaphis McKowski (of American Gladiators fame), are hot on the trail of a mysterious gang land king pin who killed your wife three years ago and you're not about to let anything get in your way. Together you'll roll your way through the mean streets of history, wrecking the absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥out of everything you see so you can finally reap hard vengeance. As the tag line suggests, ""Crimes about to discover its trapped between a ROCK and a hard place.""three and a half boulder-based puns out of five.			",167,21,1,20,29,2,41

												It's a game where you roll giant rocks at your enemy and smash their stuff, there's really not much else that needs to be said.  This game is simple, has a great art style, and above all:  fun.  The tactical aspects of setting up your defenses in single-player to chip away at your opponent's boulder could use some refining.  It's mostly just cramming defensive structures into a few strategic points and hoping for the best.  If you can get your boulder down the range before your opponent, you've already got a big advantage.  However, rolling your own boulder towards the enemy and smashing anything in your way is great fun.This game has a great art style that compliments the feel of the game well, taking elements from art from the various ages and working them into a funny parody that left me laughing at just about every cutscene.  It's very much like the Monty Python animations.This game is definitely worth the money.			",39,36,0,6,7,1,15

												I found this game between (nicely) weird and a bit monotonous, but cannot tell why.You build traps along a course for the enemy rock to roll into, while you try to get to his gates as quickly as possible. It usually takes three times trough the course to break the enemy's gate and win the round.For me it sometimes was a bit confusing and the controls did not react as I expected... still not too bad of a game.

												Rock of Ages is kind of a mix between racing, tower defense, and bowling. You're playing, essentially, as one person building traps to place in the way of your opponent's boulder, then you roll your own boulder down their side until you smash against their gate, while trying not to get destroyed along the way. The story mode starts out pretty easy but turns surprisingly hard at one or two points once you start facing against ballistas and such. The war game mode is the meat of it, and it's a blast.I did have one or two complaints though. Firstly, the kind of humor in this game can be hit or miss, and for me it was a definite miss. Secondly, the boss segments in the story were by far the most boring parts of the entire game. It's not even clear at first what you're supposed to do, and when you do figure it out it's repetitive and dull, making you wish you could just get back to smashing open gates. Third, I kept running into a bug when resetting levels where the sky view on the war map would get stuck and refused to move until I realized it was detecting the W key as being constantly active; hitting the W key once fixed it, but it was still annoying.Apart from that, I still haven't found anyone to play multiplayer with, at least through random matching. You'll need a friend or two with the game to make that aspect work.Still, those minor complaints aside, this is a really fun game. Not one you'll sink tons of hours into, but one you'll have plenty of fun with for a while, and can come back to once in a while to relax while smashing things up with your giant rock.

												Possibly my new favorite racing game, and I don't even like racing games! Er, well, Rock of Ages is a humorous title with some stellar art (the use of classical pieces does in fact remind me of [and I know others have said this] Terry Gilliam's work) and fun gameplay. The multiplayer shines especially in obstacle course mode, which is essentially a race, and war, which mixes in a little strategy. Thus far into the game, the only irritation is that the obstacle course multiplayer only allows two players; I could see this being ridiculously fun with more players! I do recommend this game, especially if the price is low.			",249,125,2,68,21,2,45

												A lot of other reviews say what is needed, so I shal have the unusual here.Ahem,Some days you dont give one sh*t,you invite your friends to smash.When they say they dont want to,you steam gift them a bash.And then when they get casual,you manage to kick thier *ss.You crush their defences so much,they ask if we could play smash.While I sat it up they stole my TV, XBOX, money, desktop, wife, table, tea, and staplers.Rocks made me go bankrupt.Ok, better be serious too.This game is a unusual blast! So unique but so fun, I got comfortable with the tower defence and LOVED pulling some parkour as the rock. Defending takes some thought and planning ahead, while you just roll as a rock, past or ramming your enemy defences, thats your choice. Try it out, I think you will enjoy yourself if you like some tower defence and... whater the rock is.			",176,27,2,7,22,2,6

												Great little time waster with a mix of tower defence and roll your boulder down a hill to literally crush your opponent. Single player sees you squishing several proponents through the ages, upgrading your defenses and boulder buffs as you progress, with some of the weirdest boss battles ever. There are also time trials, online battles and races; however, online opponents might take some finding nowadays, but are still out there.The game is knocking on a bit now, but still its cheap and fun with simple mechanics, and steamified too.

												This game is full of charm, its not the best game ever made but it was enjoyable in small doses. The developers behind this game are very creative and full of imagination and that to me is the most important part in video game development. As much as I enjoyed rock of ages, it is still nowhere near as immersive or as engrossing as Zeno clash, the fps brawler they made before this game. I give this game a 7/10 for innovation and imagination and its price tag, I would give it more but the repetitive gameplay only allowed me to enjoy it in small doses. I am looking forward to future projects from ACE team.			",345,19,3,21,2,2,6

I'm too tired to continue, but we stayed up until 3am playing this absurd title.Great work to the team who made it. My only comment is that some levels seem like they're too open, so you should start with more money and time to build it up or it's a bit of a waste.Other than that, what a blast. I love the little animations. I would like to see some more polish here and there, but maybe that can happen with some DLC, or a sequel, which I would be more than happy to pay for!Buy this game!!!9/10			",128,23,1,9,11,0,11

												I saw some YouTube videos of this game when it first came out and it's been on my list to get for a while. Got it super cheap during the summer sale and now I wish I had spent more on it. If you love 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' then this definitely belongs in your library. If you also like tower defense games where you are also the attacker, this is a pretty cool game. There are a few pretty challenging levels early on, so it definitely doesn't mess around despite it's humorous exterior.			",138,59,2,19,41,2,19

All in all a ""Rock-solid"" game!The gameplay involves you placing defenses down at the price of gold while your enemy does the same. Then a boulder is prepared for you to roll along the enemies path, all the way to their door, so that you may crush thine foe with a satisfying splat.10/10			",123,32,3,12,8,0,4

												Rock of Ages is simple and silly, but in a good way. It feels like being dropped into the interlude of a Monty Python skit. I would recommend playing this when having a bad day. It's is amuzing and you get to roll a boulder over people and buildings. A sure release of stress.			",104,31,5,23,12,0,12

												Rock of ages a great game. It has multiple fun modes and a hilarious art style that make it stand out. It came out in 2011 but it still has great graphics. The only problem is that not much people play this game so its hard to go on multiplayer. The majority of players got it in 2011 when it was on sale but this great game needs more players. The game is amazing but it can get a little repetitive.I got the game after watching Total Biscuit and Jack septic eye playing it. My final problem of the game is that it can be less enjoyable if you don't have a high end computer. It is slightly laggy and the graphics aren't as great but its still a good gameI rate it a 9/10 and all it lacks are some more players and maybe a sequel or an expansion.It is unlikely there will be a expansion since it's so old but a sequel would be great and the game would become popular quickly it is also 6.99 which is a bit expensive but if you have extra money to spend get this game its worth it.

												Archangel Michael slew a dragon, then proceeded to party down, until I flattened him with a flaming boulder/10.Easily the best historical figure flattening simulation I've ever had the pleasure of playing.  Escape hell and impose your boulder-enforced will on some of historys most memorable figures.  Either that, or run time trials with a STONE CUBE.Lots of fun.  The art style is funny - based on classical art, animated ala Monty Python, telling ridiculous stories with wry humor.  If you don't know, go find out why we all ate Robin's minstrel.It's like a racing game whose key mechanic is control lag.  That's a positive, by the way.  You are, after all, Sisyphus.The novelty may wear out, but those impossible boulder leaps and terrified squeals of epic characters still amuse. ",16,8,0,11,8,0,6

												When I bought a game about a rolling boulder, I knew it would either suck bad or be amazing. This game is amazing. Seriously... best one I've bought yet. (And I've played expensive ones). The game designers must have been eating some serious mushrooms to come up with this clever and fun game. Bravo!			",20,4,3,0,3,0,0

												Wow. What an amazing little game for the $0.99 paid. Waaaay too cheap for hours of fun. I'm too tired to continue, but we stayed up until 3am playing this absurd title.Great work to the team who made it. My only comment is that some levels seem like they're too open, so you should start with more money and time to build it up or it's a bit of a waste.Other than that, what a blast. I love the little animations. I would like to see some more polish here and there, but maybe that can happen with some DLC, or a sequel, which I would be more than happy to pay for!Buy this game!!!9/10			",128,23,1,9,11,0,11

												I saw some YouTube videos of this game when it first came out and it's been on my list to get for a while. Got it super cheap during the summer sale and now I wish I had spent more on it. If you love 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' then this definitely belongs in your library. If you also like tower defense games where you are also the attacker, this is a pretty cool game. There are a few pretty challenging levels early on, so it definitely doesn't mess around despite it's humorous exterior.			",138,59,2,19,41,2,19

												I REALLY enjoyed this game. There should be a sequel or at least an expansion pack!!Pros:- It's such a unique concept- The music is really awesome- The game makes me laugh - There is a ton of replayability because of the different game modes, as well as possible defenses you can experiment with in the campaign mode.- The artwork is really cool- The sound FX crack me up- Gameplay mechanics are really good- Great level design- Controls are easy- TRICK JUMPS!!!!Cons:- Obstacle course mode is way too easy- Enemy rock AI needs to have difficulty levels and be improved (this is the main reason why obstacle course mode is way too easy)- There's a bug that screws up camera/controls after many relaunches in time trial mode leading to needing to restart the level again from the time trial menu <-- this is minor- Finding yourself in the time trial universal scores list for each level is difficult <-- this is minor- Catapults are a bit OP and/or some units take up too many squares, which sort of forces the player to stick to finding a pinch point and creating a blockade of towers with catapults behind them on harder maps because each of these only takes up 1 square <-- This can make the game a little bit monotonous, but on the flip side it may encourage more experimentation with different defenses on another playthrough so I'm 50/50 on this one.All in all though this game is seriously awesome, quirky and heavily addictive fun that will see you finishing it in only a few sittings, so I wholeheartedly recommend it!!!

												I thuroughly enjoyed this game, mainly because of its unique simplisticness. I mean, what other game allows you to send a boulder down to crush random stuff and release your tention/stress while also at times building upon it(besides Giant Boulder of Death, which I have not played nor care to). Sure, sometimes having a more complex, ""interesting"" game is better, but sometimes a simple game is more interesting and fun, especially with the interesting art style of 2d/3d, which gives it sort of a unique feel. All in all, if you don't find simple, fun games enjoyable, then this isn't for you, obviously, but if you do feel like giving this a try, I would HIGHLY recommend this.			",90,7,1,8,23,3,34

Also need to collect keys to unlock the bosses so you can go to the next lot of levels. all in all it is a good game and most of the time it is in sale so buy when in sale.the game is about 5 hours long .

												Rock of Ages is a fun little game of rolling a ball downhill past enemy units and defenses in an attempt to smash down their castle gate, while building your own defenses to prevent their ball from doing the same to your castle. And sadly, that's about it, with one major exception, the Monty-Python-like cutscenes before and after each match. The rest is just varied levels without too much to break it up in between. It can be fun to come back to, but it's also rather difficult, so your mileage may very. Decent controls and setup though, however it needs more you can do to defend and attack, more depth in general. 6/10			",257,74,5,20,26,3,26

												I recommend this game for casuals who are trying to get into tower defense games, however I feel that the tower D/boulder mix didn't work so well as a puzzle, specially for people who are veterans in this type of game. I played only single player, the multiplayer might be fun tho.You see, I must have played 20 or something maps from the campaign. It didn't take much ingenuity, just speed with the boulder. Some maps required some tower building, but I never felt challenged in any aspect. Basically I didn't get that satisfaction when you build a really good defense on tower defense games.This game gets a ""yes"" from me specially because it tries something new and has great humor in it, despite not achieving the greatest polish in gameplay.

												... What can be said about Rock of Ages? If I could describe this game in one word, it would be ""silly"". In the next few lines, you'll understand why.The plot/concept of this game is a unique take on the famous Greek myth of Sisyphus, a man condemned to Tartarus and punished to roll a boulder up a hill that keeps rolling back down for all eternity. In this game, Sisyphus has had enough, and uses his accursed boulder to escape and flatten all of time itself. From then on, it becomes a cross between a Ski-Ball game and a Tower Defense, in which you are sent to different courses modeled after different historical figures and are challenged to squish them. Gameplay is divided between two turns: Construction and Rolling. During the Construction phase, you can put up obstacles with earned points to slow down and impede your opponent's boulder, by either blocking the way or knocking them off course. Rolling Phase has you roll your boulder down the opponent's course (which has also been furnished with defenses), and break down the doors to squish your opponent. Like I said. Silly.Sure, this game can get repetitive at times, but it's still a fun little bit of weirdness to lighten up your day. Plus, every level begins and ends with 'Dies Irae' and 'Ode to Joy'. It's quirky good fun, and a fun challenge to boot. I give this game a 7/10 recommendation, just for some jolly good fun. Besides: where else can you crush Leonardo Da Vinci with a smiling boulder?

												If Marble Madness were made by Monty Python, this would be the delightful result.It may look like a goofy indie game - and let's be clear, it absolutely is - but that by no means makes Rock of Ages a bad game. There's action, strategy, comedy and a bombastic classical soundtrack that brilliantly complements the zany nature of the game.			",182,47,5,44,48,5,72

												Rock of Ages is a really simple game. You have some giant balls, your opponent has some giant balls and roll at each other in the hope that you can break them before they break you. All the while various figures and events from European history prance across the screen in their attempt to amuse you. I'm a bit worried about going on even more about the game since I do want to over think the entire experience. The game's price might be a bit high given than its been released for a few years now so I might recommend that you wait for it to go on sale like I did, but I can safely say that even without a sale the single player experience in the game is totally worth it.If you want to read a more detailed review you can find it here: http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2014/09/rock-of-ages.html.

												Everyone must play this game at least once before they die. Extremely silly, funny and enjoyable little indie game. It has a certain Monty Pythonesque humour and it does induce some strong desire to crush everything, that's basically all you ever need to know about this game.The gameplay is pretty easy and simple, you control a massive boulder with WASD keys and jump over or towards things with Spacebar. Your objective is usually to destroy the enemy's gates and crush the git into a gooey mess. And in the meantime you can build some defenses to slow down enemy's boulder such as catapults, cows, elephants, towers and fans. You can also upgrade your boulder with the money you make from destroying things. There are of course bonus levels and boss fights too. It's all good fun. The game also supports multiplayer, haven't gotten into that so I can't say much.If you want a small, cheap and fun game to waste some time and have a laugh, this would be definitely the best game to go for.

												Great little time waster with a mix of tower defence and roll your boulder down a hill to literally crush your opponent. Single player sees you squishing several proponents through the ages, upgrading your defenses and boulder buffs as you progress, with some of the weirdest boss battles ever. There are also time trials, online battles and races; however, online opponents might take some finding nowadays, but are still out there.The game is knocking on a bit now, but still its cheap and fun with simple mechanics, and steamified too.

												Rock of Ages is kind of a mix between racing, tower defense, and bowling. You're playing, essentially, as one person building traps to place in the way of your opponent's boulder, then you roll your own boulder down their side until you smash against their gate, while trying not to get destroyed along the way. The story mode starts out pretty easy but turns surprisingly hard at one or two points once you start facing against ballistas and such. The war game mode is the meat of it, and it's a blast.I did have one or two complaints though. Firstly, the kind of humor in this game can be hit or miss, and for me it was a definite miss. Secondly, the boss segments in the story were by far the most boring parts of the entire game. It's not even clear at first what you're supposed to do, and when you do figure it out it's repetitive and dull, making you wish you could just get back to smashing open gates. Third, I kept running into a bug when resetting levels where the sky view on the war map would get stuck and refused to move until I realized it was detecting the W key as being constantly active; hitting the W key once fixed it, but it was still annoying.Apart from that, I still haven't found anyone to play multiplayer with, at least through random matching. You'll need a friend or two with the game to make that aspect work.Still, those minor complaints aside, this is a really fun game. Not one you'll sink tons of hours into, but one you'll have plenty of fun with for a while, and can come back to once in a while to relax while smashing things up with your giant rock.

The game is filled top to bottom with humorous touches, and it still manages to be very strategic without compremising the silliness of it's core mechanic. On top of that, it has a great art style. Once you get past the first level it lacks a proper tutorial, but the mechanics are easy to pick up even without proper instuctions. For the price, it's a great value.			",337,89,4,34,33,3,53

Imagine Extreme Bobsled Bowling with a Monty Python Cardboard Cutout story.Plus it is only $2.50 this weekend.  You can't go wrong with that.			",718,200,27,70,58,7,110

												Overall, this is a very creative tower defense game. The cutscenes are pretty funny (think Terry Gilliam cartoons from Monty Python.) The different types of tools available to slow down your enemy are also pretty good. If you are a fan of tower defense games, id highly recommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												True stupid fun is the game that lets you smash s**t with a really big rock. This isn't the RPGs we've come to expect from Atlus, but this game definitly doesnt dissipoint. At first you get the vibe of pinball, but soon come to find that this is so much more. Sorta tower defense, sorta Marbel Madness (i'm not the only one who remembers that arcade gem, am i?)This game is simple in the ways you directly play, but can get complex with how you set up your passive defenses and handle enemy rolls. +Really unique gameplay+unique 2D and interesting 3D graphics+History... sort of+constantly adding unique item upgrades+Prety adiquite tutorial-Not much in the way of story7/10			",332,51,2,45,15,2,17

All in all a ""Rock-solid"" game!The gameplay involves you placing defenses down at the price of gold while your enemy does the same. Then a boulder is prepared for you to roll along the enemies path, all the way to their door, so that you may crush thine foe with a satisfying splat.10/10			",123,32,3,12,8,0,4

												Rock of Ages is a unique game with more to offer in fun and challenge than you may expect. I really enjoy its silly sense of humor. That sense of humor takes the edge off of what would sometimes be too frustrating of a challenge. The game starts off relatively easy, but the difficulty ramps up quickly. I haven't tried multiplayer yet, but I imagine it would be alot of fun to play this against a friend or family member.I would definitely recommend this game. It's a nice, unique addition to your games collection that probably isn't like anything else that you have.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I change my vote about the game. The first time I played the story mode. the game was like a torture to me. It was really painful playin' it. No kidding so unbearable to the point I left it unfinished for weeks. (Honestly, I don't know exactly why, maybe because the humor doesn't suit me, or the way the rock move annoy me, or the sound when the rock move, or when the rock fall, or all the high-pitched screams, the obstacles, the gameplay, or maybe all of them) Time passed. I gave the game another chance. and the results:[+] I enjoyed playing the time-trial mode,[+] I also enjoyed collecting keys, and the achievements,[+] more than 30 unique levels to be played [-] I still didn't enjoy playin the story mode, [-] >30 levels in the story mode,[-] no multiplayer online,.[-] =/= 100%Overall actually the game is not that bad.

Campaing is fun to play because of funny cutscenes and funny characters. I bought it long time ago in sale and I am happy that I did. Its really relaxing and maybe little rage game (Sometimes :D). I am really hoping that there will be something like Rock of Ages 2 with more mods to play and 4 player online game. :)Nice and funny game, good to play with a friend.8.75/10			",93,10,1,12,6,0,15

												I've sorted this game into my 'Arcade' section of my steam library because it reminds me of just that: a souped-up Marble Madness. There is a lot more to it, including tower defense and RTS mechanics, but it doesn't every feel like you've moved beyond the simple jump-and-roll mechanic... which is a good thing. Rather, those components of gameplay just feel like accoutrements to enhance your experiences.Not enough can be said about the art style of ACE Studios' games though; you might hate the Monty Pythonesque humor but I enjoy the unique setting they always give their games.

Spike reviews his 100%-ed gamesIn one sentence…Rolling a ball to destroy gates, also involves aerial projectiles, cows, demons, Michelangelo, trollface, mumbling, cardboards and remnants of Hannibals army (in short, an ACE game)In more words…Another ACE game, so another game hard to describe. You roll with a boulder downwards to a gate which you have to ram. Destroying things along the way gives you currency, which you can spend to improve your boulder, or create obstacles for the enemy who is rolling it's own boulder on an identical track, to destroy ""your"" gate. The enemy naturally places obstacles on the track you are rolling on. Does that make sense? First one to destroy the gate wins te level. The whole game is set in a Monty Python esque world, so that's a love-it-hate-it kinda thing - but I for one loved it. There are some fun achievements, good amount of content, a fantastic soundtrack... Get this if you're even slightly interested.			",294,65,1,18,35,1,40

												A very silly and very fun game about rolling boulders on an obstacle course to destroy your opponents base. Each person places defenses to protect their base while rolling their boulder towards the other one's base. Not a complex premise, which makes it very easy to jump right in. The single player storyline is very humourous and the visuals are Monty Python-esque and quite comical. Overall, a great little game to sink a bit of time into here and there.8/10 - IT ROCKS ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Go get your balls to the wall man.It's a satirical game where you control an upgradable ball that smashes into cows, elephans and screaming cardboard people in an attempt to reach the gate at the end of the track, break it down, and squash the enemy player, usually represented by some historical or mythological figure, hiding behind it. If you are not entirely sure if you understand what I just said, that's fine - means you don't do drugs. If you do happen to look upon this game while under the effect of LSD or other hallucinogenic drugs, I am sure it will all make sense to you.The game mechanics are quite clever. 2 tracks, each with some branching. A gate on each end. Behind the gate - the player. Each player has a ball they must roll through the enemy track and hit the enemy gate with as much force as possible. Defence structures on the track damage the ball, breaking off it's mass. When the ball is destroyed or reaches the gate at the end, the player has some time before a new one is built to reinforce their track with defensive structures. A game ends when one player crushes another's gate and rolls over their avatar behind it.This is a fun game to play at parties, especially if you are short on weed or value your health yet still want to f*ck with people's minds. Also if you think a 4 ton stone boulder can squash a cow - you are wrong. Cow>stone. OOOOOOOOOO/10(those are balls)If this game was an accurate representation of history, it would be a pretty good representation.			",127,14,1,13,4,0,3
