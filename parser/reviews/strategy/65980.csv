												A lot of reviews state that Beyond Earth is ""unfinished"", ""unpolished"", and similar words and phrases. And in many ways, they're correct. But there's a slightly more insidious truth to the statement as well.Start up Civ V with all of the DLC expansions and play through a game. It's well-balanced, deep, intricate, and takes a good amount of effort and understanding to make it work. Now start up Civ V WITHOUT any of the DLC expansions.Drastically different game, isn't it? Suddenly the balancing is gone, the depth has disappeared, even the use of culture points is different. You're playing something that seems... unfinished. Unpolished. Broken. It's not the full game yet.That is what I feel is happening with Beyond Earth. It's not just the standard glitches and problems that every launch title ends up having, it's that people are comparing it to Civ V with the DLC, and not Civ V as it was when it initially came out. And it's an unfair comparison.Beyond Earth is not a bad game when judged on its own merits. The graphics are clean, the tech tree is deep, the bugs (both literal and figurative) are not overwhelming. There are definitely aspects that need work; the interface is drastically in need of an overhaul, the civilopedia is missing critical information on some of the structures, some things are never explained at all, and there are graphical glitches here and there among the prettiness. But unfortunately it's never going to be judged on its own merits. It's going to be judged against Alpha Centauri (which, let's face it, people are viewing through rose-colored glasses) and against Civ V.Having said all of that, though... the fact that we're going to be forced to wait for DLC in order to have a great game instead of merely a finished one does not lend itself to much of a positive review. So even though I still feel that Beyond Earth is being unfairly maligned, I cannot in good faith recommend purchasing it in the form it is now. At least not at full price.Wait until the next sale, or even better wait until the first DLC and then get them both on sale.			",245,83,6,74,42,3,68

												This bun left the oven far too early. Not worth $50 and if they charge $30 for the first ""expansion"", they'll have a very irritated customer (who will probably buy it anyway, argh).Good:- Feels like Civ5 (it is)- Tech Tree is less linear- Affinities are interesting and change gameplay styles (or fit your favorite style)- Lots of building options... (though this becomes a scrolling nightmare later in the game)- The Virtue ""table"" is interesting and helps you tailor your civ- Wonder are less epic, but more numerous- Much more difficult early in the game to capture capital cities (militarily you're quite weak early on)Bad:- Feels like a Civ5 mod (and not a super deep one either)- UI and gameplay mechanics have gone backwards badly (some simple things in Civ5 are missing here)- UI that is standard in many other 4x titles is not here (click on cities in a city list and going to the city, etc.)- Massive micromanagement issues (trade units regularly require mindless retasking just to do the same action)- Diplomacy is useless (they've had years to come up with a better system and it still stinks)- Aliens are an afterthought after a few levels in Affinity (as your units get tougher)- Factions are weak (essentially just a way to give different bonuses) with little personality- Terrain coloring/graphics leave many things an indistinguishable mash (is that basalt? a crashed satellite? titanium?)- Quests are easily achieved and after a few playthroughs are ignored (you'll likely complete them by accident)- Spying system is very one-dimensional, gets very repetitive/annoying after a while (""fine, siphon energy again. ugh.)- Endgame is an afterthought. ""You win."" No score, no ratings board, no comparisons, etc.If you're a Civ5 fan, wait until they have an expansion or two under their belt and this goes on sale. Right now you're buying a slap-dash game that misses most of the beauty and fun of Civ5 and doesn't add enough of the new...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The vanilla version was underwhelming. So much so that the developers basically apologized and said they would put out a 2.0 upgrade to bring it up to their original expectations. Now months later, they've decided that everything that was going into the free upgrade will now be part of the first DLC pack that will cost almost as much as the game did.Don't bother wasting your money until all the DLC is out and you can get it bundled and on sale for $15.

												A technically polished, but otherwise soulless, modification to the Civilization V engine.   While it tries to take its cues from 1999's fantastic Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri (SMAC), it lacks all personality and spark that made SMAC special.It's not a bad game, it just never gets out of second gear.  Dissapointing given Firaxis's history.   Maybe expansions will help the game (as they did with Civ V), but I can't give Beyond Earth a recommendation as-is and at full AAA price.The good stuff:  - Novel try at a ""three dimensional"" tech tree.- An orbital map layer where you can deploy satellites.- Crisp graphics and inventive alien design.- A clever new social policy ""talent tree"" that awards going wide as well as deep.  Underwhelming stuff:  - Very limited unit selection and customization.- Bland AI whose only difficulty comes from production and gameplay bonuses.- Diplomatic screens ripped right from Civ V.  They didn't even bother to rewrite the flavor text.- The affinity system.  It tries to organicly grow your culture in the form of a pure human, cybernetic singularity, or human/alien hybrid civilization.   Unfortunately, you have to commit very early to one of these affinities, so it ends up being a forced and uninteresting choice.  - Uninspiring technology quotes.  You'll miss SMAC's philosophy and witty commentary. ",145,27,2,28,24,2,36

												People described this game as a mod for Civilization 5 and I can see where they are coming from. The way the game plays and the interface are mostly the same and it has all the same windows (diplomacy, economic overview, etc.). Most of the changes are on the surface level: gold has been replaced by energy, social policies by virtues and archers by rangers.The main shortfall of CivBE is that is has no character/personality. The maps and menus look bland and your opponents are completely interchangeable. Another thing that's missing is context. You know about Hiawatha and the Iroquois and what a lighthouse is, but you don't know who Élodie is and what a xenomass well does.All in all, this would have been a GREAT mod for Civ5, but as a standalone game it doesn't compare well to it's bigger brother.If you didn't play Civ5, play that instead. If you have played Civ5, this feels like a step back.			",32,2,0,5,6,0,6

												NOTICE: I have not played the Rising Tides expansion. It seems pretty cool, but my review is more focused towards vanilla Beyond Earth.It took a lot of DLC and updates to make Civ V what it is now. It also took huge bundle deals on expansions to make the game worth the cost. I love Civ V, by the way.I don't hate BE. I just don't think it'll be worth playing until it's more polished and has more content. Even then, I would never recommend buying day 1. Just wait until the expansions are included and everything is on sale. It's essentially the same deal as Civ V was.""but the company has to get money somehow!""Yeah, well, make a better product. Make me WANT to buy right away.			",49,7,0,12,3,0,5

Posted: March 19, 2015
												Alright, here is the lowdown.I had been anticipating this game since it had been announced. I also had played a bit of alpha centauri, so I was interested to see where this game would go.The Good:- Some of the issues with 1UPT have been solved. I am still not a fan, but floating units helps you siege cities easier, which as somebody who has 500+ hours in civ (playing emperor/immortal)  I appreciate this greatly. This effect comes in more late game. - Cities don't get built instantly, which is great. I think we can all agree that it is annoying when you are 1 tile away from a settler who makes a city right before you get to him, and now suddenly, you have to come back with an army. Instead, they have an outpost, which is far easier to assault. This prevents the computer and other players from making low-risk, high reward cities all the time. They have to actually consider where they are building this outpost and defending it.- The Tech web is very unique, and doesn't really force you into one direction. (although skipping out on spy tech at the beginning is truly shooting yourself in the foot)- This game has FAR MORE depth than civ V did at release, and still more depth than CiV V after Gods and kings.- Aliens are interesting in that they can be passive, or aggressive depending on how you deal with them. (This could use some more fine tuning. (Simply having Green, Light Green, Orange, and Red as aggression markers is not enough, give us more tiers, we need to be informed of exactly how much they feel aggressive to be able to act accordingly)-Tier bonuses within the Virtue tree allow you to go accross the tree as oppose to just choosing one, and being forced to stick with it.- The spy system is far more relevant than in Civ V, and cannot be ignored completely. This could be improved further though. (They could give you more choices of what to do)- The three different ideologies are awesome, they all go in their own path and have their own playstyle. Unfortunately, in Multiplayer I inherit the Ideologies of my allies, which makes no sense to me. I think there should be an option to turn this off at least.- Runs almost as well as Civ V.- The technology announcer is a woman, unfortunately this means Civ Guy's voice is gone. So you don't get to hear him tell you ""You have discovered COMPASS"" Kinda sad, hehe, but I love the woman's voice even better.The Bad-Totally uninspired maps. It seems like the concern here was that players wouldn't be able to understand that a land is fertile unless it is a green grass land. Come on Firaxis, I think we are smarter than that, or else I don't think Civ would appeal to us.- The landscape is completely like a re-colored Civ V, and is far too afraid to venture into sci-fi at all. It tries to hard to provide us with an easy way to understand the game from the first time we pick it up, and make us feel at home. Unfortunately this causes the land to look incredibly bland, and the color pallet is horrid, it is green, purple, and brown.- Both of these issues come from the conservative approach that they seem to have take for this game, Make it easy, simple to understand. They were afraid to take risks, FAR too afraid. Look at alpha centauri, they were bold when they made that game, that game had personality; which leads me to my next point.- I play this game, and I don't really see any type of personality to it. It is a blank slate, just  a video game on a screen, no story, no basic theme. They tried to give you the idea that you lead your own future, but instead it just feels like they didn't give the game any spirit. (Maybe adding more themes for each ideology, and unique buildings would give you more of a feeling that your nation has become unique. ( A good example of this is Civ V, when you played civ you feel like nations strive for glory, and we look at the accomplishments of civilizations. In Civ BE it feels like you like land on a planet, and they tell you. OK, go tell your story. (that's it...)- Teching up in the beginning is VERY SLOW. It pick ups rather fast once you get to the mid late game. But at the beginning, MY GOD, it is slow. I usually play standard on CIV V, but this feels 3 to 4 times as slow when it comes to teching. Maybe the way the game was designed required this, I myself am not sure if I buy this.- The 1 UPT, although somewhat improved, is still an issue. This issue could be solved if they allowed siege units to fire above hills/forests. I guess they forget how to do that on the way over to Alpha Centauri... Seriously, I understand the distinction between Realism, and gameplay. But let my damn artillery fire 3 tiles away, even if it is for reduced damage. This will open up options for people, maybe let you have elongated sieges. Whether this is for gameplay purposes, or realism purposes, i don't get why artillery fire only 2 hexes away in the beginning.-Religion is gone. I for one understand why this isn't in the game YET. But it needs to make a re-appearance, this was an aspect of the game that gave Civ V depth. This may have been cut because of the 1/3 rule they have at firaxis. From game to game,they removed 1/3rd of the freatures, and replace 1/3rd. They are so afraid to overburden us with features, but guess what Firaxis? If you want us to stay fans of your game, you have to add a bit of depth(as our mastery increases), or else your fans get tired of your games.- The map packs aren't distinct, i can't really even remember which one looks like when looking at the map list. I know they have to consider balance when making maps, but these maps have very little to nothing unique about them. At least change up the color pallet, make us feel like we are on a different planet. I just feel like we are on a different version of the same planet every single time I play.- The wonders make no sense, and aren't even drawn out. It's like they expect you to fill in the colors with your mind. Just have one of your awesome artists draw up something futuristic and awesome. We don't need to fill in every single part of the game with our imagination, give us a base idea or image to work with. Not the quickly drawn up blueprint of a wonder that wasn't even explained properly.- There is very little Alien diversity. I think there are about 4 aliens, and they are the same 4 in every single map. (2 water aliens for a total of 6) Still, it isn't enough, they should vary, they should be part of the equation when you start the game.The suggestions- Give us an intro for each victory, that would be awesome, and help build the ""story"" that Firaxis wants to help build in our minds.-Give us more uniqueness for each Ideology.- Provide us with more ideologies in the long run.- Bring back religion, and add some depth to it if possible. (Find a way to make it work.)-Please...Please, please... re-work the maps, they look terribly boring, the color pallet is horrid, and they are the opposite of inspiring.-Bring some scifi into this, give us farmable deserts, habitable mountains, ocean cities, floating cities. Give us something original, ANYTHING. Make us dream of the future. I believe Firaxis can achieve this while keeping the game balanced.- Bring randomized aliens into the game. Have a type of alien species that spawn randomly at the beginning of the game. Depending on what it is, you can adjust your strategy. - Extend the benefits and possibilities that you have when you go beyond level 13 of an affinity. Let it change our civilization even more, and maybe give more benefits.All in all, the game is good, pretty good, but not great. It needs something more, and it needs to be daring.The hours speak for themselves : Civ V (500 hours) Civ BE 54 hoursI recommend this game based on the fact that this game is good enough, and I believe firaxis can fix most of their faults. I doubt they will fix everything though, only time will tell.			",86,16,0,10,10,0,16

												Update:  As of the first major patch, the game is certainly playable.  I still wouldn't recommend it based on the poor creative direction.  The game just needs a lot of extra seasoning.  I can't lie, I've been playing it a lot lately, and it's just damned solid mechanically, and despite the similarities to Civ 5, it actually plays a lot differently on the meta strategy level.  None of this couldn't be done by very creative modders, however, and the real meat of a AAA game is in the art budget, of which BE clearly had very little.I've been looking forward to this game for months.  So this review hurts to write.As a HUGE fan of science-fiction, Civilization, and the Civ 5 engine, I feel obligated to write this review.  It is very, very hard for me to not give this game a general recommendation.Let me preface it by saying it's not going to be bubbly fan-squealing, or one-dimensional vitriol.  I have legitimate issues with Beyond Earth - serious ones!Does that mean I'm not playing it?  No, it doesn't.  I'm enough of a nerd to love the game despite its failings.Here's the rundown:The game takes to the Civ 5 engine like a duck to water.  Yes, a lot of the various aspects of it are transparently reskinned (energy is gold, happiness is health, etc.)  A lot of the mechanics, such as diplomacy and trade, are just flat out identical to how they are in Civ 5 and its various expansions.  Is that a bad thing?  I don't think so, because Civ 5 did a lot of things right.Let's just condense this.  It's a great base game.  It's a game that I can play and enjoy and then think ""wow, I can't wait until this gets expansions and becomes truly amazing.""  In that sense, it reminds me of Civ 5 at release, way back when.  I liked Civ 5 at release.  But it didn't grip me.  That all changed when Gods and Kings came out.  The vast majority of my Civ 5 playtime is post G&K.  I suspect it'll be the same for Beyond Earth.Unfortunately this is just how Firaxis seems to do things now.  They release a really solid, if bare and vanilla, base game for the flat fee.  Then they release thirty dollar expansions that are AMAZING additions.  They wouldn't do it if it didn't work.  Here are some things I just can't excuse, though, and I think really detract from the value of a full-price purchase:- Very little automation.  I have no problem with micro-management.  But when that micromanagement becomes clicking my poor old fingers into early arthritis just to refresh trade routes, I get irritated.  It was annoying in BNW, it's annoying here.  And where are city governors?  This game should have improved upon Civ 5's shortcomings, not just reskinned the whole thing, annoyances and all.-Graphical glitches.  Units getting stuck in the upgrade windows and plastering over each other.  Visual artifacts.  Etc.  Will be ironed out.  Not game-breaking in the least, just annoying.-Sound glitches.  Sometimes when achieving a new affinity level, and a new technology, the quotes stutter or lay over each other, or jostle for priority.  It's distracting and annoying.- Boring leaders.  I like Kavitha a lot.  But I play as her, so I don't get to see her much.  I have to be subjected to all the boring, rigid, starched sads that run the other factions (except for the PAC leader, she really gets into it sometimes).  Alpha Centauri had strong, charismatic, intriguing characters for the individual factions.  The leaders in this game seem sedate compared to them, and especially compared to the colorful, bombastic characters littered through Civ 5.- Boring factions in general.  Half the fun of Civ 5 was having your own special war and peace themes as a civ.  Identifying with the strong personality and values of your chosen civ, etc.  There is very little to attach to in Beyond Earth, because all of the leaders are relatively sedated and dull.  They don't even get unique backgrounds or music.- Limited visual representation of technology progression.  It's there, sure.  Clothes on your fellow leaders change.  You can see some cybernetics later.  I haven't seen what they look like at the maximum affinity level (18), maybe it's extreme.  It would be cool to be able to look at your own leader and see how they change visually as you progress, but you can't. - Boring-as-♥♥♥♥-wonders.  Each wonder in Civ 5 had a dramatic quote, a beautiful piece of art, and its own brief symphonic score to herald its completion.  In Beyond Earth we get some dull, lifeless blueprint picture, no real musical cue, and a simple quote.  I also can't see them on the landscape like I could in Civ - no wait, I can see some of them.  They're just hard to catch sometimes.All in all, the game just lacks polish and TLC.  And that's what separates a AAA title for $50-60 from everything else.  You expect a certain level of polish and refinement, and a lot of that comes from attention to detail in the art and writing departments.  You progress through astounding leaps and bounds of technology, yet the sense of impact from those accomplishments is minimal thanks to the slashed art, music, and writing budgets.So, in terms of just artistic polish, the game is a huge disappointment compared to every other Civ title and Alpha Centauri.  It lacks the personality and charm Firaxis usually brings to the table.  What gives?I don't know.  We can only really speculate.  But it's sad, and ultimately, kind of kills the experience for me.I only recommend this game to hardcore Civ fans who just love a good strategy romp.  It's still fun to play.  It just isn't very satisfying in the end.  To everyone else, I say just avoid it until the first expansion comes out and the price drops, unless you truly don't care about art, or character, or music, and only want the numbers and the game itself.Hopefully in the future we'll see more victory conditions, religion mechanics, psionics, another affinity, new factions, new leaders, better art,  better music, better expensive non-gamey stuff that publishers hate to fund.Hopefully.

												Sadly, as many other reviewers before me have said, this game had potential. Firaxis decided to milk it like they did with Civ V and put it out unfinished. Even the developer knew it was a mess and apologized for the poor, and bland, gameplay. So they decided to fix it, and instead of patching the game, they've turned it into a $30 DLC, 30 DOLLARS!? There are better games out there being sold complete for 15 bucks. An absolute travesty that this is what the gaming industry has come to. Do NOT buy this game or the DLC until it is complete and ""on sale"" for what it's worth in the first place. Only by putting our money where our mouth is will the gaming industry wake up and realize that you can't buy a good reputation, you have to earn it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

If you haven't played Civilization 5, I recommend you doing so first, since it's a much more complete game with it's DLC and the price tag is way below this one.The past Civilization games are pretty much just upgrades of each other, but with Civilization: Beyond Earth, the developers have thought different. This time the ""story"" takes place after you launch the rocket in Civilization 5 to search for a new place for humanity to continue it's living. The game includes new creatures and a new life beyond earth. I really like the new thinking and the idea of this game, it's a step in the right direction. However, this game could have been alot better, it's not on the same level as the rest of the Civilization franchise, yet. I don't feel like paying another $40, 3 times, for DLC, I want the game to be good on release due to the price tag of $60. To be honest, I do not recommend this game to anyone, atleast not in the current state and it's price tag, but some free DLC makes no harm huh? I still belive in this game, and I'm looking forward to play this game when it's in a more finished state.Overall this game is just overhyped due to the fact that Civilization 5 was such a great game.

												Writing a negative review for a Civilization game is something I never thought I'd do.  I was even someone who defended Civilization V at release due to the benefits of hex tiles and no unit stacking far outweighing the drawback of somewhat simplified game systems.  In this case however, they have taken the simplification to absurd levels and made a game so 2-dimensional, I simply can't believe that Firaxis produced it.I suppose I should start with the positives, though there's only one.  The social policy system from Civilization V has been rearranged so there are 4 policy trees each with 3 tiers and upgraded with tier and tree bonuses.  Putting a certain number of points in a tier across all trees, or a certain number of points into a particular tree will net you an additional bonus.  It's still a very static system though, and makes me miss the customizable government system from Alpha Centauri.Moving onto the negatives we have just about everything else.  The classic tech tree has been discarded in favor of a tech web which is meant to provide the player with more freedom in how to progress in the game.  What it actually does is scatter related technologies all over the place making it very difficult to locate what you're looking for.  The sense of freedom also feels rather false after playing for a while as you are forced into researching specific technologies to keep up with your opponents, deal with aliens, and persue your chosen victory condition.Barbarians in regular Civilization games have of course been replaced with aliens.  You might expect an interesting alien threat with a lot of depth like the mindworms from Alpha Centauri, but instead we simply have a constant annoyance that requires significant military technology to deal with (one of the things removing freedom from the tech web.)  All alien types appear at the very beginning of the game including the very strong siege worms and they will just move around killing terraforming units and settlers.  They rarely attack military units but are very strong in the early game and will always win if they do until you have invested in military technology.  If you kill a lot of them or attack a nest without destroying it, they will become much more aggressive but that is the most depth you can expect from them.The AI has been significantly downgraded as well.  In order to promote a wide range of playstyles, Firaxis removed all personality from the leaders, basically turning them into cardboard cutouts.  For some reason they still created a number of factions and are planning 4 more for the first expansion even though the choice of leader has no impact on gameplay.  Diplomacy has taken a similar hit, somehow managing to have even fewer diplomatic options than Civilization V.  The leaders are so passive you can play through an entire game without a single one declaring war on you, even after rubbing elbows with aggressive territory expansion.  No more late game warmongers like previous Civilization games, and no more interesting leaders.  It does however seem to fit with the lack of style in the rest of the game.  There is no  sci-fi UI and sound effects like Alpha Centauri and no interesting technology flavor text (the game uses uninteresting quotes from the new cardboard cutout leaders.)A ""quest"" system was added which initially sounded like a promising new way to mix up gameplay by giving players different goals.  Unfortunately 95% of the quests are the same thing: You built a building for the first time, pick one of two miniscule bonuses to permanently apply to all copies of that building for this game.  Half the time I didn't feel like there was even any choice since even after taking every single health bonus possible, including all offered in quests, I could barely keep the value positive even with a small empire.  The system has a lot of potential, and maybe it will be realized in expansions, but at this point it is pretty useless.I'm undecided on the new affinity system.  In essence each of the 3 paths embodies a specific philosophy which can affect diplomatic relations with other players and provides different units.  You earn affinity points mostly by researching specific aligned technologies in order to unlock more units and persue the affinity-specific victory condition.  While it does result in unit differences between players, the unit variety provided to each player is quite small and I'm not convinced that it actually results in any meaningful differences from a gameplay perspective.In summary, this game is one huge disaster.  I don't think even 3 expansions can save it, especially if they contain the miniscule amount of content announced for the first expansion.  I know some people are going to vote my review down because I only have 5 hours played, insisting that I haven't explored the new game mechanics well enough, but when a game leaves THIS BAD of an impression and is lacking ALL the features we wanted from a new sci-fi Civilization game, no amount of additional time is going to improve my understanding of the game enough for me to want to play it again or to recommend it.  I never thought that Firaxis could lose my trust but here we are.  Go play Alpha Centauri, it's 10x the game Beyond Earth is.			",862,202,24,72,69,9,114

												If BEyond Earth were a mod for Civ5, I would be singing its praises for the ingenuity of the changes made to its underlying engine, the amount of work that went into revamping the graphics, and the willingness to venture beyond Civ's historical framework out into the unknowns of science fiction.But I have to consider that Beyond Earth is in fact not a fan-made modification of Civ5, but a release by Firaxis themselves, and billed as a complete standalone game valued at a release price no less than that of its ""parent"". In this light, the game feels lackluster and incomplete. It has none of the boldness that characterized the changes made in the step from Civ4 to Civ5, and most changes are superficial in nature. Worse yet, despite being so evidently a spin-off of a larger, more developed game (because let's not forget that Civ5 has two expansions under its belt by now, which hugely improved its scope and depth), Beyond Earth adds too little of its own to the Civ formula besides aforementioned superficial changes. Affinities are merely a replacement for Civ5's late-game Ideologies; the tech-web is structurally different and at first glance the most intriguing change, but navigating it devolves into a race for affinity points. The unit customization feels tacked on, barely even replacing Civ5's more complex promotion system.For something that can count Alpha Centauri among its forebears, which remains the benchmark for the 4X genre in science fiction, Beyond Earth simply falls short of achieving orbit.

The Short EndDon't waste your time or money on the game in it's current state, particularly if you're someone who enjoys the civ multiplayer experience. Either wait for the inevitable expansion packs or don't bother with it at all.The Long HaulI'm going to preface this with a disclaimer - I play civ for it's multiplayer, and the perspective I'm writing this review from is a multiplayer one. As such I'm leaving out a lot of core single player complaints (such as it's poor ai) in order to touch more on the multiplayer aspects of the game.The GoodThe sci-fi atmosphere is rich and enjoyableThe evolution of your unit and city aesthetics as you gain affinity points is interesting and adds some much-needed visual flair to the gameThe concept of being able to choose from a variety of bonuses for your civ as opposed to each one having a specific set of them is nice and (sort of) opens up multiple approaches to your starting strategyThe BadThe game looks, feels, and functions more like a total conversion mod or an expansion pack than a full release gameThe factions lack a sense of identity, and would all sort of blend together were it not for the fact that some are very, very poorly balanced in relation to the othersAlso, there are only 8 of them.The nonviolent victory conditions lack variety (two of them are almost exactly identical, one just being easier than the other) and are far too simple to accomplish to really present much of a challengeTrade routes are extremely powerful, so powerful in fact that they more or less completely mitigate unhealthiness debuffsThe health system is far too lenient, and strongly incentivizes infinite city sprawl strategies. It simply does not penalize you enough to make you care about being unhealthyTIle improvements take an incredibly long time to build, making things like the terrascape and biowell, improvements that would ordinarily be amazing, ultimately a waste of time in most scenarios since they can take almost a tenth of a game to completeEven something as simple as cutting down a forest takes 8 turns on quick speed, which is completely absurdAlmost every wonder in the game is pointless to build - they simply don't produce meaningful enough effects to be worth it, particularly in the case of some of the late game wondersWhile the aliens at first seem to be a threat, they ultimately don't amount to much more than a slight annoyance and take enormous amounts of punishment before they ever get upset with you enough to outright attack your settlementsThere is virtually no unit variety whatsoever, outside of affinity upgradesRuins are enormously strong and being lucky enough to find the right ones can net you free virtues, free affinity levels, and even skip over part of a victory conditionThe UglyThe UI is god awful and, in many cases (such as the city screen), is totally unusable if you aren't zoomed in nearly all the way due to just how enormous and clunky the buttons and graphics areWithout turning on yields it is extremely difficult to tell certain biomes apart from each other (particularly on the fungal map type)Just in general the overall visual and colour schemes the game went with are very dark and muddy, it's hard to distinguish many different resources and tiles from each other and, if you're visually impaired or have any form of colourblindness, you really have no option but to keep tile yields on at all timesMultiplayer is riddled with bugs and dysynch issues, most notable of which being that half the time when you resynch or have to reload a turn, some players will lose techs or buildings and be totally unable to reacquire them (the most common example being a player losing the computing tech and then being unable to build a spy agency for the rest of the game, even losing the one they built if they already had one)Players are completely unable to spy on capitals that have landed before them, and in some cases even if captured the player is still unable to place a spy in their newly-acquired citySettling on any resource tile will remove the resource that spawned there. As a general concept this is less than great but in practice what this means is that if you decide to land your capital on any tile other than the center one being suggested to you, there is a very high chance that you will settle on top of a vital titanium or oil node, costing you greatly in the early gameAffinity units are absurd. If you rush down your affinity techs and get your first units out before your opponent does you will win, absolutely no question. You can just slam them into cities at very little cost and virtually anything short of a city shot won't even scratch the paintCovert ops are broken, particularly in the case of the ARC faction since they recieve a bonus to spying that renders it impossible to stop them from building intrigue in your cities early on even if you have a counterspy present. Intrigue can be built up extremely fast, far faster than you'll probably be capable of defending against if you didn't rush down your spy agency. Operations at the highest level of intrigue have a much higher chance of success than they should, meaning that even if you have a mid level spy trying to initiate a coup d'etat in an enemy capital that has a counterspy present, you will still probably steal the cityThe questing system as it stands is extremely random and leaves games more up to chance than skill. Being lucky enough to get your extra trade route from your autoplant quest the next turn instead of 30 turns later, or getting 2 easy affinity quests in a row while other players get the much longer ones (or in some cases, broken ones that are uncompletable since the city it spawns for doesn't have the resource it requires) can and very often does decide gamesThe resources, bonuses, virtues, and quest descisions are all very poorly balanced and don't seem to have been thought through very well. Many are just objectively better than their counterparts, resulting in standard builds that no one deviates from and making diverse strategy in multiplayer games difficult to impossibleThe purity affinity is heavily imbalanced early game, offering the best bonuses early while also having their first affinity unit only require titanium instead of their affinity resource, making battlesuit rushes a very real possibility and severely limiting interesting strategies and styles of playStations are a joke. Not only are they not useful to trade with since internal route benefits are so much better, but they also appear in the worst places possible. More often than not I've found my capital flanked in every expandable direction by stations, forcing me to invest in early military while my opponents are free to expand as they pleaseThe Last WordThere's plenty more I could talk about here, but I only have so much space to write this. Ultimately, the game is a barebones, poorly thought out mess. The overall design philosophy behind the game seems to have been ""hey wouldn't this idea be cool in a game?"" instead of ""how can we make this idea work in a game?"", overall resulting in a sloppily balanced, short-lived, and unsatisfying spiritual successor to a much better game that any long time fan of Firaxis' work will be wholly dissappointed by.Beyond Earth is truly a product of it's time: a game that was released in an unfinished state in order to justify the purchase of patchwork dlc that will eventually make it a whole product. I personally detest this trend in modern gaming and I hope that sometime soon we'll see a game released once again that doesn't ask us to buy it twice in order to have a complete experience.

												Addenum: Rising Tide:Again, I tried to like the expansion but many of the original problems remain. Improvements: - diplomacy: is more complex but that doesn't necessarily mean better. Most of the time I don't bother contacting the other leaders but just blindly accept their proposals. At least there's a little more to it now. Still not my cup of tea. There seems to be too many optoins without any of them being overy substantial. - graphics: the sea is really nice. Problems: - wonders: are still horrible. None of them really are wonderful. Their effects are for the most part, minor. - map: too busy. There's so much on the map it's very often hard to see your units. - resources: there are too many resources. It's hard to keep track of what does what and why I need one over the other. None of them really seem special. I prefer Civ V's limited number, although they started to throw in more near the end just for the sake of having more which I didn't agree with. BERT could have done much better to have fewer resources but make the effects more substantial (needed for more buildings/units). - buildings: way, way too many buildings. This woudn't be a bad thing but they have many of the same effects (one will offer 2 health, another will offer 1, another will offer 1 health and 1 science). I'd prefer fewer buildings but with more substantial effects. Conclusion/short review: I applaud the efforts of the Devs/Firaxis and mainly bought the expansion out of loyalty and a wish to support Firaxis. I was hopeful but it's not the game for me. After 7 hours of play I've deleted the game. I'm now waiting for Civ VI. Certainly, a few of the things from BERT could be incorporated into VI like diplomatic capital which I thought was interesting. I really tried to like this game but I have to give it a thumbs down. Short review: - the game lacks personality.- the leaders are bland.- diplomacy is worse than Civ V- colour palatte/graphics make it hard ot distinguish tiles- buildings are boring and non-descript- wonders are underpowered and unimaginative- there are better games out there (Endless space, endless legend, Gal CIV III (when it comes out).Don't buy it. Long review:Problems: (1) Leaders: It's certainly been said before, the leaders are boring. They have no personality. They're animations are basically the same as well. (2) Diplomacy: Civ V's diplomacy was a huge stepdown from Civ IV but what made it passable was the excellent leader animations which made the model tolerable. With BE, you have the exact same diplomacy from V but with bland leaders. They had a real opportunity to make this game stand out but they decided to add in feature after feature rather than refining what was there. One common complaint regarding Civ V was the diplomacy but it seems the Devs here could really care less. Too bad. Great diplomacy could have rescued this game(3) Graphics: Certainly the graphics are different than what you see in V but they are ultimately forgetable and very frustrating. The biggest complaint I have is it's impossible to tell what some tiles are without hovering the mouse over them. On some planets you'll have purple tundra which looks very simlar to purple grassland which looks similar to plains. ARRGH. (4) Too many buildings: I think what ended up happening is when they were making the game the Devs realized you run out of things to do quickly since the game isn't very deep. Hence, they added more buildings to give you something to do with your cities rather than just allocating them to wealth, research, production. The end result is you get building 1 which give 1 health, and building 2 which gives 2 health and 1 science, and building 3 which gives 2 health and 2 science. None of them are interesting or something you'd b-line a tech to get because it will help you. They are all forgetable. (5) Wonders are horrible: Wonders in every Civ game were something that ultimately could give you a good boost. In BE they are basically slightly more powerful verisons of the normal buildings you'd already build but they cost 5-10 times as much. I don't even remember the names of any of them. Again, they're forgetable. (6) Victory conditions are too similar: Three of the 5 conditions are pretty much the same: Build special building, then in 30 turns you win the game if you remember to click the buildling every turn (yes, this is a simplification but that's pretty much it). Again, forgetable. Really the entire game is: forgetable. There are other games I'd try before spending any money on BE. Endless space, despite it's shortcomings really had more charm and gameplay. Endless legend is way better. If you doubt my review, check out the latest game play stats. Despite getting a huge patch a day ago the number of players hasn't jumped beyond 6200. Civ V, 4 years since release, is still at 35000. Firaxis dropped a rare bomb here. I truely hope that the Devs who worked on this don't play any significant role in Civ VI.			",57,19,3,16,40,0,19

												The game has potential, but suffers from severe soul deficiency. It plays like a full price total conversion mod for Civ V, with a space theme. It was nothing like the Alpha Centauri successor that I hoped to play.It would help if the world felt more alien —since everything felt way too familiar— and the writing better conveyed this feeling of mystery and thrill.Bottom line: recycled gameplay, not much innovation, landscape not really alien, and the writing is really bland.

												I have been a die-hard fan of the Civ franchise since I played the original Civilizations on my 8086 back in 91. I have purchased every Civ game/expansion since including Call To Power, Alpha Centauri and Revolution. It is with great dissapointment that I recommend NOT playing Beyond Earth.I have read several of the reviews on Steam and agree with most of the issues others have with the game so I won't reiterate. My biggest beef with Beyond Earth is its lack of replayability. I expect a Civ game to capture me and make me want to always ""play just one more turn."" With Beyond Earth, the first play through was OK, but every time I start a new game I lose interest by turn 100. No matter what faction or abilities I choose or affinity and victory conditions I pursue, every game feels exactly the same.I come back to the game every few weeks to try to learn to enjoy the game (I would like to get my $60 worth of play time out of it) but am unable to stay hooked. I certainly hope the next Civ title will make up for this disaster.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm so sad to write this review.  I'm a hard-core Civilization fan.  I've played Civ since the franchise was first launched.  I've literally logged hundreds of hours playing Civ 5 and all its DLC in Steam.  I also feel as though Alpha Centauri is still one of the best computer games ever made.  I've been looking forward to Civilization Beyond Earth for months.This game is such a terrible disappointment.  And I'm going to be as constructive as I can be in my criticsm.I hardly know where to begin.First of all, Wonders of the World are completely nerfed and uninspiring. There are no video sequences upon completing one.   There's no sense that youv'e actually accomplished something by building a Wonder.  Even more galling, from what I've seen (and I've already played the game over 12 hours just this weekend), Wonders don't even matter much.  Most Wonders seem to give palty bonuses that are on par with a single city building.  Literally.  I mean, c'mon!  If building the sci fi equivalent of the Pyramids is no different than building the sci fi equivalent of a Granary, what's the point?The Civolpedia is awful.  The help screens are appallingly unhelpful.  They don't link to one another.  It's not easy to understand what's going on in this game, and the ""help system"" makes it worse.  The prose of the ""backstory"" is dense and confusing, without any dramatic hooks to tie in a narrative, and make it interesting.  Even as a veteran Civ player, I was floundering trying to figure this game out, and the help system was about as useful as calling Comcast on a Saturday afternoon.  After about half an hour *just trying to figure out the Civolepedia* I started to drink.The Affinity system makes no sense.  Why ""force"" me to adopt certain affinities just because I research technology in a certain order?  Why not give me the choice to engineer my society through meaningful decisions, in terms of Affinities?  Even more perplexing, how can I be a ""humans first"" ""Gaia loving"" ""I am the Borg"" society, ALL AT ONCE?  Affinities should be mutually exclusive.This game is boring.  I played for over 200 turns and no one attacked me, other than some random aliens.  No one offered me any interesting challenges.   I'll admit, I tend to be a peaceful builder type, but to play in a world where no one goes to war, and where I don't feel the need to attack other factions or pump up my military to prevent being conquered... what's the point of that?The health system (a.k.a. ""happniess"") is broken.  Until you unlock certain late game techs, or build many, many special terrain upgrades, it's basically impossible to have more than 3 or 4 cities.  Yes, you read that right.  Forget infinite city sprawl, this game punishes you for trying to found or conquer more than about 3 cities for the first 150+ turns.  Absoultely abominable.  Dumb.Firaxis, I'm one of your biggest fans, but I feel like I should get my money back on this one.  If a developer were willing to e-mail me, I could offer about 20 helpful suggestions on how to fix this game, but until then, no one else should bother buying it. ",1,4,0,3,6,0,9

												It's the Civ we all know and enjoy but bland and lacking innovation or vision.On the positive side of the equation the game is stable, the Aliens spice it up a bit, the tech web allows a lot of options in research order, quests are included as part of the victory paths and the affinity system is cool.But there is so much that could be better.  Trade routes require excessive micromanagement, the quests are one dimensional, there is no surprise or story around the Aliens (e.g. more powerful units), the Aliens do not become aggressive quickly enough, the factions and leaders are bland and alike strategically, the victory screens are appallingly lame, the differences in the various worlds are very minor (opportunity lost to add massive replay value by having unique features on each map), the Diplomatic AI is inept, there is no story beyond the intro movie, and there are no Colony Governors (so it can become quite micro intensive on large maps).I'll play it plenty regardless because I enjoy 4X so much. But for those that have limited gaming budgets, the game represents appalling value for money.This game really is just a reskin of Civ V and feature wise we've gone backwards from a Brave New World. We'll need at least one expansion just to get to Brave New World level. There really is no excuse for this given it's the same engine.Secondly on Steam the game cost is US$90 in my region (Australia) with the price set by the publisher. Yes you can go elsewhere (e.g. OzGameShop) and pay about US$50, which is what any avid gamer would do, but more than a few casual gamers will spend US$90.You put those factors together and it's clear that management at Firaxis are focusing on milking the cow.  I would rather they had a vision for the future of 4X games and led the pack. Ironically, a focus on leading the pack is likely the better long-term business strategy anyway. As Devildog said in the eXplorminate review:""despite many cries of frustration from fans and well documented examples, leads me to believe that they’re both incapable and unaware of how much we hate these things.""http://www.explorminate.com/civilization-beyond-earth-review/Unless you are a huge fan of 4X games and Civ, I do not recommend this game.  Either wait for Expansions to improve the game and buy it during a sale or purchase Endless Legend instead which is a vastly superior game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was an ambitious attempt to revitalize the general form of Civilization V. On a theoretical level the game had the right ideas; more compelling 'story' elements to individualize your civilization, relevent and distinct cultural tracts that can intermingle, non-colonist NPC units that are more relevent and engaging than barbarians, and perhaps most importantly, the asymmetrical nature of the single player (the player starts before other NPC colonists do)- all that on top of art direction that implied futuristic societies steadily expanding.It falls significantly short of the goals it sets for itself, however. The story elements feel too much like branches from a tech tree that have special requirements, rather than actual social differences and decisions. Similarly, the cultural differences are more related to scientific achievement and infrastructure development than any sort of social phenomenon like language, religion, traditions, or government. Other than alienating other NPC colonists with different technology, there seem to be few effects of differing ideologies or cultures. The 'asymmetry' of the game still leaves the late game very stale- either you are hopelessly overpowered or boringly unchallenged. The actual gameplay mechanism functions as a very poorly balanced version of Civilization V. The resources required to build special units and buildings are accessible depending on your technological focus, but due to the zero sum nature of the tech 'web' rather than a 'tree', that means you're either relegated to being stuck with just one special resource option or accept being technologically inferior to the other NPC colonists. Rising Tide resolved some significant balance issues, as well as finally creating a balanced and satisying trade system that is relevent without becoming the focus of the game. Unfortunately, it also introduced the necessity of such tedious and continual micromanagement that the sense of satisfaction by building a new facility or researching new technology is entirely sapped. If this is on sale, grab it and check it out for a few games. If you're looking for something particularly deep or with perpetual replay value, this might not be the game for you.

Posted: October 27, 2014
												Let me start by saying that I'm a long time Civilization player and fan. I also consider myself a fairly experienced turn-based strategy player with hundreds of hours on record. Coming from almost 400 h. of playtime with Civilization V, I was really excited and looking forward to this new entry to the legendary franchise. I even pre-ordered the title with the hope to spend several hundred hours immersed into the game. I'm also a huge fan of sci-fi setting for videogames as it usually offer more room for innovation and interesting game mechanics.So, what's my take on Civ BE? I think it's a solid stand-alone turn based 4x strategy game. And I want to emphasize the word ""solid"" here. It's not great, it's not innovative, it's not complex... It's just solid. To put this in a different way - if you are new to this type of games, you should probably give it a try. On the other hand, If you're long-time Civilization player, you should pass on this one, at least in its current state.What are my main points of concern with this title? What can be improved and why I believe this game is unfortunately inferior in many ways to its predecessor (Civ V + all expansions)? 1. Lack of content, polish and personality  (i.e. units, cut-scenes, factions and their back story, )The game feels empty and tiny when compared to Civ V. I've put around 30 hours into it and I can confidently say that I'm bored and won't be coming back anytime soon. There's not much stuff to keep me entertained for a long period of time. It lacks replay value because you will always end up in identical scenarios no matter how differently you want to approach the gameplay.It's been mentioned multiple times, but the lack of personality behind the so-called factions / sponsors is surprising. The only significant difference between them is their ""special ability"" bonus, and that's it. There's no back story, lack of variety in buildings / units, nothing that you can feel identified with or attached to. They feel empty and meaningless and become annoying after just a few hours of gameplay. Are you expecting to see a cut-scene video after completing a huge landmark project (50+ turns) to get one step closer to victory? Nope. But there's surely a small animated piece when you finish building wonders, right? No, you're out of luck here as well... Well,  there must be a small video when you finally defeat your foes by making first contact with an ancient alien civilization that no one has ever seen before!? Sorry, but no. Everything in this department feels extremely unfinished and rushed out of the door. The game lacks immersion elements and starts feeling generic very quickly. There are two possibilities: either Firaxis consciously made the decision of removing / ""simplifying"" these components for the sake of saving development time / money. Or alternatively, they will sell it at some point in form of DLC. Or likely both... Which would be kinda sad.2. Let's just say that the UI isn't great.I'm not sure who took the decision to make the UI as minimalist as possible, but in my opinion it didn't turn out well. Let me list a few reasons here:- Tech tree / City view feel unfinished and outright inferior to Civ V. All icons look the same to me. There's no color icons which make it hard to distinguish between different technologies / buildings. After 30+ hours of gameplay, if you showed me any icon from the game (either from tech tree or city view) I wouldn't be able to recognize any of them.- Omission of basic info, like: which building you just finished building in your city (HELLO Firaxis!?), lack of strategic view, lack of full list of cities / units / trade routes under your control,- Victory progress for different players is extremely difficult to understand and follow because this information is not presented in a visual way.- There's no possibility to know how to get, say an ""Emancipation"" victory beforehand. You don't know what technologies you need to research, what buildings you need to build or what you have to do with these buildings once you finish building them.3. RIP World Wonders.I love building World Wonders in Civ V. It just feels so satisfying and rewarding every single time. Many players base their entire strategy around building Wonders. The whole experience is so ""Civ - like"" and different in every game. ""Beyond Earth"" removes this experience all together. We still technically have them, they just feel meaningless, weak, empty and lacking any significant impact on gameplay. You can't tell a World Wonder apart from a normal building. There's a short pop-up with something I wouldn't dare to call ""animated piece"" that you will instantly forget. Not sure why Firaxis decided to go this route, I guess they couldn't figure out a good way to integrate World Wonders within a deeply futuristic setting. It's extremely disappointing though.4. The AI has identical issues to Civ V, maybe worse.Everything about AI feels like Civ V all over again, just in a bad way. It's as dumb as ever, all the meaningless diplomatic choices, weird decision making, cheating on higher difficulties - it's all there. Even dialog lines are the same, just feels a bit less meaningful due to lack of personality in each of the faction's leaders. Combine this with the fact that every game you play against the same exact factions (due to lack of variety), it becomes old / boring very quickly.5. Quests are boring.The quest system is kind of broken. It doesn't matter which faction you play, or which affinity you choose, be sure you will get the same exact ""grindy"" quests, no matter what. After a few hours, you will start skipping through them without reading or caring about them. On paper, quest system should add a layer of variety and deepen your engagement with the game, but it just fails completely to do so.It's not all bad news though. This game has potential and I'm sure with some patching love and a few expansions it will become better, maybe even great. It's just that I personally feel disappointed and was expecting way more out of this new entry to the Civ franchise.Some things I like about the game:1. The new orbital layer is promising. It has interesting potential and adds a different dimension of strategy and potential development to the game. But as with several other features, it feels a bit unfinished / unpolished.2. Overall I like the affinity system as it offers three distinct paths to your development. But again, as with orbital layer I don't think it's fully explored yet. 3. The Aliens have meaningful impact on the early gameplay and definitely play out better than their barbarian counterparts in Civ V. That said, they become irrelevant pretty quickly as their Level doesn't scale according to your development. Unlike barbarians (Barbarian marine anyone?), Aliens become obsolete after you get your first affinity upgrades. Summing up, Civ BE is a solid stand alone 4x strategy game IF we don't compare it to its predecessors. If you are new to this genre and like sci-fi setting, I could recommend it.I wouldn't recommend this game to any Civilization fan / player nor someone experienced with this type of games. Just continue playing Civ V and wait until patches / expansions come out. Firaxis has some history of making great expansions and improving their games. I hope they will do the same with Civilization Beyond Earth.Final review score: 6/10			",61,13,0,5,11,1,11

 Doesn't come together I cannot recommend this game. I've put in only 33hrs and already find myself not starting it up anymore, as opposed to the 600+ hrs on Civ V. (+DLC)I was so excited about the new systems and the rpg/story elements, the new opportunities the space exploration setting would allow for that i bought CivBE as a pre-order, a first and certainly a last for me.  The problem, as stated in other reviews, is that there's no soul to this game. I'm contantly asking myself 'why should i care?' and the mid-to-end game even has me clicking next turn without making any moves, something that would never happen in the previous Civ games. I wonder if 2K/Firaxis realise the shortcomings of this game have nothing to do with polish (it looks good!), ui (still quite allright), the concept (it's Civ!) or the mechanics but rather with it just being uninteresting.  I do not feel as if i'm a representative of (a faction of) planet earth fighting for a new place among the stars to continue human civilization.  The ingredients are there but it just doesn't come together. And no tweak-patch is going to fix that i'm afraid. Guess we'll have to wait for the expansion packs before it is a game worth your time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												With Rising Tide's release it's back to being hard to recommend Beyond Earth again. The winter update improved the base game a fair bit and made it more enjoyable to play but then Rising Tide came out and kind of threw a lot of that progress away, and introduced a mix of good and bad ideas that will require further balancing. Rising Tide has significantly changed certain aspects of the game for the better--water settling/tile development is huge--but the balance is completely out of whack again. The pacing of the early game is completely random now. With the amount of resource pods and expedition sites whoever finds the most can boost a crazy amount in the first 50-100 turns. Single or multiplayer, you're going to want to spam explorers and rush anything (3 Prosperity virtues, 2 levels of Supremacy, and a building quest) that can net you more expedition pods early-game because of the insane boosts to culture, production, science and energy they provide. On top of that there's the possibility of discovering Relics in each expedition which in turn can be spent to further boost culture, science, food, and production or saved to be used for unlocking Relic Buildings and Wonders, some of which are incredibly broken. Internal trade routes are back to being broken, especially with Al Falah and a specific Relic Building, and certain Relic Wonders are completely broken. Hybrid Affinities are kind of a dead end, you still have to chase a specific Affinity to get its victory wonder. Even though the Affinity victory condition has been pushed to Affinity level 15 (up from 13), games are roughly still 200-300 turns long. Beyond Earth games are 200 turns shorter than Civ V on average. There's an early-game, a mid-game, and then the game is done because someone trots out a victory wonder. There's no late-game in Beyond Earth where late-game techs, wonders and units get a chance to shine. So Rising Tide has changed how you play the early-game you're ultimately still playing the same limited ""end"" game. Build some wonders and turtle or go for domination.The way Affinity experience is acquired now is a mess. Previously neutral tech branches that everyone will research over the course of a match now provide multiple Affinity experience. You will easily end a game with multiple levels in multiple Affinities without even trying. It's even possible to get every Affinity leveled up to 18 before the 300th turn and basically have access to every unique Affinity/Hybrid unit in the game outside of what you've locked your generic units into being. It's also worth noting that not every unit in the game gets a Hybrid Affinity variation and there's no Hybrid Affinity City art. Cities and armies in Rising Tide can be a hodge podge of every Affinity and Hybrid. In Beyond Earth vanilla you had to focus on an Affinity and chase those techs in order to be able to hit your victory condition in time, now everyone just sort of has access to everything. Going Harmony or Supremacy and expanding aggressively early? Don't worry, now you'll likely be able to build a Gene Garden (lvl 2 Purity health generating building), without even trying you'll likely have the necessary Affinity levels. Health has gone from being a constraint to a basically a non-issue with everyone having access to everything in conjunction with the new orbital unit that you can access fairly early on top of all of the health wonders in the game now.There's simply so much in Rising Tide that needs to be addressed with later balancing patches. Certain Factions Unique Advantages are insanely powerful if not outright broken, while others border on being useless. The warscore and peace negotiations are kind of busted as of now. The old diplomatic system was completely gutted from the game but in some respects it was better than the new diplomatic system that was added in Rising Tide. There are more kinds of aliens but they are less of a threat. The list goes on and on. While it's nice that Firaxis have committed to doing balance patches, it would have been better if they did a public beta first. Discover all of these balancing issues that their own internal testing somehow missed and address them before releasing the expansion. Instead it's another mess, further frittering away what goodwill people may have left. I would recommend Civ V Complete or Endless Legend over the current iteration of Beyond Earth and Rising Tide. Later patches may change this, again, but for now Beyond Earth is a mess.			",425,72,4,47,13,4,43

												Like many fans, I was really hyped for this game, having played the crap out of Civ 5. Unfortunately, it feels like an inferior Civ 5. Cities, units, combat, and geography are mostly the same. That's fine, but what's not similar to Civ 5 is typically worse.IMO, the tech web is a mess. I understand that it's now non-linear, and you can't research everything, but it's so clunky and disorganized that I often feel like I'm just researching random things that I don't even need. I see something I want but it's 5 techs away, with 100+ turns of research required, so instead I research some smaller thing that doesn't help me at all.Aliens replaced barbarians, but again it feels clunky. Befriending them seems great, but more than anything they simply get in your way. They keep spawning infinitely, and so if you don't kill them off they overrun your space, especially on a small space like an island. If you do kill them, then AI players hate you, just for defending your space. Civ is a game about expanding and placing cities, is it not? Barbarians worked in 5 because they were annoying but rewarding too, whereas aliens are annoying, take up space, and get you denounced by AI players.The interface is crap as well IMO. It's designed in a ""futuristic"" style, but it just comes off as busy and user-unfriendly. Hell, for the first two games I couldn't even find the Trade Overview screen because they did such a good job of hiding things instead of having everything displayed at once (but still cleanly) like in Civ 5. Some things are too big or too small, and like I said, things aren't clear, they're hidden for some reason.Altogether, it just feels like a less interesting Civ 5 in space. For me, I can sink hours at a time into a Civ 5 game because the tech race is so fun, competing for wonders and grabbing that good area before your neighbour does. In BE, there's no tech race, because everyone does their own thing, except on top of that, tech in BE seems quite disorganized. Instead of racing players for space, you're racing annoying aliens that don't stop spawning, and also get you known as the BE equivalent of a ""warmonger"". Not enjoyable.TLDR, if you haven't played Civ 5 (with the DLCs), then do that instead. If you have, well maybe you should just play it more. That's what I've been doing.			",46,2,0,7,0,0,7

												(Too long to read? This review is also available in video format below for your convenience.)It's been fifteen long years since Sid Meier has given us the opportunity to conquer the cosmos with Alpha Centauri. Set 600 years into the future where the earth is on the brink of destruction. The nations of the world send some of their best and brightest into space as a last ditch effort to colonize another planet. With an uncharacteristically utopian view on things, many nations have combined and cooperate with one another. For instance, Australia and Polynesia merge to become Polystralia, America, Canada, and Mexico become the American Reclamation Corporation and the entire continent of Africa becomes the African Union to name a few examples. These alliances take to the stars to begin anew on the wild frontier of alien planets. Utilizing the core of Civ V, Beyond Earth is a turn-based strategy featuring hexagonal tiles on a grid without unit stacking. The terrain offers benefits in the same way its predecessor does. Mountains are impassible, hills provide extra defense, and rivers are difficult to cross. You start the game by picking a plot of land to build your first city, while each of the tiles offer different bonuses, such as food, production and energy.After founding your first city, you’re able to explore the alien landscape, searching for resource pods and artifacts for your explorers to excavate. It's here that one of the games’ first alterations comes to light: quests. Players will be given quests to complete and choices to make that help dictate the evolution of your civilization as well as providing additional buffs and bonuses. Diplomacy is alive and well among these new colonies allowing you to trade with other civilizations, and you have access to all the diplomacy options seen in Civilization V, as well as the inclusion of favors which can be cashed in on later trades.The Alien life-forms are the game’s equivalent to barbarians albeit a lot stronger. They are however not as aggressive and will generally leave your units alone unless they happen to path towards a tile you’re occupying. This changes throughout the game though based on the Affinities you choose. Also if you go out of your way to attack an Alien or approach a nest, they will become hostile for a few turns. Certain bonuses and abilities make it worthwhile to actively exterminate these pests but later in the game that can become a diplomatic blunder with civilizations that are more sympathetic to alien life.The Affinities are by far the most unique feature to Beyond Earth. They allow you to specialize your Civilization with a specific ideology. Players who follow the Harmony path will have players synthesizing with their new planet and the alien life that inhabits it. Supremacy takes a page from the cyberpunk playbook with a focus on augmentation and improvement through technology. Finally there is the path of Purity, which focuses on retaining humanity and destroying anything that threatens that. Not only do these Affinities grant you special units and buildings, but they also change the way that other civilizations react with you. Think of it as being on-par with Religion or Political Doctrines from other Civilization games.The technology tree is also non-linear in this, allowing for you to choose any number of paths which allows for a lot of variety between different civilizations. It did seem like there were a few very specialized paths that were far superior to the others though, as you generally want to amass whatever Affinity you’re going with quickly, as it will immediately upgrade your troops without the need to do things manually like the past Civ games. This is where the differences in Beyond Earth end though, as everything else is simply re-skinned from Civilization V. Happiness has been replaced with Health, Gold has been replaced with Energy, while food and production remain the same. There are also a lot of things that don’t really make sense, such as having the technology to colonize another planet without having anyway to unveil the map. You’ll uncover the mystery planet much the same way as your primitive warriors will back in 4000BC like past Civ games. The tech-tree also has some inconsistencies such as having to research Physics, Chemistry and Computers despite the game taking place in the year 2600.All of the units function the same way as well, with the majority of units being melee along with a few ranged, naval, and air units. The fact that naval technology is used at all is a bit strange with hovercrafts only being unlocked late-game. One would think the majority of units would be flying in a time like this while the few air units in the game function exactly the same way as jets from previous Civilization games.The world in general feels exactly like past civ games, with no option to move on to other planets and what’s worse is that the game seems to have lost any charm or personality that was apparent in other Civ games. Leaders like Genghis Khan, Gandhi, and Montezuma are all replaced with overly polite, boring politicians. None of the civilizations displays any semblance of personality or is anyway memorable. Having a few alien civilizations would have been a great way to add some personality to the proceedings. Espionage has also been completely buffed and is now nearly game breaking, as spies are now able to stage coup-d’états and take over other civilization’s capitals without any resistance. Should you take a capital, the AI civilizations barely seem to react and will still not declare war on you.If you were expecting this installment to not have bugs, you would be sadly mistaken as the multiplayer is still barely playable. You’ll constantly be faced with disconnects and crashes where you’ll have to re-host the game. You could of course continue the game and have your friends rejoin you, but that will be at the cost of the AI temporarily taking over their civilization and rerouting all production, scientific research and virtues. Even when playing single player, I faced the odd random crash to my desktop which had me frequently reloading auto-saves.The game also feels a lot more tedious when compared to past Civilization games as you'll have to babysit trade convoys and orbital units every few turns.Ultimately, Civilization: Beyond Earth feels like a mod or scenario for Civilization V. It doesn’t stray away or do anything innovative enough to warrant being a standalone title. While the non-linear tech tree, quests and affinity system are welcomed, they allow for some unbalanced combinations. Beyond Earth is also missing many features from past Civ games such as Corporations, Religion, and Great People. Having more meaningful interactions with aliens would have been welcomed as well but the game feels like it was inspired by Sid Meier watching the movie Starship Troopers. Beyond Earth isn’t a bad game; it just fails to meet the standard set by past Civilization titles and can feel a lot more tedious in the process. We suspect that like its predecessor, Beyond Earth will improve immensely with the addition of expansions but as of now, any cravings you have for space exploration might be better satiated by taking a trip to the theater to see Interstellar.This review is also available in video format:

												Verdict: Wait for a sale or (desperately needed) DLC bundleWhat Beyond Earth is:1) A sibling of CIV 5 - for better or worse -  - Same engine  - Same unit types - Same diplomacy  - Same trade system  - Same AI cheats on harder difficulty2) Some welcome improvements on CIV 5: + Improved espionage system + Orbital mechanics layer is an improvement on the SMAC version of the same + More interesting ""barbarian aliens"" - similar to the worm boils in alpha centauriWhat Beyond Earth isn't:1) A spritual successor to Alpha Centauri - No elevation/rainfall - No terrain modification - No advanced improvements - No environmental effects - No compelling story or narrative2) A finished game worth the release price - AI is weak - even on the hardest difficulty (Apollo), players used to CIV V will mop the floor on the first or second play through. - The usual launch bugs are there: No achievements for some on victory (despite getting them during the game), graphics issues for others, and of course balance issues. - No post game breakdowns (graphs, rankings, score, ANYTHING) - Wait for a sale to pick up the base game - Or wait for the inevitiable expansion DLCs to get the ""real game""I love Scifi, I love CIV games, I REALLY loved SMAC - but this is CIV 5 release all over again. Underwhelming core game that desperately needs to be finished with the DLC that is surely in the works even now. Remember how CIV 5 had G&K and Brave New World? Remember how that finished the game into what it should have been from day 1? This is exactly like that.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												COMPARING BEYOND EARTH TO CIV 5:Having played Civ II, III, IV, V and BE before and after the Rising Tide expansion, there are pros and cons to each. Civ 5 is currently the most popular game in the franchise, and as such, I'll be comparing Civ BE to it.Pros of Beyond Earth:*Building wide (many cities) is viable, and even preferable. ""Health"" replaces happiness as the population limiter that was in Civ 5, and it is much much easier to deal with. For starters, health is more of a spectrum. There are bonuses to having extra health while the penalties for negative health are less intense and more gradual. I've always enjoyed being very expansionistic in the Civ games and was disappointed that this is less accessible in Civ 5. If you enjoy playing wide, ruling a vast empire, and have a thing for manifest destiny, Beyond Earth will certainly fill that more than Civ 5.*Combat and tactics is the best it's ever been. Civ 5 made great progress in removing the ability to stack units, but my biggest complaint about it is the lack of unit diversity until around the WWII era. In Beyond Earth, you can get your infantry, cavalry, ranged, siege, air, naval, submarines, etc. all relatively early in the game. In Civ 5, you're stuck with only about 3 unit types for over half the game. There are also several special units for each ""affinity."" Each unit can be upgraded with different promotions selected as you level up your affinity. There are also sattellites that can be launched. These orbital units range from simple solar collectors that give you extra energy (gold) on the affected tiles to lasers that can bombard cities from space.*Affinities. These are essentially the ideologies Civ 5 added in it's Brave New World expansion. You have one of three affinities to choose from which will dictate how humanity will progress through the game. Purity focuses on perfecting the human form. Supremacy merges humanity with machines. Harmony merges humanity with alien life. Your affinity can affect win conditions, unit types, available buildings/wonders, and diplomatic relations. It also functions as a great narrative device.*Tech web. In Civ 5, you start in the ancient era and research technologies through a tree. In Civ BE, you start in the near future at the center of a tech web. The end-game techs are on the outside of the web, but you still choose which techs you want and when you want them. Though this can be a lot to take in, this does allow much flexibility in the way you build your empire.You may have more things you like, but these are the large selling points for me.Cons of Beyond Earth.*Few victory conditions. You have a choice of domination, contact (similar to science victory), or an affinity-based victory. Though I personally go for domination victories regardless of which Civ game I'm playing, it is nice to have more options. Civ 5 allows you domination, cultural, science, and diplomatic victories, all of which have a fairly deep way of obtaining them. Beyond Earth basically has a domination victory and two separate science victories. (Your affinity victory will be largely dictated by your science and production.)*Culture is shallow and there is no religion. Religion was added to Civ 5 via the Gods and Kings expansion. Though there was no religious victory, religion could influence your civilization greatly and influence diplomatic relations as well. Culture exists in the way of virtue trees, similar to the social policies of Civ 5. These virtues are well-worth gunning for which does add value to culture, but there is no way to ""win"" with culture. Focusing on culture would allow more virtues thus resulting in a stronger civ, but again, you can't win on culture alone anymore.*Civ leaders are relatively stale. The passive buffs to each civ are interesting, but the personalities of each leader are pretty dry. Honestly, I think the biggest reason for this is that they are not representations of historical figures. Rather, the leaders are entirely fictious. This makes it more difficult to develop and flesh out an impressive persona. I find the leaders and their dialogue to be just as animated and dramatic as previous games in the series. The difference, however, is that when meeting Genghis Khan in a Civ 5 game, I have historical knowledge to draw on and it helps bring the character to life. Meeting the leader of Space Africa, I only have what I experience in-game.I've also left out several aspects of Beyond Earth that others may enjoy. The Pros listed are simply the reasons that bring me back to BE. The game gets a bad rep, but there are things about Civ 5 that make me want to play it, and there are other things about Civ BE that make me want to play that instead.At the end of the day, Civ 5 is the deeper game. There are more victory types allowing in different ways to focus on building your empire. All yields are critical in Beyond Earth, but not all of them result in victory. There are more leaders to choose from in Civ 5 as well. Despite this, I keep finding myself coming back to Beyond Earth. Both games feel different to me, and I highly enjoy playing them both. I personally have always loved having a massive army and empire while fighting wars with other superpowers. That experience is a rarity in Civ 5 whereas it's a promise in Beyond Earth.I've left any mention of the Rising Tide DLC out of the review as I have not had ample time to play it. These are all my assertions on the base game. If you like civ, outer space, and are looking for a new experience then give Beyond Earth a shot. It's worth the price tag, but sales never hurt either. If you want someone to play with, go ahead and add me and I'd love to join in!			",48,12,0,9,6,1,11

												This is coming from someone who also has 1245 gameplay hours of Civilization VThis is Civ V Lite.  If you absolutely love Sci-Fi world building, then you will have fun with this.  This game fails at anything beyond that.Balance:-You are given the illusion of ""choices"" but there is generally one best path to take with very minor differences in what technology, virtues, affinities, and units you need.  Taking any other route is impractical even in a friendly game.-Tech Web is full of requirements, not options.-Lack of tailor-made units:  You get 2 promotion options for individual units no matter how high the unit gets in veterancy.  One is healing damage (which increases the amount healed based on veterancy) and the other is a 10% combat boost.  Any other additional abilities are applied to all units of that type based on affinity.Replayability:-Affinity-exclusive units are only minorly unique.  All other units that change based on affinity are more for aesthetics than strategic prowess.  The statistical differences are below minor and almost not even worth mentioning.-Stations (City-States):  One station will always want to spawn near you around the same point in the game.  You are always guaranteed a station to work with.-Civilizations' abilities have minor impacts.  You will notice the differences in civilization abilities for the very early part of the game,  but, as with other aspects of the game, these differences fall off not long after.-No Unique Units/Buildings:  It doesn't matter what nation you play as.  It is more simple to just identify the different civilizations as ""red team"" or ""blue team"" and so on.  Affinity-exculsive units try to pick up this slack, but fail at it due to the game's static nature.-Absence of luxury resources further takes away from a civilization's unique role on the game board.-Replayability is practically non-existant.Beyond Earth is it's own machine that follows it's own set of rules.  The player is just one cog in that machine.  If these rules were not made and enforced, the game's balance would fall into shambles because there are very few ways to succeed and stay on the same level of the other civilizations on the board.  It lacks the true freedom of choices that are provided in Civilization V.   Despite the existance of Beyond Earth's ""tech web,"" I feel as if I have more freedom of choice with Civ V's tech tree.Beyond Earth would have been better off being added onto Civilization V as ""Future Era"" technologies.  The aesthetic concept is appealing, but the execution is absolutely horrid and fails to apply concepts that have already been proven to work in Civilization V.			",96,5,0,25,8,2,16

												I cannot recomend this game until they fix the idiotic diplomacy system. As soon as AI settles one single settlement near your territory, even on the other side of the planet, they threaten you to stop expanding near them. If you dig up artifacts for find sattelites near them they tell you to stop, but they can dig up anything near you and there is no option to tell them to stop. If you ignore them they declare war, but your only option is to declare war without warning first. After 138 hours of gameplay I am giving up. This is not a good heir to Alpha Centauri and pales in comparison.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was so excited for this game but unfortunately it didnt live up to the hype. It feels more like a mod for Civ5 than a full game in its own right.

												Good mechanics, good diplomacy, excellent tech tree. But... Lack of buildings, cold feel, and long term games loosing the spark. Why? Because it simply gets repetitive, I feel like there's something missing. I think you shouldn't be able to upgrade troops, instead you should get new ones as the game evolves. If a civilization has one upgrade over you, you will get smashed in combat. Aliens are really painful at the start of the game it happens often that you get completely invaded and can't do anything. And there are no luxuries in the game. I also feel like some items from Civ 5 are drastically missing. Like boats, for example, there are only two main naval units. Also, wonders aren't that important anymore. It feels like building them is pretty much useless. But the main aspect that is missing is population interaction. There is no more religion and no more great persons, no world congress and so little Civilizations! Just so many features that have been cut off from Civ 5. As a cherry on the cake, the graphical aspect makes the game feel really cold and lonely. Some people love it, but others, like me find it to be diverting me to other occupations. This game will keep you entertained for some time, but you play a few games and then simply get bored of what it offers, which is my case. 50 hours in and I simply don't feel like clicking play now...

												After reading the latest reviews I finally understood that the reaction to this game probably depends on what you have been doing for the past 5-6 months. It’s very subjective. So, judging from my own experience:-	If you are a 30+ yo Civ and SMAC fan, who only has enough time to play games on weekends and haven’t played a 4X game for a couple months – you’ll probably be ecstatic like me.-	If you are a Civ fanatic, who has been playing Civ5 to death every day up until last Friday and was looking for a brand new 4X experience or a major breakthrough in gameplay – you’ll probably be disappointed.After playing CIV VI I still think that they could have kept it in the works for another year and give us a few more DLCs to this one instead.

												Anticipated this game a lot. Hoped for a space themed Civ5 and some more.What I got was a game that consists mainly of clicking 'next turn'. Even on medium-high difficulty the game is just incredibly shallow.There's a new 'virtue' system that allows you to go through 3 different paths, but you scan score points in these paths only through research and literally three random quests that you might, or might not run into.I'd recommend waiting a couple of months for the next updates and content packs and hope that firaxis steps up their game. Right now, Civ5 on launch day was more complex than this.The price is not even close to being justified.			",84,12,1,9,8,1,23

												I have been playing Cvilization for almost 25 years already. I was addicted to CIV I as a kid, played CIV II A LOT when I was in college, then Civilization Call to Power which was also pretty good. I did play CIV III a bit, but went quickly on to CIV IV which I played for years and years and years, with all official expansions, and installed and played A LOT of community mods, some of which were absolutely fantastic (thinking of Fall from Heaven II and Caveman2Cosmos and sooooo many others). I played CIV IV Colonization and throughly enjoyed it as well in its relative simplicity.The Civilization series altogether are the games I played the most in my life. Every new version that would come out was better than the previous, more complex, more accurate, more fun.Then came this trend of the past few years to simplify games, make them more mobile oriented, more mass consumable by people who play for 20 minutes then buy the next game.This trend is extremely noticeable in CIV V and also on CIVBE. Even the expansions of these games only bring back concepts that were included in previous versions of CIV, sometimes even on the basic ""vanilla"" ones. There is almost nothing new in these two games with few exceptions (like the tech tree in CIVBE, which is still only tiny when compared to CIV IV with Caveman2Cosmos mod)I bought CIV V Complete and played some hours, then didn't even bother and only tried CIVBE during a free weekend, and I say with my decades of experience with Civilization: go play CIV IV, install all mods, try them. Then you will never even want to look at the newer versions again.Call me old fashioned... but I do wish Civilization would go back to its roots of being among the most accurate and complex games around. Sid Meier lost it along the way. What a pity....................................			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I haven't reviewed anything before, but considering my love for the Civ series, I felt like I should leave some feedback. Yes, you're aware that the game is just a repackaged Civ 5. But the biggest change I've noticed is its loss of charm. A lot of the enjoyment from the past Civilization series came from its conglomeration of historically-prominent faces, all brought together to rescript human history. There was always something charming about each playthrough, whether it be Ethiopia seizing Seattle and Boston from the United States, the Iroquois researching flight before the 1500's, or Alexander's typical crash and burn just a few turns before reaching diplomatic victory. Beyond Earth is a different story, and it's one that I've had a hard time getting myself to care about. Although the premise of ""a thousand years into the future"" itself may be a much tougher sell than literal human history, what has ultimately pushed me away has been its lack of character building and dialogue. Yes, I understand how ridiculous that sounds, but outside of the economic/skill perks of each faction, there hasn't really been much of a discernable personality from leader-to-leader, and as a result, to quote every girl I've ever asked out: ""I'm just not that interested."" About halfway through each of my four playthroughs, I reached a point where, outside of winning just for competition's sake, I didn't really care too much about the outcome. There's no Gandhi to hate, no Queen Elizabeth to fend off until you research submarines. From time to time I did have some interesting interactions with the AI, one instance being when the nearly-cyborg Slavik leader stole my capital with a spy, but ultimately there isn't much happening between myself and the leaders I know little-to-nothing about to fuel those ""one... more... turn..."" feelings from the previous games. ""Kavitha of the Kavithan Protectorate has denounced me?"" u wot m8? That doesn't have much significance to me. It's like saying ""Leaderperson of the Red Team has denounced you."" There may be some backstory to each of these factions/sponsors/leaders, but after 40 hours of play, it hasn't really made itself evident, and the most I can say about each leader is along the lines of ""yeah, he's the African guy, he grows headphones throughout the game, and he hates it when I kill aliens.""  And continuing on that, it may be my lack of ""affinity"" for science fiction, but most of the time, I don't understand what I am researching, or what I am building in each city. I understand the effects, but outside of +7 science, I don't know what the hell a ""Cynosure"" is, and I don't care enough to find out. It's just not the same as building the Eiffel Tower, but that's not entirely the game's fault. What is the game's fault is that there just isn't much new to gameplay mechanics, and a lot of the issues of the previous games still linger, including: - Confusing/unintentionally nonsensical AI interaction: In the past games, you'd get some flak from other leaders for settling too rapidly or too close to their borders, but it seems to have amplified in this game, to a pretty unenjoyable degree. in 3 out of 4 playthroughs (the fourth being a 1v1 duel), I immediately received requests to stop settling in ""lands considered our own"" after settling only my second city. Didn't matter in what direction or where I settled, it happened every time. The bipolar one-turn shifts from ""friendly"" to ""denouncing"" still happen as well, still often for reasons unexplained, still leaving me wanting, at the very least, some sort of explanation. - ""Difficulty"": The ""difficulty"" problem seems to still be there, as playing on harder difficulties doesn't actually make the AI smarter, but just gives them boosts to offset their stupidity. I remember feeling a little disappointed after winning my first game on Deity, not just because of that ""Well, now what?"" feeling, but because I didn't feel like I had beat a better opponent, just an opponent with more stuff. You know those ghost trials on Mario Kart? You know how every one of these games is called Sid Meier's Blah Blah Blah? Maybe it's too difficult to make AI smarter, but it'd at least be cool if we could actually try to beat Sid Meier's score in his own game, or have an extra element of competitiveness.  - Annoyances as opposed to challenges: Still somewhat in the same vein as ""difficulty,"" a lot of the aspects of the game which are supposed to be ""challenges"" are just kind of more time-sucking annoyances. For example, about 150 turns into my most recent game, a 1v1 duel, I moved my entire military into my opponent's territory to take over for domination. As a sort of penalty, the game sprouts up a couple alien nests, forcing me to spend another few turns to change production so siege worms (and, no, they weren't spy sieges) don't destroy the resources I need. ""Quests"" have been introduced to the series, and while some of them have been beneficial, they fall into two categories: click one of two boxes and see what you get, or take 30 turns doing this-this-this-and-this just to find out that you get *this*. And although aliens pose a more dynamic challenge than the classic barbarian, after your empire has reached a certain size, doing things like defending trade routes is still just a time suck, one that isn't worth the loss of probably 1-3 trade vessels over the course of the game.  - Multiplayer/Online: I haven't played an online match yet. Because I haven't been able to find one, and when I have, I am either kicked before joining or receive an ""error when joining session"". The general point here is that Civ has never had proper multiplayer support, something that would have made a new installment of Civ much more intriguing. I see so much potential with Civ online - the random people who join games can often turn out to be much more enjoyable than your standard random gamers, and facing 5-11 people with the same basic start is a much better challenge than trying to beat a stupid computer compensated with handicaps. It might be too early to judge on this yet, but just the fact that I have to go into multiplayer and find a room created by a host, and not on a dedicated server, is enough to tell me that the problem hasn't been fixed yet. That's not to say that, on it's own, it isn't a solid game. Anything built on the mechanics of Civ 5 should be pretty enjoyable. But as the next step in the Civilization series, I am disappointed. And with the question coming down to ""do you recommend this game?"", I'd have to say no. I would (and will) recommend Civ 3-5 wholeheartedly as some of the best games ever, but as far as I'm concerned, this should be considered more of a $10 expansion to unlock after completing a science victory in Civ 5. In the meantime, I'll be waiting for a true Civ 6, and hopefully you and I will be able to play a full game online without the damn thing crashing.			",15,5,0,8,10,1,10

												A grand waste of my money, time, and thought.Thusfar, I have played 11 online hours and a total of 32 offline hours (recorded with a secondary software since I have no wifi at work) and I can say that I greatly regret this purchase. $49.99 for a game that is, at best, a reskinned Civ 5 with less playable Civs, a confusing tech tree, and very little explanation of what is needed and why the player should care. As of now, the only redeeming factor for this game is the mod community which adds several new Civs, better wonders, and reasons to CARE about what you do. With this being said, it is a very, VERY sad day in which I say that a game is only decent (at best) simply because of the modding community. Without them, this game wouldn't be good enough to use for toliet paper. Until 2K starts putting effort into their products, I will continue to share with others how utterly terrible this game is. If you want to waste your money and don't have anything better to do, then you should buy this game. If you enjoy half-baked ideas with very little effort put into them, then you should buy this game. If you like severe limitations and no reason to care about the ""important"" choices you made throughout the game, then this game is for you. If you enjoy not being able to differentiate terrain types, unit types, or map types, then this game is for you. If you enjoy relying on user-made additions for the game to even be decent enough to tolerate in short durations, then this game is for you. If you have a lick of common sense, do NOT buy this game until the untold amounts of paid bloatware make this game somewhat entertaining.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Beyond Earth (BE) is quite an ambitious combo of words in an ambitious franchise. But it is beyond Alpha Centauri (AC) or the CIV V really?As far I can see, a surprisingly big number of players seem to be disappointed. That made me absolutely curious about this game. I played AC a lot back in time and wanted to find out how BE works. After winning the first BE campaign, I think it did the homework quite well. AC did it a little better for its time but I don't think it is a reason for hate. Yes it is CIV V with aliens. Okay but what did you suspect anyway? In the core it is just as CIV V as AC was CIV II. Some things are modified to fit the sci-fi genre, there is more emphasis on barbarians... er... aliens, there is different mechanics and some base rules are altered, you have to use different battle tactics because of the new type of units and so on.About the rule changes, what it does really well is creating some sci-fi atmosphere. Also it puts the emphasis on exploration instead of development as it has more content on the scenery and less  in the technology tree that feels simplified when I think of CIV V. That's not a good or bad thing, just an alteration of rules. The development of tehcnologies adds a different route and dealing with the environment adds a different taste compared to CIV V.The area where BE lacks is the opponents AI. Both dimplomacy options and AI reactions feel reduced so if you play CIV games for the realistic AI opponents, it is not your game. The fellow leaders are quite predictable and there are much less ways to deal with situations than in CIV V (or AC, per se). When I played CIV V or AC, I had the feeling that the opposing leaders / fractions are up to something, make unpredicable moves and so on. There was only one predictable leader in AC, some religious redhead called Miriam or what, she kept on attacking mindlessly my fraction whatever decisions I made from game to game. In CIV V the leaders behave more to their personalities. In BE they react sort of similar to each other, they are flat and there are some not so reasonable reactions (e.g. attacking a huge empire of a powerful leader with supreme force (khm...) after a peace treaty expired when only one city and a couple of units remained for them).So, as for a final verdict: - Did CIV V offer more? Slightly, I wish BE had better AI.- Was AC better? The AI and mechanincs were and it had some sense of humour.- Is BE a bad game? Definitely not. - Am I disappointed? I wouldn't say. I expected a sci-fi themed game on CIV V engine with some new twists and it is exacty like that.- Am I♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off? I'm not angry at all. It is just a game.- Was it fun? In its way, it was.Although I miss a little more realistic AI and I like it less than CIV V overall (mind that it is one of the most popular CIV games for a reason, right?) - there is no hate from me at all. Give it a try.I can see why it did not match the expectations of a big portion of players but I still can't understand the hate wave phenomenon. There are much worse games out there with much lower hate rate. In a way, the game was not disappointing - the reviews were as they suggest something much worse than the reality. I do question if a game can be judged by the reviews at all. Now that I'm writing a review...It is just a game. If your expectations are unrealisticly high and you don't know what you want (everyone knew that it will be a sci-fi themed game on CIV V engine, right?), it is impossible to satisfy them. Maybe it is not the game that goes wrong.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Just one more turn... ? Nah....Honestly finishing my playthrough in Civ:BE has to be one of the most bland experiences i had in a civilization game. It was mostly just ""city building"" and getting to know the new techs etc, while searching through the ugly UI for infos. Ah yes, and clicking tedious trading routes again and again, as well as always the same stupid diplomatic null messages of some very generic leaders, which were already annoying in CiV.I had no war or any great interaction with other civs (except against those pesky aliens, which always pop up if you leave some empty space - which is unavoidable on the ""borders""), the AI just kept begging me, mixed with the occasional dennounciation (hopping from friendly to guarded back and forth).Empire building is limited due to the ""health"" factor (was happiness in CiV), which annoyingly begins to deteriorate already after your second or at least third city.Much is similiar to CiV, but with a worse overview for the player or/and less variety. For example you only have around five standard unit types, mixed in with up to three or so special types for your kind of specialization. The units also get small extras for your ""affinity"", blocking the other types at the same time. The affinity specialisation also contributes a big part to which victory condition you can fulfill.Sadly these conditions (as is much of the whole techtree) are hard to differentiate and just have a bad overview imo.This is especially sad since the affinity, combined with the quest system and the possibility/requirement to focus your tech research are the main new gameplay elements imo. There also is a new orbit view in which you can use different satellites, but i honestly found them mostly useless.So, in the end, you have a CiV 1.5 in space, with a terrible UI and interface, a few new elements, many old ones (sadly also the annoying ones).. and - for me at least - much tedious work, instead of fun gameplay.Will keep watching this game (especially if the modders, once again, can rescue a game), but can´t see me playing it again in the near future.. which really is a shame for a civilisation game.ps: yes, and the ai movement still sucks too...

												I revisited this game after giving up on it at release due to the awful diplomacy bugs.  I wanted to see if it had been fixed, what with the overhaul the Rising Tide DLC included.I'm still playing this without the DLC because it costs almost as much as the base game which itself feels more like a reskin of Civ 5 than a full game in its own right.  Barbarians became aliens, nationstates became stations, the resources have different names, money became energy, happiness became health and luxury resources are gone completely.  The only things that have changed in any significant way are idealogical progression using ""affinity"" points earned through research choices and quest paths and technology progression itself.Where the research path in Civ 5 takes the form of a horizontal tree, limiting you into 4 or 5 research options at a time, BE's progression is a radial tree with each branch having a few ""leaf"" research options attached to it as well as unlocking access to another branch or two.  This provides significant freedom in research path and allows some interesting tactical choices.  Researching toward particular goals is encouraged - work toward a particular building, unit or wonder you're in need of or focus on research options that will increase a particular affinity.The affinity system is the only thing preventing players from charging toward end-game units immediately.  Unit upgrades (equivalent to the change from an archer to a crossbowman in Civ 5) come from your highest of the three affinities - environmentalist Harmony, technological Supremacy and traditionalist Purity.  Each has its own distinct style of unit and unlocks specialist buildings and affinity-specific units.  It's likely that you'll gain a few levels in each of the affinities on a playthrough but getting access to strong units quickly requires researching options that increase a chosen affinity (best selected based on which of the three main alien resources you have access to in greatest abundance - xenomass for harmony, firaxite for supremacy or floatstone for purity) which means skipping research that would give you new buildings or wonders.  That aspect of the game, adapting your research strategy to the game conditions, is quite well done.Diplomacy is a mess.  It was at release and, while I didn't have a denouncement cascade in my recent playthrough, it's still rather bugridden.  It would appear that in order to fix a bug that allowed you to take all of a civilization's assets in exchange for a single favour by modifying a recurring deal when the civ asks to extend it they've created a situation where civs will reject their own offers.  ""Guarded"" leaders will pop up with a request of energy in exchange for a favour and, should you accept, will decide the deal isn't good enough.It's very hard to decide whether to recommend this game or not.  Given that the only thing in its favour is the tech tree, I'm going to have to lean toward no on this one.			",102,23,0,19,13,0,15

												I loved Civ 1,3,4,5. I tried to like this game. I played a few games of it and left it on overnight a couple of times (probably have played closer to 18 hours than 35). It just didn't grab me. It's disappointing all-round and not worth buying. I'd say maybe get it when it falls to 10 dollars and you're REALLY in love with the civ franchise. Otherwise please buy Civ V with the Brave New World expansion if you want to play a good game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												1/9/2015 - Currently, this game has little character. I played it for a while and then wanted to go back to Civ5. This will likely improve as new expansions are added, and you still have a feeling of ""one more turn..."" but there is very little satisfaction in defeating an enemy or completing a wonder, as everything feels bland and the same.

												I am quite dissapointed, I've put hundreds of hours into its predecessors, and was looking forward to another take on Alpha Centauri with updated Civ 5 Mechanics. Here are my opinions after 78 hours.The main thing I have against this game is it'd linearity despite its attempts to spread the tech tree and offer more varied victory conditions. Its all basically research a few things to improve research generation, then rush 2-3 techs into your main vicory based techs to start building a tedious waiting-game based wonder. This may have been balanced if the AI was made to attack when you're about to win, but it just placidly sits by and lets you win without a struggle, even as global announcements state that ""X has built Y!!!"", they dont react.Trade based research generation is very unbalanced, especially in harder modes where the AI has tech boosts. All I had to do was build as many cities and trade vessels as I could and not build too close to my opponents. There is a basic building that makes your trade vessels immune to aliens, allowing you to have far too much energy ($) & research. The negative health (sort of like civ 5 happiness) effects of spamming cities is negligible compared to the benefits of more trade vessels, and once tech gets good enough, you just buy all the buildings with your hoard of money to abruptly fix all health issues.I won on Apollo -the hardest difficulty- on my first try of it, without anyone declaring war on me. The game does suffer from not having the bulk of human history as flavour, but that may have been remedied by adding more ""sponsor"" based flavouring, the logs and encyclopedia were actually very well written, but the game just does'nt present it in either an easily legible or interesting fashion.I'll check it out after a patch because based on Firaxis' prior games, I know they can make this work, but as it currently stands, I cannot readily reccomend this game. -Nov 13 2014			",113,35,0,14,22,1,38

												The short version of this review is this: They didn't even bother to give us the little video at the end of the game that shows the growth of all the civs. That's pure laziness right there, and was the final straw on the giant haystack that broke this camel's back.This game is just so obviously incomplete, it's kind of a joke. It wouldn't run on my desktop for the first 2 months (it ran great on my laptop, but it doesn't have the power to have the graphics turned up), until they released the major patch a couple weeks ago. But the major patch didn't really fix any of the issues I had with it except making it take a lot longer to crash. The biggest issue I have with the game is that it's the Civ V engine, but while Civ V had an amazingly simple but effective interface, BE has a neutered, confusing UI, and beyond that, it's missing a lot of the informational tools from Civ V. Like, all of them. There are no advisors, there's no way to see how you're doing compared to the other players beyond score, which is a fairly useless metric. Trade Routes are completely jumbled, with no way to sort them properly to see which ones are best. And the thought of being able to combine the various starting benefits to make your own civ turns out to be much better in theory than in fact. I have no idea what civ I am in any given game, because I really don't care. The benefits don't really change the way you play the game at all. On top of all of that, some of the stuff that Civ V didn't do as well as Civ IV, like diplomacy, is even worse in BE. Most of the time, I forget entirely about the other Civs. There aren't any ""luxury resources"" to give you some motivatoin to trade with them. I have no idea what Favors might be able to do, but I've never been able to get one anyway, so that doesn't matter. Wonders are utterly useless. Not only are most of them no better than a regular building, but you also have to research a tech that does nothing but let you build the wonder in order to do so. The one thing they did that's way better is improve the espionage stuff. But even that wasn't perfect, as it seems to be impossible to get a city to have an intrigue level higher than 2.

												First of all I must acknowledge that I might be a bit biased in favor of “Beyond Earth”. I love science-fiction and all things robots, genetic manipulation and space. I'm a true disciple of strategy games and especially of the turn-based variety and quite the veteran of many, many rounds of “Alpha Centauri”. I've been very hypedThis said as introduction I'd first like to say that I like the design of Civilization 5, although I consider it a seriously dumbed down game, up to the point of it being the mentally handicapped little brother of its predecessors. But is it fair to use such harsh words? Maybe I should come to peace with the fact that Civilization 5 just isn't the same as the other games and in certain ways it did improve. Despite being dumbed down it isn't an easy game to master when you face human players that operate with the same meta as you. So it didn't get boring too quickly.“Beyond Earth” kept the best of Civilization 5 (nonstackable units are debatable) and added a whole bucket of goodness to create a truly amazing game with an atmosphere that puts your mind at peace, while focused on the task that lies before you: survive on an alien world.I love the addition of the affinity system which visually expresses the philosophy you embrace, which means you either play as Col. Quaritch, Robocop or Ray Kurzweil. Additionally you can select virtues divided into might, prosperity, knowledge and industry (basically a different sort of social policy system, but improved as it rewards both beelining as well as grabbing many boni from one section, or combining sections as well as tiers... and so on). I'd wish for “hybrid” affinities that let you embrace 2 main affinities for special units, but I don't see the developers doing that anytime soon. One can still embrace 2 affinities, in rare cases it even pays off (for example the Prime version of the Aegis mech of the purity affinity [Humanity ♥♥♥♥ YEAH!] needs 10 purity affinity and 3 supremacy affinity [resistance is futile, puny meatbags!]. I found out that for units it pays to have up to 5 affinity levels of a secondary affinity, however affinity influences much more than just units, so I'll have to experiment around a bit. I for one enjoyed going Purity as my primary affinity and Supremacy as my secondary affinity in my first game.Beyond Earth added quests, better neutral city state mechanics (called stations now), better barbarian mechanics (b-but aliens aren't barbarians! They are different! Yes they are. This makes it better, dear reader. That's what I talk about!), better victory conditions and it feels much better writing possible future history, instead of reenacting history in the most ludicrous ways (nuking ancient Egyptians as Gandhi!). AND SPACE COLONIZATION! Is that nothing?Last but not least you select your colonists' loadout: that is sponsor, equipment and type of colonists. This is a very great addition as it lets you customize your starting conditions in a more unique way than in Civ 5, adds the feeling that you have more control and ownership over your colonists and allows different strategies instead. We'll see more than a couple of viable strategies that will be quite different to each others. A bit irritating is the fact that the sponsors do not include a Northern European race. Sure, Russians are Caucasoid, but so are some North Africans strictly speaking. I'll play the French for now. What I am missing is a member of one of the Nordic, Anglo Saxon and Germanic race. It is quite likely they'll send people to space, although the developer might have wanted to show us a grimdark future where mass immigration replaced the European people almost completely with the grand daughter of Marine Le Pen leading the last Front National enclave of the French into space. Who knows.Apart from this the personalities and background of the sponsors don't appeal to me. They are quite bland persons. That said it allows the player to use his imagination more. Still given how fleshed out the characters are, one could imagine them to be at least a bit interesting. Yet they are not. The most important issue however is balance. So far I believe all sponsors have their viable ways of working well, so as of now I think Firaxis did that one well.I could drone on a bit more but this is lost time that I could have used playing this game! Do I recommend it? Yes, I do. The atmosphere is just great. The scifi turn-based strategy genre is quite sparsely populated so even a game with some imperfections would get a rather positive review from me. I think Beyond Earth actually earns the good vote. It's not actually a breathtaking game, but while it looks like a small step for the turn-based strategy genre, it is a great step from Civ 5.7.5/10 – It's okay.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While I enjoy the new aesthetic and premise of this new title, this feels an awful lot like Civ Lite. The Sponsers don't have any personality like in previous Civ games and their bonuses feel fairly Lack-lustre. Affinities are cool, especially how it changes the architecture of your cities and have cool unique units who's aesthetic reflects the sponsor's primary affinity, but otherwise feel fairly similar to eachother in terms of abilities. The fact that i can get all the affinity bonuses for each affinity in a single playthrough feels a bit unvaried and cheap to me, turning a mechanic that should spawn personality and individuality for a particuluar Civ in a playthrough, instead allow players to form this souless, homogenous glump with no distinct trait; it's bad enough that the Civs (or Sponsors, i should say) already have no personality, but the affinities just turn that into a soulless void. Otherwise, mostly everything else feels like Civ 5, which is good; but then again, i'd rather play Civ 5 if i wanted to feel like i'm playing Civ 5. For Civ veterans who own every bit of DLC for Civ 5, i'd just recommend sticking to that, IMHO. For new-comers to Civ, Beyond Earth is a fine introduction to Civ. Similar mechanics to Civ 5 make it a good stepping stone for those that may look at getting into previous Civilization games. Overall though, Beyond Earth feels a bit empty for me. Perhaps in a later patch or DLC they may add stuff that will bring me back into it, but otherwise, i'm sticking to Civ 5 for now.			",173,20,3,10,13,1,35

												It all comes down to one question: Is the game fun?The answer is, No.Pros:-Core Civ mechanics are there-Graphics are pretty, at first-The tech web is really neat-Unit upgrades look goodCons:-Feels like a chore-Everything starts to blend together-No unit diversity in the build que-AI goes from ""Dumb as a rock"" to ""ROFLstomp"" suddenly in difficulty-Questing system is stale, with no real replay value-Health system is still broken (Not as bad as from launch)Ok, so if you're still here I'll explain. I've put in over 300 hours in Civ 5, and I was very excited for this game at launch. I played several games when it launched, but never had any fun. I've come back to it every few months to start games, but I simply didn't have enough fun to go beyond turn 160 or so.It's been enough time that I decided to try it again. . . And it still isn't fun for the reasons listed above. Although the DLC looks great, and yes I've watched several people play the media demos, it makes me feel betrayed. I spent a time and money on this game, and what should have been a major patch seems to be going into the DLC instead.I hope the DLC makes the game fun. But, I'm not getting it until it is on a major discount (like 5 bucks). Until then, I can't recommend this game to anyone that enjoys other Civ games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As a classic CIV game player and after playing through Civ:BE once the impression so far can be summed up in the word ""void"". And not in the sense of the vast void of exciting and unexplored outer space, but more of completely devoid of content and soul.There is nothing there to grab ones attention. It is CIV in space, so far fair and fun enough but there is nothing there to keep the interest burning. The alien planet is interesting in the beginning but quickly becomes plain. The small stories (quests) are entertaning and spark ones imagination, for a while. It is simply CIV in space with earth resources such as marble and bananas swapped with potatoelike tubes and firaxite. Without the history of real earth, which supports CIV on Earth, the game quickly feels like a generic CIV. The current storyline and tweaks compared to CIV on Earth is not enough to keep it afloat. If this was created by modders for free it would be really impressing. But as a full price corporate game one feels almost cheated paying for it.If you like CIV and space buy it on discount, but only after they released anyform of DLC to fill out the glaring gaps.

												Latest patch (Fall season) that was supposed to fix all the previous problems entirely broke a perfectly working installation on my system. I can't create a new game, nor load a saved game.  Nothing else has changed except this patch that I couldn't choose to NOT install, nor revert. Considering how long it'll take 2K to get around to even recognize this issue (based on their last record of 2+ months), DO NOT attempt to look at this game for at least another year until some heads at 2K roll.

Really boring game, and this is coming from the guy who spent hundreds of hours on civ 5. )Multiplayer is glitchy)Beat it once;I didnt feel the urge to do it again like with civ 5)This game was way too hyped up for its own good)The UI goes for the futuristic and minimalist approach but imo doesnt really work well)The terrain is boring- pretty much everything is grey)I especially hate the new diplomacy screens. In civ 5, you had the grand courtroom of Rome with beautiful statues; Atilla's tent stocked with weapons; India's peaceful seas. yet here you have just a leader speaking half english half native language in the middle of your screen, and as a native hindi speaker kavita really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off , with my general consensus being 'PICK ONE ALREADY STOP SWITCHING BETWEEN LANGUAGES')The Alien's are really annoying and useless. They're either everywhere and you cant do anything without getting smashed,  or you're so far ahead they're irrelevant. There's no progression or middle ground.)The tech web is really annoying. You either beeline for an expensive tech than clean up useless techs that dont really do much or pick a bunch of small techs and get left behind)The ♥♥♥♥ing wonders. God. Half the time you cant even tell if thats a building or a wonder you're researching.If you havent played civ 5, picture this In Civ 5 = Beautiful oil painting depicting the wonder you built, grand music playing, A historical quote that relates to your wonder and a description of what it doesIn Civ 6 = You get a blueprint of what you built.)This one is really opinionated, but I prefer the soothing deep voice reading me a historical quote I never knew about rather than some woman half heartedly speaking some lines.)Game winning screen is not satisfying at all. Before you had an oil painting of your victory type (which is still here tbf), a quote stating your greatness read by a calming voice, along with demographics, a score comparison to historical leader and a map replay. In this game its just ,you won. Yay. Cool.Rant over.Sorry if I come across as a bit of an♥♥♥♥♥ I blame the fact that this was something I was excited for over a year and it fell flat on its face.TL;DR buy civ 5 in a sale and wait for DLC to save this game.

												One word to describe Civ: Beyond Earth?Yawn... boring.Having played and loved every Civ game since the first, I must say this game was a big dissapointment. It is basically a mod of the last Civ release with little added and a lot taken away. There is really no challenge in the game, no... point. You don't ever really have any sense of purpose to the missions and goals other than the fact that it is what you are supposed to do. The game basically becomes a single line path to reach a research goal ahead of everyone else and win. There is no creativity or flexibility in it and ultimately no real purpose. The final end screen sort of sums up the whole game - when a side wins, it just dumps you out of the game. No summary, no evaluation of your performance, and if it is not you who won, no information on who did win. The conclusion is as dull as the game. It seems that even the AI itself is bored and just couldn't be bothered. A bit like playing poker with Marvin the android... Skip it, go play Civ Revolution - even that was more exciting...

												An incomplete game and a blatant cash grab riding off Civ V's hype. This is a bait and switch more than anything. At first they hint that it's inspired by Alpha Centauri. Then after release they say that it never had anything to do with it. The only problem is pretty much every single review or interview before and after release brings it up. The diplomacy is simply cut and pasted from Civ V. There is a complete lack of effort. If you fire up Alpha Centauri the sounds are awesome you feel immersed. When you play this there is no bond to it the factions have zero personalities. You will see lines like, ""Once bitten twice shy."" I can't recommend this to anyone. If I had any recommendation it would be to not buy this until all DLC have been released and you can pick it up for $5. Those that already own it wait for the complete version to purchase any more DLC. Otherwise, you just encourage this behavior and you'll continue to get burned.			",364,70,20,49,60,14,96

												I'm very sad to have to say this, but as it stands, Beyond Earth is a bland version of Civ 5 with a better tech tree and differently skinned barbarians (aka aliens).  It lacks any of the historical connection that Civ 5 has, which means the technologies are very generic.  I've never been faced with such a disconnected choice, like, do I want the generic +1 health or the +1 power building.  And half the Wonders I could not even tell what they were supposed to be at all, other than their stats.  The units suffer from an excessivly generic issue, as well.  In an attempt to simplify the various unit types, you upgrade existing units throughout the game.  Unfortunately, this leads to questions like ""What was the Arbiter again?  Was that a boat, a melee infantry, or rocket artillery?""As many have said, they retained so much of Civ 5 game that it feels like a reskin of the base game.  While that is not in of itself a bad thing (Civ 5 is great, afterall), they kept too much and what they did change, they made only modest advencements, leaving us with a overpriced, bland, generic sci-fi reskin of a popular game.

												Overall: DISSAPOINTING (yet with a lot of potential)...This could have been an amazing installement of Civ franchise but unfortunaely too many things were not done right.Game looks nice and plays really well but there are flaws that just break the game:- BALANCE is terrible, in some games there is not even a reason for waging wars- AI is crap, come civs dont even build up beyond their first city (and I am talking of harder difficulties like soyuz and up)- Wonders are still underpowered and really sad in most cases-- Way too few nations - and no choice of selecting more than 8 in singleplayer- small stuff that were not fixed since release like CNDR buggy low texture fire animation- NO constant improvement as it was the case for Civ5 which changed its mechanics ENTIRELY over the years- Spy ""siphon credits"" mission still giving a tons of cash wrecking balance for everyone as you end up with mocr energy you can spend on buildings...If above (and more I missed) issues could be fixed, the game has a pontential for being a really good game!Until then, can't recommend as overal there are too many game breaking/unbalanced aspects of it.

												This game looks as a Civ5 DLC, nothing more. I do not know how it may have so many positive reviews from so-called ""experts"". Nothing impressive, nothing innovative, nothing new in game mechanics. Moreover, this game is full of technical issues and errors. For example, owners of high refresh rate monitors (120hz, 144hz...) can not play full screen in full hd (1920x1080). Since the release of the game had passed two weeks, but the error is still not fixed.I do not suggest to buy this game, just play Civ5 better. Also I suggest not to buy anything from Firaxis for at least two-three weeks after release. Better wait until they will fix tons of bugs. Also read ""real"" user reviews, not those from ""experts"" before deciding whether to buy the game or not.			",39,4,2,9,6,1,9

												One step forward two steps back.Still a solid 4x title but for the asking price it doesn't offer a lot (assuming you've already played Civ5). Problems such as the terrible ai diplomacy system still exist, visuals haven't been updated and while the setting is interesting the new factions are very bland. Some odd UI and design choices create a some frustrating micromanagement and a severe lack of information in terms of game victory progress.Overpriced and underwhelming, wait for a sale and go check out Amplitude's Endless Legend instead. You can tell they care a lot more about their game and won't try to milk your pennies with DLC.			",682,149,50,117,99,12,186

												I cannot in good faith recommend this game right now, even if I do enjoy it. Much like Civ 5 upon release, this game is not finished. I have no doubt it will be improved upon with the future expansions as there are some great ideas in here that could be amazing with a little bit of TLC. Right now, this is very much a spin-off of Civ 5 as opposed to a sequel. Many assets from 5 were reused (mainly the hill and ice tiles). The biggest problem though, is the lack of strong civilizations. Being set in the future, all the leaders are fictional and not memorable at all. The only one I ever remember is ""that guy who looks like John C. Reilly"". The civs abilities aren't very memorable either, as the ""create your own"" civilization at the beginning of a game just makes it feel like everything is homogenized.There are a few positives though, the new tech tree is very fun once you get used to it. The need to constantly upgrade your militairy units is gone thanks to a new affinity based unit promotion tree. This leaves you with just the basic unit types which you can specialize as the game progresses. The new policy trees are great too, incentivizing both branching across multiple trees and focusing on one.I think the most important fault of BE is the victories. Other than the Domination-esque victory of capturing all capitals, the others are just sitting around and waiting, making for a really boring Next-Turn button simulator.In conclusion, wait till the expansions come out. BNW and G&K really improved Civ 5, and I have high hopes that the same will happen for BE. Until then, just buy the complete addition of 5 if you want some Civ.			",148,31,0,20,19,0,30

												I jumped on board the Civilization train when Civ2 came out. Since then, I have been a dedicated fan on the series, and in fact all of firaxis' works since then. I even played that facebook civ, which was surprisingly good (except for the constant puzzles). Yet.. this is the first civilization game for which I have felt compelled to leave a review..As much as it pains me to say, this Civ release does not merit a full title price tag. In terms of gameplay, Civ:Beyond Earth does in fact feel like a glorified mod of Civ5, and not the best one either. The new sci-fi graphics and sound are very nice and well done. Graphically, the game looks much better than civ 5, even though this may not be apparent in screenshots.. however this is not enough to cover up the fact that the core game underneath it all is quite boring.Though the affinity and starting condition customizations seem like a huge step forward for the franchise, they actually take away all sense of identity for individual players. The AI civs have been axed even further due to the fact that they have a lot less dialogue and options of interaction. The lack of technological ages and culturally themed buildings also detract from the sense of character that the game has. The overall result of the gameplay changes in Civ Beyond Earth make the game feel like a mad dash towards a specific goal. This is very different from the epic, multi-staged journey that civ fans expect. I found it very hard to become attached to my civ, or to care much about winning, as the game quickly becomes a ""assign production and trade routes, end turn and repeat cycle."" The devs on this game admit to being fans of Endless Space, and the game actually suffers from the same major flaw.. of being extremely well polished, functional, and pretty, but utterly devoid of character.The flow of the game feels very bland, especially in comparison to the brave new world expansion for civ 5. Being on an alien world provides the game developers with a virtually unlimited number of interesting scenarios to throw at the player, thanks to decades of accumulated fiction that can be drawn upon. Instead, the game presents all of that intrigue in the form of a box of flavor text each time you build a new type of building. Among some other missed opportunities that are uniquely available to the setting of beyond earth which were missed are.. Under-water or subterranean settlement, more robust and fleshed out space units, natural wonders and catastrophes, sci-fi themed luxury resources.All in all, this game was a letdown, and quite overrated. Lets hope Civ6 brings a more memorable experience to the table.EDIT: The AI's aggression needs to be fixed. They are far too passive. I have played 3 games and the only war I have been a part of thus far was one of my own making. EDIT2: The game lacks a victory summary.. of any kind. What is up with that?? Seriously.

												It's not a bad game, but honestly it is better descripted as a Civ 5 expansion pack than a stand alone game. The leaders have no personality to speak of, the world is a mostly blue green mass of indistinguishable tiles, and while it probably shouldn't be compared to SMAC it doesn't compare well. The only thing superior to the 15 year old game is the graphics and wide screen support.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If I were Sid Meiers, I would sue for personal defamation....IT'S PAINFUL TO NOT REC THIS!!  As a life long fan of this series, this is the only Civilization game i have played which was simply put: not fun.  The game is incredibly easy yet annoying.  It also feels cheaply done.  Whoever was in charge of this project has seriously hurt the value of the brand here by putting out such a poor product under an acclaimed series.  I just did my first playthrough (normal difficulty) and won.  Not by a small margin but the faction in 2nd place was earning around +20 energy and 60 science per turn at the end.  I was earning +250 energy and well over 400 science per turn....(and this was net of my workers building the most expensive terrain upgrades possible).  I was never attacked.  I never witnessed an attack except that the other countries would randomly send 2 units to attack a 3rd party post.  No, they never destroyed it despite the countries having massive militaries lying in their borders.  They just randomly attacked them and then withdrew.  This was all the action i saw....and i never felt threatened.  I read reviews of the AI's passivity before playing so I spent next to nothing on military units early game.....and nobody ever attacked me.  The aliens.....there is essentially no point to them.  You leave them alone and they will leave you alone.  I had one worker (who was travelling far outside of my borders) killed.  That's it.Trade routes - you will have nightmares about these.  They say a boat owner's two happiest days are when he gets his boat....and when he gets rid of his boat.  It was great when I realized that i would have an endless supply of energy (gold) from my trade routes but then.....they just wouldn't leave me alone!!!!!!!!  Every 20 turns you will be asked to scan through a MASSIVE list of every city know to the futuristic human race to pick out the most attractive trade route.  Now multiply this by the number of cities you have and then times 2 again (some cases 3).  This is essentially what you will be doing for most of your time in this game.....picking damn trade routes.  By the end of the game, you will wish you never had them. Affinities......terribly executed.  I went the alien / xenomass route (i cant even remember the name) and it just feels totally pointless which one was my dominant affinity as i ended up having high levels in the other 2 with access to most of their units.  In no way did my affinity dictate my style of play except that i had to hunt for more xenomass strategic resources.  Essentially each affinity leans more so on one resource but other than that - they all get their own graphic and name for troops which are mostly the same.   There are many other problems with this game but you get the idea.  Obviouslly there was a severe flaw in the project team overseeing this.......what a shame.  This feels like an early beta for a game as it has such massive obvious flaws in the AI, game balance and enjoyability.  Sorry, Sid!			",3,2,0,3,6,0,15

												After spending quite some time with CivBE, I have come away feeling disappointed. First and foremost, this game is not different enough from Civ 5 to be all that interesting if you have played it. While there are some fundamental differences (the web tech tree being the biggest change), it's essentially still the same game. If you were bored or played out with Civ 5, it won't take long to get that way again with CivBE.Second, while the endings in Civ games has always been one of the weaker points of the game (I've been playing them since Civ2), this one takes the cake by not only being lackluster, but now also confusing. There is simply too much of the game's story buried in the help section (which you have to manually go and read). Descriptions of the three ""paths"" you can choose from are not well presented, progression in them suffers from a lack of narration, and  the special victory conditions from them are a complete mystery if you don't wan to go into the help files and read what they are. There's an almost complete lack of immersion in the story, to the point where you can actually accidentally progress to the faction victory and not even realize you had done so if you are just working on building your civ. In contrast, this games's spiritual predecessor, Alpha Centauri, has voiceovers throughout giving flavor to the techs you are building, and interludes that pop up explaining the story progression of the game, giving you a clue you were heading in the right direction for a win. CivBE is a decided step backwards in storytelling.Third, the actual tech and units in the game are boring and unappealing. Wonders are just stat bonuses with random fururistic sounding names - nothing to make them feel wonderous happens at all when you build them. Combat units are just the same as their Civ5 counterparts with different names. In Alpha Centauri, each unit and wonder felt like a unique item, with a purpose. You could customize each soldier or tank with new armor, weapons, and abilities - each unit could be unique, or you could spend the money to upgrade them. In CivBE, you literally get to choose between two options when you upgrade a unit, and all units are automatically given that change - no matter how far away they are on the planet. Your units aren't even color coded to your nation, leading to confusion when invading enemies move into your territory. It's boring, and it's badly designed and implemented.Lastly, the game is buggy. You can read threads here about how many people have crash issues, or can't run the game at all. I personally have to run the game in a window because my 120hz monitor isn't supported by the game. Not even a ""windowed full screen"" mode like most games have these days - an actual window mode with a title bar. Given the game is basically Civ5 with a new skin in most ways, for bugs like this to make it into a retail release is inexcusable. Any decent  amount of QA would have found some of these bugs, and it's readily apparent that another month cooking would have done wonders for CivBE, but as is the case in so many games this year, getting the game into stores before Christmas was obviously more important to Firaxis than delivering a game that actually runs. To make matters worse, we are several weeks past launch now and there has not been a single patch released.This game has not just made me sad about the state of games today, but has actually made me vow to never pre-order another game that has a launch date after September 1st. The game devs have no reason to deliver a good game experience to us unless we stand up and let our dollars do the talking.			",211,48,1,40,16,1,58

												I really wish there was a way to rate between recommended and not recommended because this isn't a bad game at all. It's just a bit too similar to civ V for me to feel like I really got what I paid for. It's worth it if you're a diehard civ fan, like complex games or if it's on sale. It's just not worth it for the full price. This review takes into account the purchase of  Rising Tides (the dlc) as that's the only way I've played the game.Pros: +Nice music, and the interfaces and biomes look amazing. +There is a lot of detail put into the backstory.+The orbital layer is an interesting add on to the map. +Affinities are used throughout the game instead of being picked up midgame as it was in civ V, which I preferred. +The Tech web is a really interesting system and the sub-layers in the tech web really add to the game. +The quests, artefacts and exploration sites were a cool addition. +Sea cities+The diplomacy deals add a dynamic to the game that I really liked and were a really neat concept. +Outposts are founded before cities+I liked all of the different options for biomes and planet types.Cons-The map is really hard to see. This sounds sort of minor, but it was really hard to tell the difference between ocean, land, and unexplored areas and it bugged me a little.-While a cool concept, I found the orbital layer really useless. -I found I always had to level up affinities I didn't want to level up in order to do research I needed, so I found it really difficult to focus on one particular affinity.-There are way too many bonus resources, so many that I sort of lost track of all of them and they became trivial because I had no idea which ones did what. -There are way too many techs, and it's hard to tell a lot of them apart. -The virtue trees are just the social policy trees from tech five, but with fewer options. I didn't have a huge problem with the civ V similarity, but only four braches wasn't enough.-Near the end of the game, I found there were way too many unit and building options. Since the names are all futuristic it was hard to tell what any of them were supposed to do as well as being hard to tell apart. -It's hard to tell how many trade routes are active at any one point in time-There's no demographic bar. It's kind of a minor complaint, but I like being able to see how I stand in comparison with other leaders. -There are very few options for different civs. While the ones they have are well-developped and have decent benefits, it would have been nice to see some more options. Part of what made me like civ V so much was the number of civs to pick from, and Beyond Earth just doesn't have the same number of options.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My opinions are similar to many.  Civ:BE is a half-finished Firaxis game.  The final product (with all the DLCs) will most likely be amazing and worth playing for hours, but right now it is a disappointing game and not worth the money.  Please, do yourself a favor and save your money, at least until it goes on a 40% off sale.This game does not have a soul like most Firaxis games do.  I just cannot get invested in the characters.  I feel like I'm going through the motions of Civ:BE but am still thinking of Civ V.  I feel bad because I so wanted to fall in love with Civ:BE, but it is just a shell of a game.I have a bunch of little issues with the UI, especially the diplomacy screen.  Can they not incorporate InfoAddict to the game?  I want to KNOW everything I have and the other trades I'm engaged in before saying yes to an offer.  Currently, I have to decide blindly because I haven't memorized it all.  Come on, Firaxis!  Just add a little button in the corner to give us access to this!I cannot recommend this game currently though I so want to.  I love Firaxis, but this game again is a shell of a game without a soul.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have never written a game review before, but here I felt I had to do it. My main language is not english, so sry for any typos. I am a staunch Civilization player. I have played all the games and even played Civ1 on a emulator on my computer just for the feel of it.I have never in my life counted down the days for a game release like I did with this one, and I have never been so disapointed in my life before.-The game is basically a tasteless reskin of Civ5 (yes it is). -The AI is horrible-The diplomatic characters and diplomacy window are/is tasteless and boring.-The game, characters, civilizations lack a proper background story, to much is left for the imagination. -Aliens are a moderated form for barbarians (yes they are, just because they get more or less angry at you, dont give them any more personality than barbarians. There is so much more FIraxis could have done with the concept of aliens living on a future planet than this)-The tech map is a cheap rip off from another sci-fi game, It lacks proper icons and pictures like in other CIV games-The indian girl reading lines is annoying and considering that all the lines are made up from future great persons make the game really unpersonal to me. -The auto function for the workers is heavily bugged. THey end up doing the same actions again and again, miasma blocks roads when they could simply build around.-The trade function on larger games is tedious as you have to chose the same route or new one over and oaver again after a fixed number of turns. There is no function to tell the trade vessel ""stay ont hat route, dont ask me again"". -It lacks videos and graphics (hell even the first awesome trailer movies are not included in the game!), -When you build buildings in CIV 5, you see nice small icons/pictures that represent that building, but not in this game, it looks like Firaxis made their outmost best to do less work on this game. -When you finish the game, it basically pops up a small cheap painting with an indian girl reading two lines (no stats, no videos, no nothing.. wow.. talk about wanting to play again..)-The game should have included the Progenitor race returning and the factions having a battle against them or becoming allies with them (but I bet Firaxis and 2K will launch this as an expansion for the sake of money)-The affinity system gives the game some originality, but it grows old to fast. -Has no wonder videos or neat graphics, just a simple architect like scetch of each wonder you build.. they could have done so much more visually.. I mean a wonder is a WONDER.. it should really make the player feel that he/she really built something awesome, instead you feel.. I dont know.. disconnected.Im not saying dont buy and play. Im just saying, dont buy it for the kind of money they want now. Wait for it to go for the cheap, play it a couple of times, then let it rot on the library list. The game is basically an insult to anyone who plays Civ games and should have been an expansion to Civ5 (which it is) and not a single game. Just saying....			",70,8,0,18,22,1,45

												It's a solid game for any fan of the genre or anyone wanting to suffer from stockholm syndrome.A few things:- Buying tiles en masse feels like a great way to get carpal tunnel syndrome- The interface looks like it could be a little more spacey and it is not that intuitive or much of an improvement from previous games.  A small ""+"" at the bottom next to the other icons doesn't really grab your attention for other key aspects such as military, economic and other overviews....- It's annoying to keep confirming everything.  Yes I want to buy that tile.  Yes I want to trade there.  Yes I want to delete that worker I captured to spite my enemy... people who have a problem second guessing themselves beware.- The victory sequences feel immensely underwhelming and subsequent game summaries don't exist.- No nukes.- Lack of a variety of character leaders or faction distinctions.  Why can't I play an alien civilization and dominate the earth refugee invaders.  ♥♥♥♥ing christ, coming to my planet and ravaging my resources.  ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥es.- I have to keep picking my faction and renaming it every game, it does not roll over or save.- Other than alien species replacing barbarians, the world maps didn't really do anything else than look different with different resources in place of old ones.  Why can't there be a ever present raging storm across the map like on ♥♥♥♥ing Jupiter?  Why can't there be a subterranean level?  Planets can have massive oceans beneath ice?  Where the ♥♥♥♥ did they get their inspiration for this game?  ""Uh, I like how earth looks lets make it look like that"".... Um, ♥♥♥♥ you... I thought this game was called beyond earth.- Barely any story to get you involved.  Might as well call it ""Civilization: We weren't sure which way humanity is going so we left a lot of it open ended"".  Earth used up resources yadda yadda we left etcetera etcetera.... Why couldn't they hire one of those alternative history fiction writers to come up with something?  Seriously, I think my bowl of cheerios is makes a more interesting story and I'm not even hungry.I love the Civilization series and this satisfies the megalomaniac in me but it also just feels like it's just banking on the brand name			",12,0,0,5,2,0,8

												This game is unfinished and suffers some bugs that are also present in CIV V. The aliens were supposed to be meaningful and interact with your advances on the planet but all they are is a slight speedbump. You can commit genocide on them and they still will not change their stance towards you. The aliens don't scale in power and very soon you can crush hordes of them with a single of your units. VERY disapointing. The tech-tree, or rather tech circle, is a very nice change but suffers from balance issues. The units available to the sponsors (equivalent to the different civs in CIV V) have atrocious scaling and in you are a single level behind you'll get steamrolled. The AI is dumb as dirt and is incompetent at every turn. This ""game"" is just a deluxe mod to CIV V but Firaxis charges you as if it was a new independant game. The mechanics are all the same between the games. In CIV you have happiness here you have health, but mechanically it's ALL THE SAME.This game has potential but that potential will probably come in DLC where Firaxis will force you to get a ""complete"" base game but charging you EVEN MORE money. The game is basically in late beta and is just a nice mod to CIV but costs just as much as a new retail game. Firaxis really dropped the ball here. Considering how good they can be this feels like a low priority and lazy cash grab where they suckered SMAC players into getting the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Beyond Earth tried to bring back the Alpha Centauri goodness back from 1999 combined with the strengths of the Civ 5 engine. Unfortunately the effort fails, and fails big time. There are so many holes and short comings in this game, that it's hard where to hard start. Don't get me wrong, the game has generally good mechanics and is visually appealing, but overall it just maybe good, but definitely not a must-pay-game.The biggest drawback is balancing. The game is way, way too easy. In any Civ game before I didn't dare to play the highest difficulty level. Not so in BE. I skipped two or three levels inbetween and played my 4th game at Apollo and won it easily within 180 turns.Currently trade-route-spamming is the most effective way to win/dominate a game. With 3 traderoutes (Auto Plant!), the bonuses you get from trade routes are eclipising any early or mid-game buildings you use in a city. And the boost is enormous. The AI is just too passive. Even on Apollo level it rarely attacks, and if so its forces are too weak to make a prolonged and effective attack work.The aliens, while interesting at the start, soon lose any appeal and become cannon fooder as soon as you build your first affinity specific unit.No proper feedback. I just build a unit or a building, but where?? I have to check the logs to find this information??No in-game videos. I build a wonder, just a textbox. I won the game, just a textbox, and so on ..Would I recommend this game? In the current state (first version; unpatched) I would only recommend it only to the die-hard Civ  fans, and even for those the long-term motivation is minimal due to the lack of balance and challenge. Maybe 6 out 10 would be a fair rating, imho.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Take Civ V, strip away 80% of the content, slap a coat of Sci-Fi paint on it and ship it out the door.Very disappointing.  Beyond Earth should have been sold as a Civ V mod for a fraction of the price.  This game has slightly more content and replayability than the Steampunk DLC released for Civ V.There are only 8 civs to choose from, but that doesn't matter because they are effectively identical anyway.There are only about 8-10 units in the game, and it's the same 8-10 units regardless of which civ you choose.The landscape is crowded with features and resources that have very little purpose.  You can comfortably set your Workers on auto and ignore them.All 5 Victory Paths are Science driven, making everything else largely irrelevant.  Even the Domination Victory depends heavily on the Science resource in order to unlock the automatic upgrades for the 2 or 3 units you will need to win.Trade is crucial to success, but very tedious and not fun at all to manage.  Every turn, I would get 1 or 2 messages from Trade units asking me to confirm that I still want it to keep doing what I told it to do the last 20 times it asked.Diplomacy is irrelevant.  All other Civs can be safely ignored unless you feel like conquering them.  Other leaders will frequently harass you with pointless offers or empty threats, though, and that gets annoying fast.Exploration is largely pointless and unrewarding.  The whole world is one homogenous smear of resources.  Clear out your own little plot of land and don't bother going anywhere else.Seriously, I want my money back on this one.			",6,3,0,5,0,0,6

												Beyond Earth feels more like a Civ 5 expansion than a totally different game, it's not worth the 50 euro asking price. Wait for a 50% off sale (probably for the Winter sale), and then it'll be viable.           I've been playing this game for a quite a few hours, I've tried different affinities and tech combinations, and I do like how they interact and affect your civilization/colonists, but other than that, there's really not much there that sets this game apart from Civ 5.       Maybe my expectations were too high?     Edit:  I'm don't mean to say the game is bad, it's not, it's a good game with some average parts (like the tedious trade if you have more than 3-4 cities, the quests that don't feel that rewarding or the not that differentiated factions and their lackluster backstory). My main issue is with the price. If this game was <30 euro then I would have recommended it, but as is, like I've said above, wait for a sale.           The combat is exactly the same as in Civ 5, diplomacy is the same, trade is the same, aliens are basically stronger barbarians, city building and unit construction is the same, the only additions are affinities, satellites, non-linear tech tree and quests. Also the game uses the same engine Civ 5 had, there's not much of an improvement visually, which of course isn't something that's really key for a game like Civ, but it's something to take note of.             If you're a Civ fan, of course you're going to like the game, in fact it's going to be addictive. But if you were expecting a different game, something that's not just a Civ 5 with small modifications, then you're going to be a little disappointed, like me.			",570,150,12,63,93,3,103

												Pre purchased, like I had with CIv 5 and X-com, but I don't think I'll pre-puchase another Firaxis game after this. Not awful, just boring and slow with no real direction for the player to follow.It's just a reskin of Civ 5 with no real new gameplay at all and nothing to do with Alpha Centauri. Vague and difficult to understand due to odd and poorly explained goals and a tech web that follows no real structure. Only worth it if you've not played Civ 5 or Alpha Centauri as otherwise you'll be let down by what a sideways step this represents for Firaxis games. I'd expect this kind of low effort expandalone sequel from the Call of Duty franchise, not from Sid Meier's team.Expansions may return the series to a more solid footing but at this price it's simply not worth it for a game that turns into a boring button pressing exercise for the last 200 hundred turns.

												Having played a game of this over the free weekend I have to say that while it is good and fun I agree with everyone else that this is a lot like Vanilla Civ 5 was, wait until the expansion packs to come out because its still really lacking. There's a lot of potential in this game that could be fulfilled in expansions and there's already some nice improvements over Civ 5 (Big one being that the AI doesn't instantly hate you for the littlest thing and positive relationships are easier to maintain) so its definitely worth keeping an eye on. I will most likely pick this game up when the first expansion comes out (Or gets really cheap) and I will also probably change this review, but for right now I would only recommend to play this game during the free weekend.

Beyond Earth (BE) doesn't feel like a Civ game. Sure it has many similar features & mechanics, and you'll know most of the basics from the first turn, but numerous other changes just don't sit well with me, feeling unbalanced & unintuitive. For many Civ fans, winning their space victory and seeing their rocket set off for the stars always left you wanting to continue the journey, one day. There was Alpha Centuri off course, but BE is not AC. BE is set about 500 years into the future, a dying Earth, the remaining civilizations (conglomerates of existing nations) reach out to the stars in hope of survival.   One of the first issues you will encounter is the new tech-web. Not necessarily a bad concept, when there is some logic behind the progression. In Civ, this is natural, as a player you understand the significance of your technological advances (its intuitive, part of our collective human history). In BE where there is no basis, no lore, no previous history created to help the player understand where you are starting from at turn one. Most of the sayings, names, wonders or civilizations for that matter hold little meaning or interest.Technologies for the most do not seem to have any logical steps once you step out the inner circle (few that are familiar like Computing, Chemistry etc.) of the tech-web. It's symmetrical, not organic and although you appear to have so many more paths to potentially explore, in practice I found I just wanted to get the affinity ones primarily as fast as possible to get various bonuses/buildings but most importantly military upgrades. Tech-web is bland & overall is very hard to follow. You will revert to always using filters to make any sense of it all.Military Units now upgrade rather than becoming superseded. I really like this idea, although I don't like the implementation. Your upgrades are seemingly tied to your affinities, along with requiring certain techs to build some units. These steps up in strength can make a huge difference and when all your units instantly upgrade. You can have a war turn instantly on you! It’s a flaw (or perhaps a limitation); these steps should be more gradual. In Civ, this happens as you cycle through and upgrade new units into your military over many various iterations. In BE, there might be 4-5 main iterations over a game per unit type. This can represent significant stats improvement to receive automatically which seems to widen later in the game. Unit upgrades should be far greater in frequency considering the limited number of unit types and should involve other techs, not affinity related too (maybe more minor improvements but still help players keep pace if exploring other parts of the tech-web). Going a smaller arsenal also should have a high level of customisation than simply choosing the affinity. Affinity is also tied to your victory conditions adding further to its importance.I did like the aesthetics & more intense colours used in the alien landscapes and thought the musical score was excellent (so was the intro video!). UI was good in places (liked the colours again), but confusing in others. It seems BE is almost a stats free Civ & other management features seems very cut back to almost non-existent. This simply adds to the confusion when you cannot assess how you are tracking. All feels a bit dumbed down really, even further than Civ V. Feeling less strategy, more plain luck at times. Please bring back the stats!BE is also cut back in other respects, such as no more intros for leaders, no more wonder videos or cool narrators. Diplomacy, is none improved from Civ V and the generic leaders have no personality. Doesn’t really matter much of the time anyways as games mainly turn to war (seems after 500 years nothing’s changed :lol:). One little hex of Miasma clearing can turn your friendly neighbour to the brink of war. AI flip-flop consistently and there is little you can do to avoid it, making it a better approach just to avoid them all together where you can or go strong and wipe them out.Aliens on the planet are an improvement over barbarians, but still not terribly intelligent (or aggressive). Worms are cool!Although the health (happiness from Civ) is less penalising if you go in the negative, I have found it harder to keep in the green. Depending on your tech choices you can find yourself very limited in improvements to counter expansion. I would have liked to see both health and happiness included as different measures, and more flexibility to manage your cities. There are more improvement options for your workers which is nice, but being the future, I would have liked to see options to better evolve your landscape.Satellites (Orbital Layer) are another addition to BE. This could have been a really awesome feature improvement. In practice, I found myself using it very little, as often you had limited choices in launches, and they don't seem to stay in orbit very long for the turns used to build. I would have loved to seen this fleshed out further, options for upgrading satellites to make permanent or increase coverage. Using Miasma killing satellite can send you to insta-war too, so I found myself avoiding using it. Another annoying feature in the late game is having to keep setting your trade routes every few turns. You have so many to manage too it becomes incredibly frustrating!BE has bravely tried to be something unique, introducing some new mechanics to the well-established Civ world. Some of it is interesting enough to experience a few times, but overall this world feels generic, unbalanced & frankly uninteresting. Too much of what makes Civ addictive is lost in BE and I come away feeling a bit dirty about it all, especially knowing the premium price charged (should add overcharged for us Australians at approx. ~$80USD) for what is at most an expansion in terms of real content. For me, this is the biggest disappointment of the year, but Firaxis are known for good after release support, so I am desperately hoping some balance patches and more content might make this more enjoyable. As a big Civ fan I will keep my eye on future progress, but at this stage, in its current state, I don't see it holding my interest for many more turns.If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!

												What I liked:1. Space Env.2. Aliens (Better Barborians=)?/ Barbarians 2.0)3. Selecting your Perks* (Quest/Setting up the game)What I didn't like:1. Affinity = Idealogy (In the nutshell Civ V mech)2. Unbalanced Spy/Tech System3. Trade system and Stations ([Trade system same as Civ V], Stations are dumb down version of City states)4. Where is Religion Beliefs? Only 8 civs. Also no Pollution effects from Civ 1-3. No dynamic environment change...5. Computers are very passive, I mean by 350 turn NOBODY is attacking me (or anybody else!)Overall, Civ BE lacks a lot of key features from Civ V. I was expecting Civ BE being something of Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri an upgrade from Civ II or in this case an upgrade from Civ 5, but it didn't live up to my expectations. It reminds me of Civ V vanilla, a solid game with a lot of cool mechanics, but i think this time Civ Be has less of new/fresh ideas than Civ V vanilla which is very disappointing. It is sad that fraxis wants to profit on multiple 30$ expansions making this game over 100$ in the end if bought at initial release. In my honest opinion, I DO NOT recommend buying this game right now and i suggest waiting for future updates or expansion packs and after buy it as a whole 60$~ or so package to get the most out of yout money... Unless you just crave that vanilla feelz!As for this point my score for this game is 6/10. ",173,29,2,19,12,0,20

												I loved Civilization V. I had hoped this would be Civilization V in space. And... it sort of is. It is a cut down, largely simplified Civilization V. It is deeper in a few areas, but much shallower in most. And in particular, thee is NO reason to play it more than three times, if that. The different paths do not play hugely different, and once you play all three, there is nothing new to keep you coming back. Needed more depth and gameplay variety to keep you coming back. This should have been just a Civ 5 expansion pack.			",26,11,0,33,3,1,15

												I recommend do not buy.Game does not have a lot of replay value.  I beat it on the hardest difficulty on my 3rd play-thru.  (Can see my achv for proof)  The win came, not from amazing player skill, but from awful AI.  That pretty much sums up the game.Awful AI.The AI makes stupid (or insane) choices throughout the game.  It's a leech.  When it's asking for help, it's only trying to slow you down, or rope you into a conflict.  When they declare war on each other it's most often ineffective.  They send a few piddly units at each other that end up dying in miasma.  Mostly war only serves to mess up your economy.  They can expand so many more cities than the player, due to negative Health not affecting them.Negotiations go pretty much like Civ5.  If the AI 'likes' you, then you'll get a better deal.  The worse deals they offer, the closer to war you are.  The AI doesn't understand how to use the tech tree very well.  Often you can tech to certain upgrades, Harmony, etc, and just power curve crush everyone.  Sometimes the AI will randomly bumble into a crushing upgrade, and maybe will knock you around a bit, but don't worry just build a lot of miasma, and it'll die trying to get to your cities.  Or permanently ""Fortify until healed"" off in some forest somewhere.There's nothing glaringly wrong that I've found.  No soul crushing bugs to stop me from enjoying.  The game does that for itself.  It's bland.  Easily manipulated.  Most importantly LACKING REPLAY VALUE.No replay value.Even if they DLC in some extra systems, the core game is still going to be soulless and boring.

												Disappointing.I was preloading this game before it's actual release and thinking about how much I enjoyed the last two installments of Civilization.  Hell I even enjoyed the port to the ps3 to a certain extent (though it wasn't as enjoyable nor did it offer as many roles for gameplay as the pc versions).Civilization V in the future? Sounds like a great concept.  This game was exciting to start up but about an hour into the gameplay, I was bored to death.With having to re-set trade routes every 20 turns ( times the amount of cargo ships or land trade routes you have.. mine was 3x 5... so I had to re-set a trade route pretty much every turn).Endless sea creatures... I mean hell, they're not intelligent at all nor offer much resistance unless you're literally one space away from them. There's not even a nest to rid out, they just randomly spawn the entirety of the game... out of nowhere.Diplomacy was a bore, I had one ally and three enemies, that never stepped foot on my soil for 350 turns (games end).  I had to go seek them out for the war they started.I could continue on but quite honestly, I haven't played this game much past the first two days of owning it.If I could get my money back, I would gladly accept that trade.

												I feel ripped off. I was so excited, but eventually let down. This game is Civ5 with an alien planet skin. I thought there would be multiple types of planets with different resources, but no. It's all the same basic map variations from Civ5, broken up into three basic types and land size areas. I expected more ART. Building a wonder no longer shows a brilliant art piece, instead it shows a dinky gray-scale model. The fun, intrigue, inspiration, and excitement is gone. Not worth 50$ at all. Once again just like Civ5 the multi-player is even worse, non-stop crashing, and people getting booted from the game. And all this boils down to, a poorly made mod, for a five year old title. A step down from what the next Civ title should have been. Big Big BIG Disappointment. And I LOVE Sci-Fi. 4/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alpha Centauri was released in 1999, and in 2014, 15 years later, Beyond Earth is still not as good as Alpha Centauri was. Alpha Centauri created a sci-fi world through its leaders, tech trees, wonders, and short cinematics. Beyond Earth has none of that, with bland, interchangeable leaders, a tech tree that gives no real sense of direction, and fewer gameplay features than a game released in 1999 had.If you want a better version with this exact gameplay, you can just go play Civilization V. It fixes most of the issues I have with Beyond Earth.Alpha Centauri was also a better game than Beyond Earth. You should buy Alpha Centauri for $6 instead of paying $40 for Beyond Earth.

												Imagine someone took Civ5, disassembled it and put all parts of it into a pot with some bits of Endless Space, then mixed it up and gave the result a reskin.That's what Civ BE feels like; Civ 5 all over, except different enough that you have to relearn how to play the game, but not different enough that it is a new, interesting game.And at the end, it just isn't fun.

												Gonna have to say no on this one really. It's not a terrible game by itself, but it's just a reskinned Civs5 that took 1 step forward and 2 steps backward. It added a few little nice things like the tech web, removed things they shouldn't have, and created a really basic system that doesn't have much depth like Civs5 did because apparently the game was too confusing to play(?).-Military Unit promotions are dull, bland, and quite boring. The way affinity works with upgrading them looks cool at 1st because the units look different depending on the affinity path you choose. But it's just a simplified unit promotion from Civs5. You only get 2 options when the upgrade comes up. Where's all the dozen other promotions I could give my unit? Where'd that go? Why is it that a particular unit is always going to have the same promotions when built? I liked it when I could have multiple rifleman with different roles. One played the medic, one had huge defense, and maybe one had really good offense. You can't do that anymore. Every unit of that type now plays 1 single role. *KILLS* it for me.-There's almost no unit diversity. For example, there's only 2 different naval units in the entire game. Really? ...Really?  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯-Wonders are kinda meh. Not as many at all compared to V and most of them don't do much.-The endgame is boring. No real units to look forward to, nothing changes. Plays like it does early game for the most part. Your turns also start to become unnecessarily tedious due to a few annoying things that I hope they do fix. One, being the trade routes. In this game you can get about 3 trades routes PER city you own. So once you start running a dozen cities or more, most of your turns you're going to be constantly reconfirming what that damn vessel/convoy should be doing. Again, and again, and again~-The ""Civilizations"" or Sponsors I believe they call them are♥♥♥♥♥♥ They barely have any unique bonuses, no special units or buildings, and there's only 8 of them to play.So OVERALL: Skip this and go buy & play CivsV if you haven't. It's cheaper and you get more content. Win win!			",152,13,0,28,2,1,7

												I find myself sitting down wanting to play a game of Civ: BE, but deciding not to because I think it'll play out exactly the same way as my last few games: a bland time countdown victory quest and a little ""you won!"" popup. Frankly, Civ BE's endgames are boring to play, and further undermined by not being very interesting in general.It pains me to say this because overall, Civ: BE is so damn cool. It has the seeds of everything I and others have ever wanted from a contemporary Sci-Fi Civ. The super powerful abilities/upgrades/buildings, the intriguing aliens and resources, and general feeling of optimism and discovery makes for a super appealing game environment. While promising, the game we have today is disappointing, with poor replay value. It's fun to play and look at, yet deeply unrewarding.Most of the flaws in the actual game have been well described by other reviews -- the mechanics that have been added to (what is more or less) Civ V are at best shallow, and at worst broken and cheesy. Affinities are undifferentiated score-based research paths rather than defining philosophical differences. Trade is *extremely* overpowered but amounts to boring micromanagement. Quests are repetitive interruptions that don't vary much per game, and the storytelling is rather bland. The orbital layer seems very cool, but after playing with it a while, it tends to just amount to another repetitive micro situation, combined with the fact that it's annoyingly difficult to shoot down other satelites (which creates the incentive for everyone to spam cheap sats -- you'll never be able to actually fit in that planet carver usefully). Add in the standard Civ V issues (abuseable AI, weird diplomacy) and even the wins feel kind of hollow.I did have some fun ""un-terraforming"" the planet as Harmony affinity for a while (since the miasma becomes a buff rather than a penalty), but the orbital layer is cumbersome and the AIs didn't do anything intelligent about it.Overall, the biggest flaw IMHO is that the endgame is dominated by research / planetary wonder quests, and there is very little I've been able to do to stop one of the 5 other players from completing these if they're decently underway. Because of this, you have to rush the science win every time (and sometimes due to random chance you'll get a really unbalanced early quest win off the bat) and then build your military.  My typical game ending is a time-countdown win with little interaction with half the civs, or a loss on the other side of the planet that I can't do anything about. It makes the whole thing feel rather inconsequential.Perhaps in 6 months this game will live up to the promise it deserved, but for now, I wish I had my hours and excitement back.

												I wish I could like beyond earth, I really do. it's conceptually ambitious, attempting to stray into territory uncharted by the civilization series and the realm of gaming as a whole. but the game's many attempts at moral depth and player freedom -- the tech web, affinities, virtues, veterancy -- leave the player stranded in a kiddie pool of directionless monotony.I hate to say it, but the game's touted tech web is chiefly to blame here. with such an overwhelming number of options and routes, the player is easily put off by the mental investment required to navigate it. if you're not interested in reading through each and every technology (most of which unlock units and features totally foreign, meaningless and inaccessible to civ players and normal people) then the tech web becomes more of a tech dartboard. that might be okay if each route actually offered a unique path to victory, but it seems that all roads lead back to the same place: a well-balanced if not numbingly dull civilization. the sprawling tech web, an attempt at ~flavor~ and ~customization~ and a ~unique experience~, though perhaps necessary to depict a technological realm yet unreached by human civilization, ultimately defeats itself because the game must be balanced. the tech web, thus, lies at the heart of a web of shortcomings that ails beyond earth.what made civilization 5 a nuanced and enormously replayable gem was its gimmicky (yet flexible) playstyles -- hoard wonders as egypt, sack ancient-era cities as the huns, city-sprawl as rome, settle one city and amass trade routes as venice -- and it is perhaps most succinctly through beyond earth's abandonment of historical ties that it fails to stay fresh. the game offers just eight factions, each with an uninventive unique bonus and nothing else -- no unique units, buildings, or improvements. gone are the days of keshiks and kasbahs, and in their place is... generic fluff. leaders and their civilizations are devoid of the personality that made them so loveable, hateable, and human in the civilization series. gone is the fun of the game.even that offense might be forgivable if the game offered unique victory conditions, but each one (save for the obvious domination victory) is merely an adventure in bland passivity only negligibly different from the last. firaxis attempts to distinguish these conditions (as well as the three affinities and most choices throughout the game) by creating a moral quandary, but when it all boils down to a yield-per-turn or some other predictable bonus, even the manufactured moral stress goes by the wayside. inevitably you're left fiddling around at the end of the game, waiting for some arbitrary turn condition or building phase to pass, picking buildings at random in still-developing cities, clicking through asinine messages from the AI as each turn grows longer and longer to process. it's what occasionally plagued civ 5's endgame, except somehow infinitely worse, because the entire game up to that point feels like a meaningless slog through a dark, dull, dreary hellscape with nothing to keep you company but a litany of useless, stupidly-named resources and a handful of practically identical (but still somehow gratingly chatty) competitors....but, honestly, I'm not bitter, because it was worth a try.of course, it isn't totally fair to compare the futuristic beyond earth to the clubs and muskets of its predecessors as if they were on equal footing. but the former clearly intends to accomplish the same things: there are still leaderheads and national identities and culture and conflict and conquest. it tries to drag a game about the development of human civilization -- a game that thrives by creating a petri dish of existing history, culture, and warfare -- into a context that inherently destroys the foundations of the game. it's from there that I can draw my most definitive conclusion: beyond earth should not have been a civ game. the alien setting neuters the series' bread-and-butter. beyond earth needed to be its own game, unshackled by the conventions of its predecessors, with its own mechanics and its own identity. as-is, it plays and feels like a low-end mod of civ 5's genuinely dreadful vanilla release, except even more repetitive and unengaging. the idea should absolutely be pursued further -- just not as a civilization game.MISCELLANEOUS PRAISE:+decent soundtrack+customization options in setup (colonists, spacecraft, cargo) make the opening turns a little more varied+player freedom, even if it's all kind of an illusion and leads to the same result+multi-step victory conditionsMISCELLANEOUS GRIPES:-game environment is prohibitively dark. terrain types are largely indistinguishable even after significant playtime, and in that respect alone the game is difficult to enjoy-the user interface is plainly awful. it will slow you down tremendously. that aside, it also looks like trash. it's dull (thank god we have since put away helvetica) and faction colors (in the most avoidable issue of all time) create an illegible mess-the minimap is basically useless-it's buggy as all hell (I have yet to get animated/voiced leader screens to work)-specialists must be manually assigned, even if you use production/science/etc. focus (and you won't notice until it's too late)-health totally prohibits growth and expansion early on and spills over after ~200 turns or so-lacks the personality of a civ game ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												UPDATE 12/12/15 Rising TideThe DLC made me sad.  Real sad.  Base game is alright, though.  Updated 12/12/15The new expansion did not meet expectations.  6/10 cannot recommend.  Go play Civ 5.  Rising Tide made me feel as if they don't want me to play this game anymore.  This is an old review based on the base game, so I'll keep it relevant to that but I warn you:  if you enjoy playing 4x strategy games, stay away from this one.  It's not headed in a reletively good direction.  Take this review with a gigantic grain of salt.  Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth is a game seemingly intended for veterans of the 4x strategy genre and not Civ fans  directly .  I believe this ultimately hurt the game, but it does not detract from the gameplay if you are prepared for it.  The game does differ in a lot ways to Civ 5 in many ways and has many different mechanics in terms of how to allocate your time and resources, but it is also similar in some aspects.  When I first began playing this game as a sort of newbie to the series starting from Civ 5, I did not find this game very engaging and I felt like the game was lacking in a lot of ways that made Civ 5 such an outstanding title (if you include dlc).  It was not until I had played and understood a more complicated 4x strategy that I began to play more about this game (specifically Endless Space).  Now that I do understand more about this game, I'll attempt to explain some of the more basic elements. Mechanics Affinities:Affinities are basically the freedom/order/autocracy of this game, just much, much more important.  Affinities are what define your civilization.  There are three kinds: Harmony, Supremacy, and Purity.  Affinities affect how other civilzations react to you and what sort of victories you can achieve.  Delving deep into an affinity is necessary to win certain victories and is beneficial towards your military, as units grow in power as your affinity strengthens.  The more you develop into an affinity, the more your civ becomes like that affinity.  Your actions quickly become louder than your words as you and the other civilizations advance into their affinities and you will find friends and foes alike based on nothing but your ideology.  Science:Probably the most important thing in the entire game next to affinities.  The science web (yes that's web, not tree) comes in two parts: branches and leaves.  Branches are the basic parts to a technology that allow you move further into the web by researching them.  Leaves allow you to speciallize in a tree. Unlike branches, you can't progress further into the web by reasearching leaves. Leaves, however, often offer better benefits than the more generalized branches do.  Unlike Civ 5 where the science tree is linear and you must keep up research in order to progress as a civilization, you can pick and chose exactly what technology will help you the best for what you are trying to do.  As a new player to this game and games like this, that's a lot of choices to pick from and it can get confusing at times.  It's important to understand what victories there are, what victory you want to pursue, and decide on researching technologies based on what victory you want. Virtues: Like previous Civ games, culture is also an important aspect of the game.  Culture allows you to obtain virtues which provide boosts to your civilization.  There are 4 virtue trees: might, prosperity, knowledge and industry.  Delving deep into a tree will boost combat, food, production, energy (money), science, culture or health based on which trees you chose.  Once again, this game provides with the choice of what virtues you want to pick, and how you want to allocate them.  If you chose to speciallize in a tree, you will get unique benefits the more you put into that tree.  If you chose to go into multiple trees, you get unique benefits generalizing into the same level in each tree.  Spying:Spies provide nice, one-time bonuses you your civilization ever so-often.  Spies can establish spy networks, siphon money, steal science or even call giant siege worms to wreak havoc on another civilization's city.  Spies, although not vital, are very helpful to your civlization's goals. Aliens:You can make aliens friend or foe - it's entirely your choice.  The harmony affinity allows you to be at peace with the alien life on the planet and even use them against your foes.  Supremacy and Purity, however, could care less about the aliens.  If you don't wish to make the aliens friends, they quickly become nuissances that must be dealt with from time to time.  Keep in mind, though, that attacking the local wildlife can put you at odds with other civilizations bent on protecting and preserving the alien life.  Miasma:Some of the most annoying stuff in the game.  Miasma covers certain land tiles on the map and it slowly deals damage to units that end their turn on it.  You can get rid of the miasma by researching the right technologies and using workers or satellites, or use the miasma to your advantage by delving into the harmony affinity allowing them to instead heal your units for the same amount every time a unit ends their turn on it.   Conclusion: The only reason I could recommend this game before was because I thought the DLC would fix some of the issues I had with it.  Now that I am thoroughly disappointed, I can say this game is not something I will be enjoying for awhile.   TL;DR Game is okay. Put time in and you might like it... or hate it.  Probably hate it.On the surface, kinda boring/lacking potential.Rising Tide is garbage.  Reminds me of a one world Endless Space.The DLC made me hate this game.			",102,22,5,9,15,0,15

												Have you ever been playing Civ 5 and thought to yourself ""this games good and everything but I really wish there were less factions, but with made-up futuristic names so I struggle to tell them apart” then this is the mod for you! Did I say mod? I meant £30 full retail game that doesn’t fix any of the issues Civ 5 had. It still suffers from slowdown in late game despite having less factions, the NPC’s still offer utterly insane trades and still throw down whenever they feel like it but all gang up and accuse you of being a murdering despot when you strike first. The end game is still plodding and monotonous and all the AI factions act exactly the same ei: build as many cities as possible as close to you as possible and then declare war no matter what you've done to them in the past.To be fair there are some new features, the rampaging Dune inspired worm is quite nice, until it decides to just move back and forth between two tiles next to your city so you have to spend turn after turn pecking away at it before you can even leave home.Also I love how the other civilizations chew me out for attacking the aliens that are harassing my trade routes, random enemy spawners are people too after all! This might have made sense in Civ 5 where you could make the claim your oppressing a local tribe or whatever, but here you are clearly under siegie by mega cockroaches that have eaten all your workers and the other hippy Civ's are telling you to coexist or they'll come over there and murder you.I just don’t understand how Firaxis can release the same game twice and not fix any of the key problems with it. Why, when I’m being asked to join a war with another faction, can I not check out who it is they are asking me to fight? I can’t remember which faction their stupid space name represents and even if I could surely I’d want to look at their territory and size it up first right? If you've never played Civ 5, and its on sale, you might enjoy this game, after all it is Civ 5 in space and Civ 5 despite its flaws is fairly addicting. If your looking at Beyond Earth because you want a new experience or because you want some of the problems of Civ 5 fixed then save your money.			",139,17,1,22,16,3,24

												For anyone that says that this is a new and exciting game compared to Civ V... you are crazy.  This is EXACTLY like Civ V but just with a out of earth experience.  The same bugs are included, only text when you win, and no story line.  I have seen a couple reviews saying that it has an awesome story line... you are on crack.  Being a civilization fighting for human survival on alien planets.  That is a good beginning to a story, but there is no middle or end to it.  I do like the review that stated that they took Civ V, took it apart, mixed things up, and then threw something back together in a new view.  Everything else is the same.  I wish I would not have wasted my money on this and just played more of Civ 5.  Way to go Sid, you made another game not even close to you previous and made money off the name. Now your name is crap to me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A late review and why I think you should buy CIV: BE on a sale.Going to be short, but this version of Civilization requires you to know wtf are you doing, you can't casually walk on a tech tree like in Civ V, you can't let your scout autoexplore, you can't mindlessly ignore the quest system, you can't, you can't, you can't. The tech web makes it so you have options, but knowing your endgoal is a must in this game so you don't get lost in said web, like I did starting out. ""I guess I'll research genetics, my advisor suggests so"" - No, this is wrong, - ""I am researching genetics because else I am getting into negative health within 30 turns"" - this is the approach.Cultural synergy makes you plan ahead, once again, because if you don't take it into account - you play suboptimally and lose.Quests, Diplomatic capital( abilities and agreements ), orbital management - Civ BE has a lot of systems, many may think more than needed, but when I realised how everything works together, the game started shining for me. I really enjoy the excessive amount of things I need to keep in mind when playing, to play optimally. This feeling when everything you do is done with a far going plan in mind, when everything works, when you adapt your strategy on the fly and everything still goes according to the plan - that is why I launch Civilization BE every once in a while.

												I had high hopes for this game. It has a great many interesting features. However, in comparison with its predecessors it is severely lacking as a single-player game. The diplomacy could be described as experimental but in-game it comes across as grotesque and silly. Your AI opponents may complement you and praise you on your military and on the number of units (of theirs or anyone elses) you have killed, even in the middle of a war. The AI frequently just gives up and surrenders cities, lots of cities. Many quests are broken or nonsensical and placed poorly in the developmental timeline of the game. The poor follow-up on this game is the reason I have not purchased Civilization 6. I have low expectations of Firaxis, and they have shown no signs of correcting these expectations. Firaxis Thumbs Down.			",1,4,0,5,1,0,8

												Where to begin? If you look at my profile you will see at time of writing I am closing in on 1000 hours played of Civ 5. I bought BE on a whim as I got just a little bored of it's ""big brother"". I am writing this just as I near the end of my first game of BE. A game I will likely never finish. I knew in advance this game had mixed reviews and disappointed many. I assumed it was simply due to how polished Civ 5 was. It isn't. This is simply a bad game. Rather than go on expendiing further major effort writing about a game I greatly dislike, I am just going to list a set of bullet point reasons why I didn't like it. I urge the reader to avoid this game. If you are tempted, buy Civ 5 instead as it is FAR superior and should be obtainable much cheaper to boot.1. Miasma. Clouds of poison gas that appear at random all over the map. Units lose 10% HP if they end their turn on it. On average about 1 tile in 3 has it. It adds nothing to the game but frustration and limited unit movement.2. Personality free leaders. I could not work out who was where or who was denouncing who. They are all faceless. Same goes for the Wonders. Boring. Irrelevant.3. Bland happiness mechanic. It's called health but it's happiness really. Since luxury resource no longer exist, there is no trading with others. You just build the happiness buildings you need to keep yourself in the green. Also there is simply no point in trading with other leaders or keeping them sweet as they basically have nothing you want or need. Don't think I opened the Trading screen once.4. Too many featureless resources. I could not remember what did what or what was important. It's easy to understand Wheat / Iron / Oil in Civ 5 but Firaxite / Tubers / Float stone? Doesn't work.5. Poor rendering of the map. The oceans are too dark, making them look unexplored when they are explored. The goddam Miasma is really hard to see.6. The tech web. I hated it. It's just too arbitary and few of its entries actually mean anything. And this is coming from someone who really embraced the Skill Tree in Path of Exile! There are far too many buildings to build and many of them seem very very similar in function. They lack personality, just like the leaders and the resources and the Wonders, making it hard to care about them or remember them.You know what, I had about 10 other things to list but I've lost interest.3/10 - Avoid			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I never thought I'd say this about a Sid Meier game... but I want my money back.Not that Beyond Earth is terrible.  It's that it's BORING.A big part of that is the utter failure to introduce or substantially differentiate any of the factions beyond their in-game stat packages.  It's like if you were a baseball-card collector, and Topps decided to put out a series where every player stares lifelessly into the camera for a mug shot.  But hey, since all the effort went into doubling the amount of stats you get on the back of the card, that's what you really WANT, right?Beyond Earth adds some extra complexity, sure.  You'll quickly find that the Tech Web is something of a headache to navigate, for one thing.  The flavor text becomes meaningless as you irritatedly ignore it in favor of scanning through stats, stats and more stats to try and figure out the best path for your strategy.  Which you won't likely be able to formulate on your first play-through, as there are umpteen different routes to take and few of them are particularly intuitive.So on my fourth play-through, when I finally felt like I had enough of an idea of what I was doing to complete a full game,  I'm cooking along and all seems to be well and I've won the two wars someone else picked with me and I'm managing cities and SORRY YOU LOSE.Wait, what?  Yep, there's a screen pop-up saying someone else won.  Doesn't say who, or how.  The game is just over.  I am, of course, invited to play ""one... more... turn"", but what's the point?  No fanfare, no cutscene, not even the zoom-out to show my ruined civilization that Civ 5 has?Nope.  Not a sausage.All in all, the game mechanics are --- not bad.  I'm used to playing much more complex stuff, like Hearts of Iron.  You can fumble your way into figuring pretty much everything out.  But make no mistake, it IS fumbling about and the Civilopedia isn't much help.  Worse, the atmosphere of the game is BLAND, with even the aliens coming in a limited variety of flavors  but nonetheless seeming to have more characterization and motive than the human factions.Since I CAN'T get a refund on Steam (that I know of), I can only hope the modding community saves this game with a healthy dose of creativity.

												It's not a bad game it's just very bare bones. It's like looking myself in the mirror because you can just see the bones, the veins, the everything quite easily. I cannot recommend this for it's current price because the only real difference... actually I don't think there is a real big difference, actually yeah the tech web is a substantial change to the game just not big enough. Culture isn't nearly as useful as it used to be because, the lack of a culture victory, and the benefits from the trees you go down in the culture menu don't cause much change in tactics unless you go down basically the growth tree which will keep you aflout on your health. Also something to point out is why allow yourself to become friends with aliens when you ARE going to wipe them out, even when you pic the Harmony tree you will find yourself killing off nests and the AI demonstrates that. The aliens have no real use to them as allies it basically just means they won't attack you but that isn't much of a problem when they are laughably weak. The outposts you trade with in my opinion are just wasted space, the AI is horrid, it's very buggy, and the only thing that I found enjoyable is that I found it fun to play wide instead of tall when I am the kind of player who always plays tall. Expansion feels a lot better then it use to, the units you have in the game are purely badass (especially the Xeno Titan) but some unit's animations are very lacking.EDIT: Also that graphical glitch on the unit upgrade screen that has yet to be fixed is also a pain in♥♥♥♥♥to look at.Seriously it's like watching my guys having sex with a Tank and a boat.EDIT 3/10/2015: Forgot to note the AI had gotten so many times more horrid, it's just disgusting.UPDATE: 69% found this useful, lucky numbers people, lucky numbers.EDIT: Also forgot to mention the load times are so much better in this one, so that is at least something good.

												This is one of those games that you wait for thinking that it's going to be great.  You get it and feel a little let down,  you assume that you'd built up too much expectation for it.  Following a second play you realise yes your first impression was correct but sadly there is no refund button.The only thing I can hope is that they provide a lot of free DLC for this making it a better game.  As it stands I honestly can't be bothered to play it again...This is the last time I will ever buy a game before it has been out for a few months first.			",88,48,2,23,38,0,50

												It's one of those games where you REALLY want to like it. Unfortunately I don't. I tried lying to myself about how amazing this game is but I just find it boring. I still like a little Civ 5 now and then but I don't find any entertainment in this :(. I might try playing a game some other time with a fresh mind.Edit: What kills this game for me is the diplomacy and AI. The AI is poor at best, and Civ 5's mediocre diplomacy is copy and pasted to this game. The affinity system and the tech web were cool ideas I thought, but could use some polishing. Ultimately the only really positive thing about this game is the aliens and graphics.			",48,4,0,9,21,0,18

												Here's the thing that haunts me throughout Beyond Earth... the fog of war. How is it that you made it across the stars but couldn't manage to pack a GPS satellite. Every time I play I sit and curse the fact I don't have basic space tech. This game is a half baked after thought from Sid Meier. Uninteresting, not challenging, and overall not that much fun. Most games I've played rarely make it past 300 turns, gone are the days of 900 turn marathons of Civ V. Beyond Earth seems in a rush to get you out the door. The victory conditions are total obscure and meaningless. In addition its clear Sid Meier made this on a shoe string budget, the tech tree is poorly designed and the tech is not that exciting or engrossing. The diplomacy seems to have been lifted from a game in 1999, it seriously antiquated. Half the game the other civ's just sit around and tell you how much they hate you or try to bum resources. You want forge an alliance, have trying to make that happen. When you do win the game you would think they could spring for a least a quick movie of the human race being uplifted to its next evolution. Nope. You get a picture and some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ saying things like were on to the next step. DUMB. What a waste of time and money.   ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game requires the Rising Tides DLC to be truly worthwhile. It can be fun without it too, but it depends a lot on your expectations and how much you're ready to spend on a game for hours played. The AI/politics play in this Civ titles is very lukewarm compared to the main series, and while the victory conditions are somewhat less varied due to being mostly tied to the affinity system, they are better designed than in any of the main series games in my opinion. Other than that it's basically Civilization V without any of its gameplay perks like interesting and unique leader abilities, or great design of technology and social policy progression. The DLC makes Beyond Earth stand out as a full-fledged Civ spin-off with its own unique diplomacy system, quest system (better than both Civ IV random events or Civ V city-state questing) and innovative naval play. If you already own this game or are able to find it with a great discount, I recommend only playing it when you can find the Rising Tide DLC with slightly reduced price tag. The vanilla Beyond Earth is not worth 40€. tl;dr: Buy Rising Tide if you own this game. Skip if you don't.			",116,13,1,34,5,0,14

												This game, while initially fun, is plagued with a variety of problems that seem to be a staple in modern franchises.What would those lovely troubles to which I am referring be?Well how about common faults from old games being carried over! * I don't see this issue being mentioned a lot, but it always♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off how the camera would sometimes jump to random units when your turn begins, selecting a new unit entirely and potentially messing up your input for that turn. Kind of a minor thing, I know, but it has always bugged me rather greatly.*Another issue I have is the new form of city states. Most seem to get wiped out by the aliens rather quickly, and they have an annoying habit of popping up along the route of feasible expansion paths. I once had two outposts appear in a small area I had planned to settle. Seriously - WHAT!?  *To make matters worse, I've had other games where I've spawned by myself away from other players and had no outposts found themselves near me making my trade routes isolated to production and food alone!But no - let's move onto the real trouble plauging this game. What's the real let down? I'll tell you what.Unobvious or Obscure Victory ConditionsHoly hell this is frustrating. I played a game doing the contact victory path - getting most of my tech just to have it unveiled to me that I need what - Observatories. A building you can only get through having an improved resource of Firaxite near the city. Due to the changes in city founding, I was unable to settle 3 new cities, buy tiles, try to improve the resource and purchase the buildings before someone else beat me.But what the hell - I hadn't been told I would need any of this stuff until the last minute! Firaxite hadn't even been required before then! Why would I need obervatories if I have hyper computers and deep space telescopes already! This isn't fun at all! And it isn't obvious either. Gameplay should be streamlined. I shouldn't have to guess about what does what and conditions for victory shouldn't be so obscure. It ruins immersion beyond being bad design - otherwise the description in this case would say (3 ARE NEEDED TO ACHIEVE VICTORY PATH X) But anyone with a mediocre level of sensibility would see that sort of display and realize it only really reveals the bad design behind an idea.I know it's fun to explore and try new things in terms of designing games and telling stories, but the players shouldn't be left feeling confused and frustrating unless you're making a game that aims to achieve solely that function. In which case I will likely call you an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and probably never play your game.Either way, this game has some fun qualities but it doesn't grasp me as something unique - something that really made me go ""Hmmmmm"" like Civ V and IV. I hate to say it, but I think there are much better outlets for entertainment than this game. I have to give it a 4 or 5 out of 10.*Update*Another problem with the game seems to lie in the questing system.There seems to be this peculiar bug during which I've had objectives come up that simply aren't possible such as asking me to build a petroleum refinery in a city which has no oil located around it for 5 tiles in any direction. This indicates poor testing AND implementation of the questing system.These features should have been tested more rigorously to achieve the effect of actually being fun.			",172,15,3,38,10,1,37

												With wonders that aren't wonderous, lopsided naval combat in favor of the attacker, an underdeveloped satellite layer, inconsistent terrain coloring, excessive impassable terrain, no real distinction between the nationalities, a 'tech web' that ceased to be fun when it was called the 'sphere grid' in FinalFantasyX over a decade ago, and a path to victory almost solely dictated to you by local natural resources, I find this game to be a huge step back from the fun of Civ 5. Early units are extremely underpowered, preventing you from trying to establish early dominance. Trade AI still (20 years later) leaves you scratching your head at times. In addition, the ugly terrain keeps you from being invested in fixing up the countryside and making it feel civilized. The inability to easily select a member of a set of stacked units make some tasks difficult.A few bright spots in this otherwise lackluster offering:- The tweaks to building output via the quest decision path is a nice touch.- The concept of the satellite layer is nice- The entire premise of the game is solid- Rapid expansion of civs (a la Civ 3) fits the game's premise nicely- Due to the tech web, almost every game will play differently- Espionage now has more tangible rewards than it did over the previous Civ games- The ""barbarians"" of the alien world present a real threat early on, which would be expected on an alien world.Overall, I'd say just stick to Civ 5. It's easier on the eyes and more rewarding. I would not recommend this game.			",71,18,1,11,17,3,22

												Definitely not worth the asked price right now. Maybe it will be better with addons but right now the game is rather shallow, bland and imbalanced. - The game factions are bland, they lack any personality at all and all feel the same. This is subjective though, but I don't like the game lore a single bit. I don't understand why they had to go with ""Earth nations"" inspired factions.- The trade route spam is required for victories but is very tedious. The trade UI compared to Civ5 is lacking: your previous route does not get highlighted properly, you cannot sort the trade routes by yield or science or other stats. Your cities have 2 basic trade routes, with Autoplant quest you can get 3 so it a colony with 5-6 outposts you'll be managing 15-18 trade routes and all the time you'll have to scout the unfriendly interface to find the best one. It's very tedious but if you don't do it - you feel punished.- Affinities do not shape your civilization TOO differently, they just unlock new units and give them some bonuses. That's pretty much it.- Diplomacy is pretty much non-existent, the AI is too passive- Aliens are glorified barbarians, they can be dangerous early on when expanding but the building Ultrasonic Fence does not allow them to enter your territory so once you have that done in your city they are even weaker barbarians. Your explorers can get immunity from aliens by going 1 tier into Purity and you can easily snipe their nests with explorers.- There are no religions in the game, no ideologies, no world congress, no golden age periods, no Natural Wonders. Alpha Centauri had them but Civ: BE does not. You do not feel that you're truly shaping a new society on a new planet.- Quests are same pretty much every game. Game designers also call ""Constuct buildings, wait a few turn, pick 1 bonus out of 2 for these buildings"" a quest. It's a missed opportunity.- The wonders in the game are kinda uninteresting. Some of them feel really disappointing like a late game tech wonder that gives you 5 science. And that's it. In Civ5 some wonders were amplifying or enabling certain strategies in certain situations, same was for Alpha Centauri where some wonders were really powerful. In Beyond Earth some wonders are strong, some are weak but in general I feel they are not balanced enough and lack meaningful though.- There is no victory screen. There is no Hall of Fame.- Victory conditions for different affinities do not feel distinctive enough.Some of the things developers did right though IMO:+ The music is great+ Tech web is a great idea but requires a bit of polish and balancing. Right now it's too easy to slingshot to strong techs with some sponsors but in general it's nice+ Espionage system I feel is better than in Civ 5, it's not as tedious and allows for some really fun stuff other than tech stealing or election rigging.+ Social policies (Virtues) can be developed both deep and wide which allows for some interesting gameplay. + Lots of different improvements, Orbital layer for sattelites to give temporary buffs over tiles+ The game has a good feel of actually exploring the planet.I don't agree with the vision developer had for the game. They tried to develop a spiritual successor to Alpha Centauri but they missed the most important aspect of Alpha Centauri: it's a rich sci-fi story told through turn-based strategy. Here they have a turn-based strategy with story being a mere afterthought. Hopefully addons and patches will change that in future. All in all I wouldn't recommend this game right now. It feels rushed and unfinished. It should get more patches, more polish and more DLC. I'd recommend to buy it if you see it with a nice discount and wait for DLC's. Civ 5 eventually got good, maybe this game will too.			",97,17,0,56,20,2,45

												I've heard that Civ:BE is a bit too much like Civilization V. I don't care about that. I only care that it's a fun game, and it is. It has all the things I like about Civilization games... and some of the bad things too. I can build a mighty empire. I can do it peacefully, or battle my opponents. I can coexist with aliens, or wipe them out. I can pick from five different victory conditions to pursue, each with interesting advantages and disadvantages.On the downside, starting positions can still be extremely unfair, just like all the previous Civilization games. I can start one game in a large expanse of prime territory, with no adversaries nearby; and I can start another surrounded by aliens, with my expansion blocked by canyons, mountains, and other factions. This can make for very interesting variety, but it can also be very frustrating. Oh, and diplomacy can be just as annoying as other Civilization games.Overall, the great things about the game offset the bad, at least for my enjoyment. Expansions should make the game even better.

They will learn from their financial reports eventually and maybe we will get a game designed by a designer instead of an accountant or lawyer.  Shame on you 2k.

												This is the first game I've ever reviewed... And while I've only played three games (two offline, one online hence my low hour count), I've played substantially more Civ V. Which is pretty much this game is. Except stripped down. If you played Civ V on initial launch, you'll know what to expect. A stupidly stripped down game, lacking any of the mechanics that make it long lasting/replayable/interesting. I'm giving the game a negative review because we all know what Sid Meier is playing at. The DLC has undoubtedly already been planned which will bring back the content that is missing.In New Zealand, we are charged 90 USD for this piece of **** when in a years time I'll be able to buy the full game with all of its DLC for cheaper. So if you haven't bought the game already, wait to buy the GOTY edition or whatever so that you actually get a proper experience.  ",116,29,1,21,21,1,36

												So much complaint about Civ BE. I love this game. Compare it to Civ V and sure, it falls flat, but when you consider its merits on its own, the game has a lot of strengths.- The tech web allows for extremely creative play styles. You can play the same faction, on the same world type, with the same starting resources and situation, and have *completely* different experiences. - Aliens provide an interesting early-game foil, since you can easily opt for a pacifist stance, go full-on xenophobic and kill every one you see, or somewhere in between. There are benefits and drawbacks to each. - The affinities could use a bit more depth to them, I think, but with the addition of hybrid affinities with Rising Tide they have started moving in the right direction.- The military game in Civ BE is *fantastic*, so much more to it than Civ V's combat. Especially with the hybrid units from Rising Tide, you have a lot more abilities and variation available to you. Units pretty much never go obsolete, since they automatically upgrade when new technologies are developed. It's not a perfect game, but I enjoy it thoroughly and feel it stands up very well on its own alongside other entries in the Civ franchise.			",79,34,0,32,40,0,32

												Had the potential to have all the strengths of Civ V but with a wider canvas. Ended up breaking what worked and made the game muddy and frustrating.The resource system added new and interesting possibilities but had no decisive explanations and felt like you were just rubbing sticks together.Aliens lack reason and appear in numbers way too often. It feels like Firaxis wanted barbarians with character but instead just made wild animals that keep running in front of your headlights. The aliens didn't feel a part of the game unless you wanted to exploit them later. They just acted as speed bumps that deprived you of vision and map control.The Civs or ""Sponsors"" were faceless pupperteers who came in random specifications and meant that you couldn't read your enemy or plan ahead. Decisively making a certain build to a certain Sponsor would have been so much easier but instead you're constantly building Explorer's to find out what they're running. Then half your Explorer's die because you stepped one hex too close to an alien.Game wise a 6/10Character wise a 3/10Still a Civ game just not one that deserved the title.			",103,15,0,10,14,2,18

Posted: May 19, 2016
												There is so much hate out there for this game and i dont think that it deservese that. So i decided to make an own review and try to stay as objective as i can.So is Beyond Earth (BE) as bad as most of the Reviews here are trying to tell you? No!Is it a good startegy game? Sure!Is it as good or as deep as Civ V+Expensions? Hell, no!Should you buy it? Well...That depends on two very big and very improtant""If""s:First of all and most important:  If you like the Setting With the expansions, Civ V offers a way deeper and more diversified experience. If you are not into the SiFi-Setting and like the imagination of a few refugees trying to colonize a new alien planet, there is no reason to buy this game instead of Civ V. There are just so many Gameplay elements missing like Cultures, buildings and units you actualy know, Religions, Unique Units and buildings for every Civ. and so on. While at the other hand there are only a few new elements like:The affinity system: This is mabey the coolest inovation of the whole game: You can become a culture of geneticly modified Treelovers who want to become one with the planet"" (literaly), technophile Cyborgs who want to anihilate the filthy human race, or a group of soldiers which are only a orbital deploy system (which is researchable) away from beeing the ""Space Mariens"" which is almost a violation of Warhammer Copyrights (just kidding).Depending on your research- and questdecissions (which are the biggest influence for progression in the 3 types of affinity), your Units and Cities start to look more and more like those folks and get different stats. Together with the different planetskinis, that also affect the gameplay a little bit, this system gives the game a lot of replayabilty in addition to the already known variety of a campaign which is entirely based on random events.AliensWhich are a silghtly more extensive version of the barbarians from other Civ-games, but dont expect more. They clearly missed an opportunity there.Quests, Decisions and Planet Exploration: First of all, there are a lot of things to explore with your explorers. This gives you especialy in times of peace sth to do appart from building new colonies, building roads, building farms,  building buildings, or my favorite: Building buildings, that increase your production rate, so that you can build other buildings faster - build building-building buildings so to say (I love this language). Additionaly there are some bigger quests unlocked through exploration, research, progress or random events. They are intresting written (not extraordinary good nor bad) and give you a little bit of roleplay. Unfortunatly all the quest work the same way: Do Sth (most of the times constuct a building or research a tech) and then a decission which gives you some bonus out of it. But its still bigger and better than the Citystate-Quests from CIv VAdditionaly, for every new building, there is a small decission-quest which gives you the opportunity to unlock addtional bonuses from them.All of those quests are only written down - there are no videos or even pictures throughout the whole game, which is not only my biggest point of criticism but also the second If:You can only enjoy the game, if you are willing to read through TONS of  (at least in German language version)  very complicated written texts. In Civ-Games, you know exactly what you are doing, when you order f.e. the Pyramids, a Knight, or a City Wall, or research the Wheel. You know these things from your live, documantaries or from history education in school. In BE we are in a SiFi-Setting with tons of buildings, tech, units, resourses and so on you don't know. They have strange names and minimalistic Icons, that tell you absolutly nothing about how they look like, or even what they do at all. Even if you have completet a wonder, you get nothing but a lousy blueprint of that building. Yes that's right no video like in Civ IV or Civ II not even a freaking picture of how this would look like - just a STUPID BLUEPRINT! When you build the Great Wall in Civ 5, you know how it looks like from thousands of pictures and videos - you even might have visited it already in reallife. Whilst in BE you have NO IDEA what youre spending your production on, when  you build the ""Tectonic Anvil"", or the ""Stellar Codex"".This game would have desperatly needed videos, that show you your wonders in action, or at least big 3D-Models of all your Buildings and Wonders (like in Civ 2) in your city screen or at least some FREAKING PICTURES. But there is nothing of that. So you have 2 options: You either say: ""♥♥♥♥ it"" and just build strange icons with strange names only for their stats, then you're not goint to enjoy this game at all - as you just cant identify yourself one bit with your Colonies. This is why many people descripe this game as ""soulless"" even if the developers actualy put a lot of effort into the lore of their universe. The problem is, that the only way to ""find"" the soul of this game, is through the descriptions.So what I recomment you to do is to read the description of EVERY SINGLE unit, every building, every wonder just everything. This is the only way to get an Idea of the lore and the universe you're in and the only way to get attached to the game. So while this is already a lot to ask from the modern gamer, who is used to have at least 5 hours of cutszence in their CoD Story Campaign. it's getting even worse:All the descriptions are written from a retroperspective point of view: All, or at least most of your actions through the game have already happened. It's just written like the events in BE were based on our actual history (just like the other Civ games) and we are some colonists from the year 2400 or sth like that who are replaying their own past. While this might be a cool idea they just took it over the top by putting an overhelming number of scientific special words in their descriptions. It might be conceivable, that those words might be part of general knowledge in 300 years, but for today, you almost need a universty degree in Medicne, Biolgy, and Physics to 100% understand, what they are writing in those texts. Of course u can also get the point of the descriptions without understanding every single word, but if you're not used to a certain pretty high level of scientific parlance, you're going to have struggles to understand those descriptions, even if you are already willing to read them.The decissions of how they try to immerse the player into their game are so poorly made, that i wish the responisble designer to get eaten by angry Xenos! But if you think, that you are fulfilling both ""Ifs"", and are that type of player, that likes to create the biggest part of the story in his imagination and through the gameplay, just like it is needed in games like Skyrim, other Civ games or Total War games, you are going to have a lot of fun with this game. At the moment i enjoy BE more than Civ 5 just because of the Setting and the way the actualy pretty well written and described universe fuels the biggest graphics engine that exists: My imagination.But if you're not a fan of the SiFi-Setting or are not that guy/girl that likes to read him/herself trough tons of text just to get a better immersion, there is no way to recommend this game over Civ V. Mabey you can check it out when it is at 10 Bucks on a Steam Sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Impressive music, beautiful graphics - that is when the graphics work at all and doesn’t flicker, or outright crash your game.Terrible AI (even worse than previous editions of the franchise) AI that issues war declaration attacks and then imediately surrenders and gives you some of their cities as payment, AI that insults you when you are overwhelmingly powerful compared to them, AI that contacts you to moan about your lack of Affinity in a certain affinity, yet you not only have said affinity but youre maxxed out. List is long and horrific. Hilariously overpowered Trade routing, utterly inactive aliens (think of really passive barbarians) that also to top it off does not evolve so late game you = Titan, them = lowest level unit which is also passive.Spying can literally take the capital cities from people and decapitate them outright, you can steal in the tens of thousands of currency even if the AI has 2k at most, in fact this is so broken I ran a game where I solely got income from spying and bought every unit and building outright, who needs production right?No ICBMS in the future, no mass destruction weapons of any kind, no bombers, no subs, and no long range battleships to force players into different reactions, total unification of units. You got a plane the end. A ship the end. ect.Affinities mean nothing as you will get them all anyways even if you don’t want to (they’re tethered into research) so you are forced to be a mix of all anyways and by all I mean the staggering sum of 3. zzzZZzzzMultiplayer is so broken that it cannot be played. While you can sometimes load a game up with friend’s don’t ever save thinking you can load. That mechanic is broken, so you can only launch the game play it and hope to god you finish the game before you would otherwise have to save or you’re boned, also hope you finish before anyone else crashes since you cannot load that would be an automatic restart.The game looks beautiful but it is an illusion. The gameplay is wrecked in its current state and only the most fanatic fan can possibly defend the title in its current shape.Hopefully like Civ 5, this game will dramatically improve when patches and expansions hit but for ponying up a premium for this triple A title is a joke in its current state.Also the ""response"" from developers has left a lot to be desired.

												i havnt played this very much, because i couldnt. i just couldnt bring myself to admit that after 5 good civ games, they finally just gave in and ended it. Perhaps they want to release it, unchanged for the iphone later on. ive never felt betrayed by a computer game before. perhaps im being overly harsh but this ones made me feel a bit emotional.

												The game is just boring.  It lacks personality.  To be fair, I have not purchased RT and I do not plan to, at least not until it's on sale for $5.  I purchased BE at launch, suckered into the hype, and I do not feel like spending another $30 to ""fix"" this game is smart.  I left this game on the shelf for many months and just dusted it off again, same issue.  I'm halfway through a game and I'm just BORED.  No need to continue, DELETE.			",69,39,0,12,3,0,16

												So far I've put in over fifty hours in Beyond Earth, mostly while writing a master's thesis.  I would recommend this game, but with reservations.  BE is alot like CIV 5, in that it started out well but left people who had been overwhelmed by the complexity of CIV 4 confused.  BE is a good base from which to start, but it screams for expansions, in many of the same ways CIV 5 did.  One's navy consists of two boats....sad, but similar to Vanilla CIV 5.  The terrain needs pizzazz, some really weird alien shiznit or vibrant colors to jazz it up.  Also, rather than having the aliens behave pretty much like slightly differentiated barbarians, add something like GRAVEMIND or a massive hive system which plays into the affinity system.  That much being said, I enjoyed the new additions.  The affinities are different, though I feel like they could use a little something extra, perhaps an enhanced sense of exclusiveness.  Most of the reviews on here ignored the new orbital system, which is probably the best innovation in the game.  The auto upgrades were also nice, as they saved tons of shekels and time.  Plus I really like the vast array of new tile upgrades you can set your workers to build, though some appear annoyingly late and few are affinity specific.  So overall, I like and continue to play this game.  However, I REALLY look forward to DLC because it still needs work.  Is it a beta realeased early, an insult to gamers, or Gaddafi in programming form? No.  Is it the most brilliant game ever made? Not Yet.  With a few tweaks, this can really become CIV in Space, an independent game that doesn't feel so similar to the game engine of its predecessor.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I came back to Beyond Earth after a long time away and I wish I hadn't.  Hours of my life I'll never get back.The bottom line is that this game is a total failure of imagination.  It's a simplified conversion of Civ 5, with its systems dumbed down, its graphics homogenized, and its tech tree replaced with a web filled with Star Trek technobabble.Ultimately the simplification of Civ 5 to make Beyond Earth is a very minor concern compared to the elephants in the room.  It plays like its older sibling.  It's systems are slightly modified, some for the better, some for the worse, but ultimately the actual gameplay of Beyond Earth is fine, or at least not worth criticizing.But ugh, the writing and the graphic design.The technobabble is the worst part.  Few of the technologies, buildings, or wonders make any sense.  This is a major problem in a Civ game, because they are what makes a Civ feel like you are accomplishing something and not just mashing buttons and wasting hours upon hours of your life.  Researching Literacy and building Libraries and eventually a Great Library resonates with players.  We all know what that means and what impact it is likely to have on our civilization, and that makes us feel like we're getting somewhere.  But researching Protogenetics or building a Gaian Well leaves you hanging in a very real way.  What does a Tectonic Anvil do?  Why do I want one?  How does it help me?  What does it even look like?  The new web-like tech tree gives players a lot more choice in how they develop their civilization, but the choice feels meaningless because it has no emotional weight.  I'm reminded of the famous debacle over Mass Effect 3: ""Pick a color for your ending.""  There's no green in Beyond Earth, they made it yellow instead.I realize that this might seem like I am picking nits, but I'm not the only person who has noticed this effect.  Read a few other negative reviews, even professional ones, and you'll see the same concerns.  A tech tree full of meaningless jargon really undermines a lot of what makes a Civ game feel satisfying.The technobabble is particualrly unforgivable, in my opinion, because I've always felt like Civ has a mild educational tone.  But some of these things in Beyond Earth have names that players might mistake for real-world science, and they are not only fictional but are active misinterpretations and misrepresentations of important scientific concepts.  All of the science in this game is garbage.  I wouldn't criticize most video games on this point, but I held Civ to a higher standard.  It's like Firaxis made no effort at all to create a believable fiction around this nonsense.  Here are two of my favorite quotes:""However, if we reverse the polarity, it will decrease the ultrasonic circumference, allowing the fence to become mobile...""What?""Bionics are part of the future, this we cannot ignore.  If we ignore it, it will consume us.""WHAT?  Also, serious negative points for grammar and composition, Firaxis....There's a real winner in almost every paragraph.  The game has three graphical tilesets (four with the expansion), which seems like an upgrade from Civ 5's ""boring"" Earth tileset, except that they're actually all the same tileset, just palette-swapped.  What's worse is that the predominant color of the palette is pervasive, like a universal color filter, so it is impossible to tell anything from anything else, whether it is a hill, a desert, tundra, or a flood plain.  Again, the expansion tileset is better about this but they didn't fix the other three.The game's approach to color overall is a disaster.  The alien species that overrun the map have green icons when they're calm and pass through yellow to red as they become more agitated.  Whoever thought this was a good idea needs to go back to interface design school.  What's more, many aliens share the global palette, so they blend right into the scenery.    On a similar note, the game's tech tree is so samey that someone actually wrote a mod that does nothing else but better differentiate the icons in the tree.  This casual disregard for player understanding is everywhere in Beyond Earth.I really wanted to like Beyond Earth, but even after all this time, Civilization: Alpha Centauri is still the superior game.  If you're looking for a more modern experience, also consider Endless Legend.  Civ 5 is perfectly serviceable if you're not married to the sci-fi theme, and Civ 6 is right around the corner.  But Beyond Earth is one to skip, unless you are a truly rabid fan of the genre, and Civ in particular.POSTSCRIPT FOR THE BENEFIT OF MY FELLOW MOLECULAR BIOLOGISTS:""Upon the discovery of retroviruses and reverse transcriptase, research accelerated phenomenally and in short order introns were unlocked, giving scientists the ability to engage in RNA splicing, the first step in the field of protogenetics. In RNA splicing, the introns are removed and exons joined – genetic engineering at its most basic level. Since RNA conveys the genetic information that directs the catalytic biologic reactions at the cellular level, modifying these can dramatically alter the function and/or operation of an organism. While some colonial geneticists focused on the DNA strands in efforts to engineer new species, others sought instead to modify the already existing ones through protogenetic RNA manipulation.""Ugh.  Just... ugh.			",206,80,3,71,24,1,41

												Bit of a let down when compared with Civ 5, lacks many new features and essentially feels like Civ 5 has been stripped down and given a new skin. While the espionage system is improved compared to Civ 5, the game is dull. The civilizations feel bland and boring, the aliens are more of an annoyance rather than an added challenge and generally the game feels boring and lacks replay value.This may be addressed in DLCs and updates, but until more features and civs are added, I wouldn't recommend it.

Dodge this like you would miasma as a purist.Let's start with the good points...Pros:★ The introduction of the quest tree.★ 3 new 'philosophies' to choose from.★ It looks pretty in the trailer and in my games library.Cons:✖ No lastability.✖ Rushed and reskinned civilization game.✖ Promised lots... failed to deliver.✖ Technology tree is terrible.✖ Lacks the feel of acheivement all the way through.✖ Multiplayer is hardly functional.✖ Chooseable civ's leave a lot to be desired.✖ AI is woeful.✖ Discovery of the 'Big Mistake' is buying this game.Firstly I just wanna say, I've been a Sid Meiers Civilization fan since I was in primary school. A fond memory of mine is playing Civ 1 on my lunch and recess breaks while hogging the computers from people who actually wanted to study. I've been a really devoted and loyal follower of the Sid Meiers series for almost as long as I have been alive, annhilating and finishing all Civilization game series and their spin-off's (e.g. Call to power, Alpha Centauri, etc).Civilization Beyond Earth has completely failed to grasp my attention for longer than one playing hour and has me very dissapointed in so many facets of the game. Since buying the game on release, I can't bring myself to play this game anymore because of how unoriginal and terrible the AI and gameplay is. Unfortunately this is even with the added steam workshop content that is 'recommended' after downloading the game, another area requiring work. I've tried my hardest to like this game, but I can't.If you want some really healthy advice, buy Civilization V and download a whole heap of mods from the Civ Fanatics website and don't pay for any upcoming DLC from this game. By assisting this game in sales, you will not be teaching the developing team a lesson. It's also easy to say that you'll suffer the same fate like many others if you make that very risky jump.Shame Shame Shame.			",108,13,2,18,18,1,29

												Firstly, I wish I could give this game a neutral rating. I'm an avid Civ V fan and I did enjoy Civ BE. But BE is overpriced for the amount of game content, and the multiplayer is too unreliable to be counted upon unless gaming with a known premade group of friends. I have given up on even attempting public mutliplayer at this point in time. Basically don't buy this game if single player isn't enough for you.BE offers a refinement on Civ V's mechanics in many ways, the tech tree, automatic Civ-wide instant unit upgrades, and the ""explorer"" mechanic instead of old scouts being three major ones. But other game mechanics just don't exist (yet, I'm sure they will add DLC for them later). Religion, culture wars/tourism, great works, great people, and world congress all do not presently exist in BE and have no replacement mechanics. The number of military units is less than those found in vanilla Civ V as well.The tech web is probably the greatest concept of BE, but I didn't understand why until I actually used it. It allows players to diversify and focus on wonders other players will never even attempt to go for, and it rewards players that focus on one ""branch"" of the web as opposed to Civ V where everyone was researching the same techs and fighting over the same wonders all the time. In BE you can research only the branches of the web you want, and games can end long before all of the tech web has been researched.Unfortunately, the tech web by itself isn't the game. For all the beautiful graphics and (much appreciated) game optimization done, it feels like there is less game content here than there was in the original Civ V at its launch. There's only 8 ""civs"" but most of the original V AI was carried over with all it's idiosyncracies and inability to win without ignoring all the game rules. The AI itself is not as dangerous either, and presently seems to be bugged so that it will only ever use ~20% of its forces at a given time. Any Civ veteran will be capable of beating the highest Apollo difficulty AI in a straight up normal game on any map 1v1 once they understand BE's mechanics.Civ BE is a good game in of itself, but I'd suggest waiting for a steep sale or the inevitable steep discount when major DLC gets released. The single-player AI will make for an unsatisfying challenge for Civ V veterans and the multiplayer will only lead to a hopeless waste of many hours per failed game.			",1311,542,26,115,122,11,170

												It's like Civ 5 without expansions, some really questionable new design decisions, far fewer victory conditions, less character in the civilizations and leaders, and with a really really bad narrator. But the ground's purple so it has that going for it.Avoid it. If you want to play Civilization, play 4 or 5 (With both expansions). If you want a new 4x you'd be far better served by playing Endless Space or Endless Legend.			",1637,738,41,289,202,17,327

												I'm a big fan of them civ games and especially Sid Mieier's ones, and here is what i think of this :It feels like an expansion or mod or DLC to civ 5 but a standalone game? Not really. Because:1)Units have essentially 100% same mechanics as civ 5, melee warriors, archers, horsemen, horse archers, air units, there is nothing different between Beyond Earth units and these2)Cultural perks are step back in comparison to Civ 5 ones, they do not provide any meaningful impact at all on their own or you need a bunch of them to feel any difference3)Graphics is somewhat crude, miasma can be barely seen (xenofungus anyone? hell yea cant miss fungus it even if you want to)4)Overall lack of innovation compared to civ 55)We were promised customisation of units and some meaningful interactions with alients but these are not in the game? I guess someone want to cash in on dlc'sSeriously this is as if Brave New World have never been releaced, this game has less fatures than BNW, less features than 2002 Alpha Centauri!Good things:1)I actually do like tech web 2)Different planets got different colours, awesome!

												Severely watered down and unbalanced Civ 5 mod, by any other name. Sorry. Graphically it's very nice, the textures on the landscapes are stunning. You do however, require a bit more depth from a Civ game.I've put thousands of hours into Civ games, ever since Civ 2. I felt that the hate that Civ 5 experienced was largely unjustified, but this is the worst one so far, it pains me to say.It smacks of lack of testing and content. The spies are so overpowered, you can literally overthrow enemy capitals and thus win a domination victory without firing a shot. Unit types are virtually non-existant - you get 'soldier', 'tank', 'artillery', 'boat', 'plane', with affinity upgrades to differentiate them late-game.It just feels so lightweight, when you look back on the lore and varying factions of the likes of Alpha Centuari. Virtually no faction dialogue, no explanation of techs, no feeling of the hostile environment that you have supposedly landed on. I skip through diplomacy as quickly as possible - there is only so many times you can hear that 'what's ours is yours, for a price'. AI is still bonkers, and will declare war for so much as clearing poison gas from their territory!Haven't been this disappointed in a legendary franchise since C&C4.Civilization: Beyond Nerfed.

												I have played Civ:BE for about 25 hours now. I was on the fence on recommending this game. On the positive side: The game is pretty much bug free, it is ballanced and all the mechanics work. The graphics and sound are nice. And it is pretty straight forward game play.On the negative side: The game is tedious and bit boring. The tech tree is all over the place. The game play seems slow and for some reason terrain almost has this claustrophobic feeling to me. None of the Civ leaders have much personality. The miasma gas really doesn't add anything to the game and is just annoying. The wonders don't have any special meaning .. It is just a static graphic and it is hard to tell what it does for you. The explorer is weak and pathetic. And there are ships .. why do you need boats when you have hovercraft?The mods have made this game better. There are mods that make the tech tree elements clearer and there are mods that improve the graphics of the game. When all is said and done, I am afraid I can't recommend this game. And that saddens me greatly because I really am a fan of the Civ franchise.			",38,10,0,16,26,1,38

												Some people claim this is a re-skin of Civ 5, but it's not. It's worse than that. Almost everything about this game is worse than previous games. The military units have been reduced to a small handful that automatically upgrade as your tech level rises. The tech web is confusing and hard to navigate. Aliens (the new barbarians) cover the entire map and go from being a danger early game to a frusration late game where they are STILL all over the map but pose no real threat. Trade routes are mandatory because of how powerful they are, yet they are implemented in a very annoying way that makes you choose  trade destinations way too often. Health (the new happniess) is badly balanced and from what I've found it's impossible to keep it in the positive numbers if you have more than one city, until late game when your virtue tree bonuses can bring it back up. And playing with just one city in games like this is just not fun. Skip this one, play Civ 4 or 5 instead.			",364,94,24,42,44,4,77

												They cant even fix Civ 5 Multiplayer which has been broken nearly 2 months now. To be honest multiplayer in this game barely works. Do not buy this game until they get this stuff fixed.  I am tired of being a beta tester in games recently. It has pretty much killed gaming for me in general. From halo mulitplayer not working to now this. Dont be a fool and buy any game until you read good reviews. Learned my lesson.Edit: They fixed Civ 5 multiplayer so its playable again but its still quite a pain to get a game to last long enough without having some sort of bug happen.  I really would like them to focus on multiplayer so its not such a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ I still dont recommend this game unless you get it for half price which wont happen till expansions drop.

												If i could i would get my money back, or at least have waited for a sale. Game is very disappointing. Feel like i got excited over a game that had much more to offer but failed to deliver. Read the reviews, there are many pros and cons.Pros-if you're new to civ then yes, it is a great game. Satellites provide a interesting mechanic along with the virtue system. Tech web is interesting but ultimately it is linear. Choosing your starting options is a great touch which will allow for more strategic gameplay. exploring is a little fun since you have to send your explorer back to a city to restock its module to excavate.Cons-Doesnt really matter who you start out with, most starting choices are useless. Aliens are weak and feel too passive. You have unit classes : land melee, ranged, armor, artillery, ship,and plane....as you grow in affinity they upgrade into stronger versions. Makes combat a little boring because you cant really have a diverse army. AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ still. Trade is OP. Most game mechanics are taken from civ5 and i'd honestly rather play it than BE. Overall it is a vanilla civ5 to me. Would have liked to see affinity unit upgrades more diverse like purity gets boosts geared toward offense, supremecy gets slight offensive/defensive, and harmony toward offense or something like that but in the end all units of each tier are the same no matter which way you go...just the skin is different. BE still has a long way to go. I would recommend you wait til the game gets more interesting because right now its really not. Got bored after my 3rd game and i play on massive marathon. played one game on standard speed and it was still boring as hell.			",63,7,0,13,4,0,20

Even if you could run Civ V, the Beyond Earth demo or the game itself when it was released, chances are the game will still not work. Hundreds of people who bought and played the game are now unable to do so. The only response from the 2K, Firaxis support is that their cutomers should buy the $200 ADM graphic card and that those same customers were pretty stupid to believe that if you could run their demo, you could run their game.Fail			",1,0,0,2,0,0,5

												Edit: The expansion is out. I don't like it. All the problems of the base game havent been fixed and therefore cannot recommend. It also managed to be released with bugs and worse balance thant the base game.Edit: Even after 2 patchs the game is still shallow. Patches are very slow to come, some easily fixable issues aren't fixed and the patches have brought their lot of bugs and poorly thought changes.Not recommended.I have played around 80 hours of this game and after playing multiple times on max difficulty (Apollo), I can safely say that I would not recommend the game in its current state. I've finally managed to break my personal record with a turn 145 standard speed victory with Harmony due to the massive amount of oversights the game has.Right now a ton of features are imbalanced or broken which is very problematic in a strategy game. Let's list them here:-Trade routes are either too numerous, too strong or both. The ability to spam cities just to increase trade route that will imediately pay for themselves is fundamentaly broken. Their strength belittle a lot of other mechanics making them the only real strategic purpose.-The mechanic supposed to slow expansion doesn't work and is ineffective (health). The panalities for expanding are laughable in comparison to the benefits. The system to get health is anyway badly designed as this is a global ressource mostly acquired through local bonuses... this makes it very hard to get positive without investing virtues. But at the same time it's very easy to stay positive since you can spam local health until you reach each city threshold.-The main strategy due to those two previous points is to just spam cities and trade routes. But trade route interface is horrible making the only relevant strategy a hassle to play.-The UI is worse that the previous game. For no reason. The scales are wrong, colors are terrible and the iconic way of representing buildings units and technologies is lazy. It's very hard to know at a glance what an icon represents. It's a shame considering the wonderful art design of Civ 5.-The terrain tiles are very hard to distinguish at a glance from one another, especially in fungal maps. You can activate Tile Yields or play with a mod to help for this though.-The 3 affinities were presented as 3 very different objectives but they are basically all a form of a science victory. Just get the required techs, build the wonder, wait and win. Exit, culture victory, diplomatic victory. Now you have Domination, 3 science victories and Contact is basically a luck victory if you find the right artifacts....-The game is incredulously easy to beat even on the hardest difficulty. The AI is pathetic, not agressive enough and still awful at fighting wars.-The spy system that was advertised as deeper than civ5 is weak. It takes way too long to use the additional options from spies unless you use an exploit. And even it's not very interesting.-Favors, advertised as a way to manipulate AI ended up falling flat. It's only purpose is to exploit the AI to get many loans of gold.-A quest system is in the game but some quests are bugged and many decisions in them are just stupid bonuses that never feel like a choice due to the terrible balance of the options.-No civilization leaders, lack of soul. No leader introductions with voiceovers, barely any context.There are some stuff I like:-Combat animations and unit models-Outpost mechanics-Artifacts-The tech tree and virtue treeBut that is it. And sadly the rest make it an unworthy challenge for any strategy fan.It's really with astonishing wonder that they got so much stuff wrong after 5 years of civ5. A game that was heavily copied to get this one.If you have never played Civilization 5, please buy Civilization 5 Complete instead of Civ:BE. It's a way more interesting product. It has some issues but you will find a lot more appealing than this one. If youre a fan of Civ5 but are a little bored this may entertain you for 50hours or so but be warned.This review was made with v1.0 Maybe some patches will fix some of my issues... maybe.

												Not recommended for anyone who still remembers and loves Alpha Centauri. This game simply lacks the charm of extraterrestrial exploration. It's not easy to pinpoint what, exactly, is wrong with it: maybe it's the lack of AC's narrative elements that popped up after each significant achievement of your faction. Maybe it's because we have nations again instead of factions. Or perhaps it's because the aliens are not menacing at all - once you've researched some basic upgrades, you can steamroll over anything but sea giants, and those are pretty passive. So BE basically boils to good old faction vs. faction warfare.Plus, compared to AC, this game is very simplistic. Domestic policies with special bonuses and drawbacks? Not anymore! Because all players love Civ5 culture advancements that are strictly positive and boil down to ""+5% to military unit strength"", right? Of course, option to design your own units is also gone, as well as psi-combat. Everything is as simplified as possible.And the most baffling design decision of all involves affinities: they are not mutually exclusive! So you can be a human purist who aspires to become a half-alien hybrid while modding himself with cybernetic augmentations to high heavens. And of course, descriptions (for example, in diplomacy screens) never acknowledge how ridiculous this monstrosity is. Nice work, Firaxis.			",224,58,2,60,23,0,54

												I had high hopes for this game and was really looking forward to seeing what next Civilization would bring us.  While some parts of the game were great and loved a few of the new mechanics the game is incomplete.  This feels similiar to what they did with Civilization V; releasing a game but leaving out some many of the mechanics that would make the game complete.  Simply put Beyond Earth is only 1/2 (or maybe 1/3) of the game it was meant to be.  What I worry is that Sid Meier's is going to put out DLC to fill out the game.  I have played better Civ V mods that did a better job of incorperating and making  changes to the base game.   It would be better to just wait for all of their DLCs to come out and then wait to the whole package goes on sale for 75% off.  Don't give Sid Meier any more money for an unfinished product.

												First review ever. I am a huge Civ fan, and strategy fan in general. Sad to say i have not enjoyed this game. As i played i realized why i liked the Civilization franchise; all the potential histories and unfolding of the world stage. This game does not give me that feel or that desire to invest long play times to achieve a goal. I dont even like the art style, colors blend too much and hard to distinguish various terrains, mesema, objects. The tech tree looks have changed but it is the same. If i could i would ask for my money back on this one. Looking forward to 5 yrs from now and the next Civ game. Just bring it back to Earth.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I wanted to be sure that my initial feeling stays or changes after more than 15 hours of play.Unfortunatelly I'm really disappointed by CBE. I'm overhyped fan and spent hundreds of hours playing CIV V (and probably much more in previous parts).I need to say that CBE shows nothing more, I feel like playing just a reskinned mod. This game is not an evolution not to mention revolution.If you ar enot huge fan of the game, it is better to wait for a sale or some kind of ""Complete Edition"" with all addons (which the games has been most probably stripped off).Biggest disappointment of the 2014 for me.

												To be honest, i don't see why people seem to hold this game in contempt. It offers all the essentials of a Civilization game plus a few extra features all in a new and unique setting. It seems unjust to churn out negative reviews for trying something new.			",52,14,0,17,22,1,31

												Experience the spiritual successor to Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri, which despite 15 years of technological advancement decides to remove pretty much most of the features that made the 1999 original so amazing, and hopes we'll shut our eyes to it because this game has GRAAAPHIIICS. Speaking of graphics, experience the sequel to Sid Meier's Civilization V, which despite 4 years more technolocially advanced than it's predecessor has very few noticeable graphical improvements to it's predecessor and a completely dumbed down UI. It also throws away pretty much most of the good features of Civ 5 making this completely new game more bland than the vanilla Civ 5. In short, this is is an incomplete game, which has barely enough balanced features to make it playable, and ""expansion packs"" or DLC will likely be released soon to ""complete it"" even though it was discovered that some of the missing features are within the games code, simply locked for now (until maybe a DLC will unlock it). I had high hopes of this game and rode the hype train and was ultimately disappointed. Do yourself a favor and stay away and stay away or get Civ 5 (or any previous Civ), which is pretty much the same game but much better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Review takes more effort than I'd like to give to this so, just a few Q/A.Is It Better Than Civ 5? No. It's Civ 5 in space with alien barbarians and a tech tree on slow mode.Is It A Bad Game? No. It's worth a few plays.Should I Buy It Now? Not at all. It's not worth the launch price.Why? False advertising. There is no multiplayer. It may say there is multiplayer, but playing it as such is impossible. Like everything else it was copy-pasta'd from Civ 5 and given a different skin, except much worse.Overall: If you like single player only and enjoy civ games, wait for the price drop and it is worth it. Otherwise, wait for something else.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have been a fan of the Sid Meier's series for years and thoroughly enjoyed playing all of them so far. I would not recommend this latest one though because this is not a full game, This is only the first part of the game and to get the full experience of the game, not just for the added bonuses, you have to buy the expensive expansion ""Rising Tide"". After purchasing the expansion, the game is great fun and has many new features which make the gameplay interesting and dynamic.I would have purchased this game for the price of the two downloads combined but to release a half finished game and then to release 'an expansion' which is actually just the rest of the game is verging on dishonesty. Also this game has now decided to stop starting and I can no longer play it.I hope they get the next one right but I will be reading the reviews thoroughly before I purchase it.			",43,1,1,0,0,0,11

												The game is timid in every way.  The design is so hide-bound in appealing to everyone that it feels like it has pitiful appeal to anyone.The science is weak, the extremities of the various affinities is even weaker and each feels completely without any character whatsoever.  They're visually less interesting than Civ V leaders and lacking the depth and personality of Alpha Centauri leaders.The lack of wonder or end-game cinematics is disappointing, the aliens are largely reskins of models that the player can get with no interesting mechanics whatsoever.  They're boring and less intimidating than early barbarians in standard Civ games and offer far less alien intensity than Alpha Centauri.This game is poor when viewed as a sequel to Civ V AND when viewed as an inheritor to Alpha Centauri.  A fail on both counts is impressive.The quests are a moderately interesting idea but still provide almost no sense of ownership.			",43,36,0,34,13,1,33

												The Good:  You have not bought this game yet and can make an informed decision. The Bad:  While this game does have a few very minor improvements over Civ 5, it is also missing a lot of things from Civ 5.  For example, the virtue system is a bit better than the Civ 5 civic choices, but instead of city states, you get stations which are only good for trading with.   The enemy AIs have no personality.  This is NOT a remake of Alpha Centari, not by a long strech.  At best this is nothing more than a mod for Civ 5.  The AI is just as dumb and the diplomatic AI makes no sense whatsoever.  You might as well not even have diplomacy.  The Ugly:  If there was an Alpha Centari mod for Civ 5, it would be a better game in almost every other way.  If you like games like Civilization and do not own Civ 5, then buy it with all the DLC for less money than this game with no DLC.  You will get a much better game.  I sure hope they fix this game and make it good, but as it stands in its current state (I am not talking about bugs, but game design), its garbage.  CIv 5 is a better game in every way.

												I dont know really know where to start.First time, I played it on the easiest setting, since I didnt want any tutorials, and I find its the easiest way to learn to play a Civ game.So what i found is the new ""hostiles"" are a bit of a novelty, once you've taken one out and researched a few techs, they're pretty much obselete, not much the persistant hostiles you want.I was hoping for a far deeper and richer game, the new tech tree was good, allthough confusing at times, until you realise your ""racing"" the other civs to research the required techs for the end game scenario, then you realise this is a ""fastest researcher wins"" game, which pretty much turns the game into a predictable grind, all you end up doing is hunting down the other civ's end game wonders, a new feature i do actually like since the wonder is built on a tile you can attack independant of the city itself.I recommend playing Civ IV Beyond The Sword. You'll enjoy it far more.			",217,27,7,17,9,0,76

												""Beyond Earth"" is not at all a bad game. I enjoyed my time with it so far, and I believe it's a solid addition to the 4x genre.Yet, it has drawn a lot of criticism from gamers. I think the main ""problem"" of Beyond Earth is that it carries the legacy of not only one, but _two_ immensely popular games (Alpha Centauri, and Civ 5), and it cannot really pull ahead of either of those.BE borrows most of its mechanics directly from Civ 5. They just got renamed - ""happiness"" became ""health"", ""gold"" became ""energy"", etc. Most mechanics of the Civ 5 expansions were not included in BE, which is a problem for many Civ 5 players, who tend to think that the expansions were what made Civ 5 enjoyable. BE does try to add some new things: The tech web allows very flexible research strategies. The victory conditions are new ideas, fit the setting, and are mechanically solid. The ""orbital layer"" adds tactical depth (but seems underused). So the innovation _is_ there, but only in some details, so veteran Civ 5 players will still get the feeling that they ""lost"" the Civ 5 expansion content and are basically playing an elaborate mod of the Civ 5 base game.BE borrows most of its _setting_ from its spiritual predecessor, Alpha Centauri. It can't use the exact same setting due to legal issues, but the parallels are obvious. Unfortunately, the setting is BE's weakest point. Where Alpha Centauri featured interesting characters, an overarching story of the planet's exploration, and a clash of ideologies that permeated every fiber of the game (down to leaders providing voiceovers with ideologically colored, well written comments about researched technologies), BE feels surprisingly bland in that regard. It feels as if the devs didn't even try to flesh out the setting, but just took some civs from Civ 5 and reskinned the leaders. Coincidentally, there is currently another 4x game on the market (Endless Legend) which has its strengths exactly in the lore and atmosphere aspects, which makes BE's shortcomings in that regard all the more obvious.Unfortunately, BE also fails to correct that one major flaw of ""Alpha Centauri"" - the weak AI. The game sticks to the ""one unit per tile"" paradigm from Civ5, and the AI still can't handle it. The AI is incapable of positioning its forces efficiently, it doesn't read the terrain well, and it still cannot plan ahead simple movements. I've seen units being sent into certain death because the pathfinding insisted to send them through miasma tiles when other options were available. I've seen the same unit going back and forth a dozen times when I simply opened or blocked a passage. I've seen AI units sitting uselessly on the same spot for ages. I've seen the AI sacrificing a dozen planes to my interceptors instead of using the ""sweep"" mission just once. I've seen an AI from another continent first sending a colonist to mine, then settling there without sending any units, and then (after I conquered the outpost) asking for peace and offering me one third of their empire: a full-fledged city on their continent, that I hadn't even discovered yet, so I posed no threat to that AI whatsoever.That said, if you strip away the legacy of Civ 5 and Alpha Centauri, then BE is quite a decent game. It still has complex gameplay (just don't focus on what was ""lost"" compared to the other games), it still has an interesting setting (just don't focus on how SMAC's setting was much more enticing), it does bring interesting new things to the table. It _is_ very enjoyable as a 4x game, the mechanics are solid, and it's not as bug-ridden as new 4x games tend to be.Since the game itself seems decent, BE's ""not being able to escape its legacy"" issue would probably not be much of a problem _if_ the game were priced accordingly, at perhaps 30€. With an initial price tag of 50€, though, I think people started focusing on what BE is not, instead of appreciating what it is. Coincidentally, it's on sale for 30€ now, and I believe that it's worth that. It would probably have received a much warmer welcome if it had been offered for that price from the start.

												Civ 5 is pretty much my favorite game,beyond earth is another story.Here are just a few rants I come up with:1)The whole landscape looks freaking gloomy and ugly;2) tons of bugs,we all saw the explorer-jogging-forever glitch in those preview builds,they say they are going to fix it,well,NO THEY DIDN'T.While all the bugs they did not fix in civ 5,obviously still exists;3)Extremely imbalanced gameplay,Apollo(highest difficulty) is a cakewalk,no improvements on AI whatsoever;but the most game breaking of all are the internal trade routes,way too powerful;4)Where are the demographics screen?!!City list?!And global politics screen doesn't even tell you which factions are at war with each other?!If you want to reskin the entire Civ 5,at very least keep all those good stuff,do we have to buy some""Info pack DLC"" in the future?Not surprised if they do release it.5)I understand there will be more factions coming in DLC's,but 8 factions only?!That's just pathetic.6)Each city can have up to 3 trade routes,each trade route must be manually reassigned every 20 turns,so if you have more than 30 cities in the late game and want to find the best trade route among a long list of cities...enjoy!(unlike in civ 5,there is no ""sort by highest gold"" option)7)Almost forgot to mention,they did not even make a single scenario;Overall,this game is,as everyone said,a reskin of civ 5,but feels extremely rushed and missing so much stuff,just like civ 5 back upon release,I do have faith in Firaxis coming up with great DLCs,but at this state I cannot say this game worth the price.

												I remember a news feature on a guy who has been playing a game of Civilization 2 for the past ten years. The world had been reduced to three factions, each in perpetual war and every single turn over a hundred nuclear devices would be produced and detonated. The game was a total stalemate and the planet had been reduced to an uninahibtable ball of dirt.Beyond Earth proposes the outcome of the end of the world. Beyond Earth picks up right where the science victory (or the nuclear holocaust) has left the planet. The world has suffered a horrible man-made calamity and now the people flee to the stars in order to find a new home. You take control of a sponsored faction. Make planetfall on a planet with an above average sustainability and you begin to colonise. Beyond Earth essentially is just Civ 5 with a very elaborate reskin, but there is more to it than that. The standard Civ games retell the journey of mankind through the ages. Beyond earth explored the unknown; the final frontier, and with it come some new considerations. For instance, your faction will need to make decisions regarding the local wildlife, refugees from less fotunate factions and most importantly: the local wildlife. Unlike earth, where the occasional barbarian would kidnap your workers, the planet pays host to a remarable menagerie of extra terrestial horrors. From the small wolf beetle to the awe inspiring siege worms; your military's first task will be to control the monsters, before you seek to undo your fellow humans. Because you're in the future now you'll no longer be inventing things like the wheel or dynamite. We're taking gene splicing and nano technology here. The tech tree has been refurbished into the tech web. Your choice for military R&D might eventually lead you away from sustainability or prosperity or vice versa. You can choose your own technological agenda. Eventually, you'll have to decide how the human race will proceed. The game introduces an affinity system. You can pursue Purity, Supremacy or Harmony. Each affinity brings its own boons. As purist, you'll maintain humanity the Warhammer way; by shunning any and all foreign and alien influences to your technology or biology. It paves the way for incredible weapons and amazingly polarised world views. Supremacists fuse their bodies and minds with machines. The result is an efficient human race that seeks to remove any and all inefficiencies. Even if that means getting rid of biological components all together. Harmonists seek to use the new world and its bounties to their adavantage and eventually evolve to be at home in the hostile world. Each affinity comes with its own special victory. The purists claim the new world as their own, while the supremasists travel to earth to upgrade the people there. The harmonists transcend humanity as collective hivemind with the planet itself. Each victory requires a vastly different approach to resource and tech management, as well the application of your forces. The supremacists need to sacrifice their troops to subjugate the population on earth, while harmonists will want to keep their assets close to defend their cities before transcendence is achieved. Naturally, you can still just destroy all your enemies like back in the olden days with military might. Or you can go for a more peaceful solution and attempt to make first contact. The new world is open to any and all options. The whole newness is what makes this game so different then. It still works the same; turn based, resources, explore, dumb AI who can't value a deal. However, everything is new and looks differently. It is really hard to come to terms with unknown and in the first few games you play you'll be wondering if you're doing it right. In fact, even after a few turns you're wondering why the AI has such a great health record and why your cities are dying from disease and malnourishment. The game also lost a tick in its pace. Somehow it feels slower. Between the many new technologies, you won't notice much of a change until you reach a certain level of affinity. It makes your actions seem useless and it kind of ruins the game as it slips into its fourth quarter. The late game units are a blast to use when you can, simply because of their insane proportions, but it takes too long to get them, and you won't have much time to use them. All in all, Beyond Earth is very familliar, but at the same time so outlandish and new that you'll feel like you're exploring new worlds. It's a nice change of pace when you're fed up with racing to build pyramids and stonehenge. The aliens allow for a more active use of your military than in regular Civ and that is a nice step up. However, the crash in pace might turn some people away. If you like Civ and sci fi, then this is certainly for you.			",192,21,8,22,19,2,33

Have you tried Civ5? You haven't? Try and then come back!Firstly, To those who haven't played Civilization V I recommend to go back and play that instead, and then come back here. When you've had enough of Civ5 then comes time for this expansion standalone game called Beyond Earth. Still it's a really nice expansion of the basic game, pretty enjoyable, so why all that negativity? Maybe the reason is that Beyond Earth still feels more like Mode or DLC for Civ5 not overcharged standalone that it is. Nevertheless if we put this fact aside and focus on the gameplay and other aspects of the game, Beyond Erth together with its major expansion Rising Tide still can be an amazing piece which can offer dozens of hours of fun. Pros✪ Virtues and personal traits - Cultural and political development as in previous titles is nice, simple and gently improves the gameplay.✪ Victories - New possibilities of how to win enhanced with more than just ""build and win"" (some of them)✪ Affinities - You can choose, depending on your gamestyle, which path you will go down. Purity, supremacy or harmony. Progress is made through technologies you research, quests you complete and decisions you make during the game.  ✪ Unit upgrades - Unit improves and changes their appearance depending on affinities you chose. ✪ Quests and decisions Neutral✪ TechTree - it's nice loooking on some different ""exotic"" kind of techtree (techWeb here) than we are accustomed to. Nevertheless it feels like most of the tech is useless when you get some first esencials. In later stages of the game I clicked on anything just to have some research progress though not needing any. Cons✪ AI is immensely stupid and not balanced. Increasing difficulty feels only like AI has many factors favouring his civilization, but the same playstyle. If you attack even the strongest AI early in the game, it can be extremely weakened and won't be able to compete with you afterwards.✪ No scenery, No campaign, just skirmish.✪ There is not much of a difference between civilizations you choose to play as. The only differences are colour on the map, leader appearence and one minor almost not recognizable benefit.✪ There are no leaderboards, no history and no record on anything when you finish the game. I just want to know info about what every player focused on and what every competing civilization did the whole game. 6.5 /10 The game is fun and enjoyable overall, but I do not feel like it has much progress next to the previous titles. I recommend only those who played properly Civ5 and are looking for something familiar.			",320,92,7,54,60,4,68

Its boring, 200 turns in and only 2 or so wonders have been built in the game thus far... No Alien issues whatsoever, more turtle AI from CIV V.Perhaps after they milk the IP after 2 more expansions... stay away for now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Beyond Earth is not a huge departure from its predecessor, Civilization V. Now that we've got that out of the way, I think your impression of this game might depend largely on your expectations. If you're expecting something revolutionary and different then you might want to wait for this one to go on sale so it's comparably priced to a DLC or an expansion and continue to patiently wait for Civilization VI, which Beyond Earth is not.  If you want a solid 4x game with great graphics, a gorgeous color palette, beautiful map terrain and cool resources, immersive music, an interesting premise, and chock full of sci-fi references, then you'll probably enjoy this. I can't stop playing it, I just want to test out all the new victory types and see what all the units look like after upgrades attached to each of game's the three affinities. Even though much of the game -- from the UI to the AI -- feels familiar, there's enough that's fresh that you have to pay attention to the details. And I keep finding myself pleasantly surprised by the new stuff I discover. And sometimes I find myself familiarly irritated by some of the things that have plagued most incarnations of Civilization games, like repetitive AI that offers insanely lopsided trade ""deals"" and then launches an attack a turn after telling you how awesome you are.I really like the addition of quests to the game, even though sometimes it's difficult or even impossible to complete some of the tasks (also wow fragile explorers). Once you accept that though, the tasks you can do become a nice little addition to the game and a way to earn extra bonuses while you're playing.On the down side, the end-game tends to drag a bit, and some of the victory conditions have ""false summits"" in which you think you are almost there but then find out that you have to have to jump through hoops for another 50 turns in order to actually win.I wish there were some more statistical and information options for those of us who like to really delve deeply in our strategy games and think things through completely before committing to a path. I also wish there were more incentives to cooperate with the other colonies, like science and economic boosts for signing cooperation agreements. I'd have liked more emphasis on science, perhaps via the ability to enter into research agreements through diplomacy or the ability to trade techs like in earlier Civ games.Overall, I'd say that the fact that I played the game for over 40 hours in less than a week speaks to its value, at least in my eyes. It's not perfect, but it's a lot of fun and it definitely has that ""one more turn"" factor that makes it a solid addition to the Civ family.			",794,344,20,160,177,6,235

												 It is evident, after spending 18.7 hours with the game, that Civ Beyond Earth was shoved out the door way too early. Don't really understand why, when Civ fanbase is the most patient fanbase I know.  The most egregious example, is the lack of support of HDTV's, or the now infamous ""120 Hz resolution problems"", a problem that doesn't and didn't exist for ANY other Firaxis product. My review in just one sentence : The game had a lot of potential and it is evident that developpers had ambitious goals with the title, but when playing the final product, one can't help but feel as if large parts of the game  got hacked out or never finished. I'll elaborate on that : For example, there are a lot of technologies and it is fun to explore them, but some technologies only offer one building and an affinity boost and nothing else. It feels  as if a part of the team did their job and the other didn't. Also, speaking of technologies, the ""Tech web"" or technology tree is non-intuitive and is nearly impossible to spot out wonders (unless you look closely at the cost of the building). As other reviewers have pointed out, there is a severe lack of polish (again, this adds to the feeling that BE was rushed) with very few voice over work, lackluster wonders, boring Diplomacy interface and lackluster victory screens.  Also, it seems that some mechanics were rushed (the favor and intrigue mechanic) and didn't reach their full or intended potential. The ""favor"" mechanic for example, is basically a new currency when trading with an AI. It should help you force trades that would otherwise be impossible or very expensive, but in the end, a favor point basically amounts to about 50 energy. That's it.  I hope future patches or expansion packs will help Beyond Earth reach its full potential, but everyone that has pre-ordered the game, like me, are left dissapointed and most of all frustrated that this game wasn't given more attention/money. DON'T BUY, wait for a better game and get the (inevitable) GOTY/definitive edition or whatever... and NEVER preorder.			",45,10,0,9,2,0,15

												I don't write reviews but in this case i feel it's my duty to warn potential buyers. This game(at release) lacks any type of inspiration or character and on top of that they have allowed the game to go out without all the resolutions available. If you own a 120hz or 144hz you will be forced to play in windowed mode if you want 1080p. And if that's not bad enough it's now been 6 weeks since release and not 1 patch to address any of the games numerous problems. As far as Fireaxis goes, i will never buy one of there games again at release. I have no problem waiting for the inevitable 5 DLCs and Steam sales that will allow me to buy the Complete Edition at -80% off. I suggest you do the same.			",266,83,4,43,28,3,41

												I played this as a direct continuation of my Civ V game, so with that being said i didn't expect more than expansion.Enjoyed the tone of the game and familiar mechanics, some parts are shallow or feeling missing. But once again I didn't come in expecting a groundbreaking 4x game, I wanted Sci-fi  and Civ fused.MP works fine and well, had some fun with sunbros. I have yet to try the DLC, but i hear its what the game needed. Cannot confirm that at this moment.That being said, take it or leave it. I will say, that if this game isn't for you, but want that Sci-fi feel...try Endless Space8/10*EDIT AS OF 05/23/16So far i really like the DLC, adds a lot of new elements i would have liked to seen on release, but then again I am just happy to have it.

IntroFIrst off, I'm a long time Civ fan, and turn-based strategy may be my favourite genre. I was NOT as big of a fan of Alpha Centauri as many of the other games, but I was really excited nontheless. TL:DR: I went back and forth multiple times on whether or not to give this a positive. If you're a fan of the series, buy it, you'll have fun, but be a little disappointed. On the other hand, some newcomers to turn-based might be able to stomach this.ObservationsFirst thing you'll notice when you download this game is the size - only 2-something gigabytes. That will be nice for those without a solid internet connection.Unfortunately, that size hints at one of the biggest problems I have with this game.  There seems to be a general lack of quality artwork. Dating back to Civ 2 (my first, which I played when I was 9) I loved the animations, music, and artwork associated with technologies, wonders, and ultimately, victory. (Probably a bigger deal as a kid) Games back then made up for the inability to create kickass graphics with awesome animations, graphics, and audio as rewards along the way. Age of Empires 1 was the same way.Nowadays, the work goes into nice 3d gameplay, but the artwork, lore, and music just aren't there. The older Civ games put tons of time into writing beautiful descriptions and background for each technology and game concept. In BE, it's mostly short blurbs. Technology has no real artwork.Wonders are even worse, only having some vague blueprint thing and short clip of text. I have no idea what I built most of the time, and the bonuses are spotty and generally uninspiring.Victories are similarly lacking in artwork. The glorious travel to Alpha Centauri featured in all the other Civ installments is replaced by a quote and kind of crappy artwork. This is especially sad since the authors had so much potential to work with. Some compelling storylines with clear conclusions would have also been nice.PositivesThe world itself is beautiful, done much better than Alpha Centauri in my opinion. It was a joy to play in. Units are designed well, and it is bright. Alpha Centauri's interface was always a little dark for me.Tutorial system - Yeah yeah, a little annoying at times, but I thought the click-through tutorials that pop up were really well done, and might help casual gamers get past the initial curve.Unit progression - I like that units aren't just obsoleted, but that they are carried through the game and automatically upgraded. The unit experience system is MUCH better in BE; they split out the experience system from V and made the more impactful decisions globalTech Tree - The tech tree in Beyond Earth is less linear than any that I've seen, and it gives a lot of freedom for advancement. My strategy is usually to go balls-to-the-wall science, and get an age up on my competitors in order to blow them away with modern technology. Not so straightforward this time around, and I like that.Civilization concept - Instead of civilizations with their own bonuses, the player chooses their 'race' based on the technology choices they make, and gain unique units as a result. I think I like it, but at the same time, it was an easy way for them to get out of making a lot of quality art. Reminded me of Planetside 2.Intrigue  - I  liked the diplomacy concept. Stealing tech is actually pretty useful. I wish it would show the tech popup when I discover a technology by stealing it though.More NegativesThe diplomacy was lame, characters were downright uninspiring. I never got offers for anything other than 'favors' from the AIThe trade system has some cool concepts, but my biggest gripe is that it seems WAY overpowered. Close to the end of the game, I could build a settlement literally anywhere and have it capable of building almost any unit in a couple turns. There was also never a good reason for me to trade with one of the outposts or another civilization. When I play $50+ for a game, I expect replay value. One way that the older civs achieved this was with a high-score system that would berate you for how crappy you were. I miss that. No such mechanic here. Tell me how bad I am!This probably won't affect most of you, but as someone who has been gaming with Eyefinity (3 monitor setup) for the last few years, I'm getting really tired of companies calling a game 'Eyefinity approved' and slapping an AMD logo on it when in reality they have done nothing of the sort. It plays fine with Eyefinity (and I imagine nVidia Surround) but the interfaces are on the far left and right. So I'm always looking back and forth. It would have been SO easy for them to allow the UI to be centered on the middle display.ConclusionOverall, I enjoyed it, but I'm not about to go play another game right now. I would recommend that you all buy it when it comes around for $10 this summer, then give it a play-through.			",65,11,0,10,11,0,14

												Civilization: Beyond Earth will look and feel familiar to Civ V players, but this is not simply a sci-fi remake of Civ V. The game is far more tactical, which will please long-time strategy game players. The alien worlds are gorgeously detailed and provide new challenges to players. The integrated quest system serves to highten your game experience by giving you opportunities to mould your civilisation beyond the endless build, expand, build gameplay of previous Civilization entries, thereby allowing a great deal of customisation. Alien life is complex enough to be pleasing and genuinely terrifying if you don't keep an eye on alien nests.Diplomatic functions are exactly the same as Civ V's, which is not a surprise given that BE is built on the same engine - there are some expanded functions but nothing inherently noteworthy. Future expansions might play with diplomacy a bit but for now, if you've played Civ V, you know exactly how to run the diplomatic system.The Virtue system works incredibly well. Gone are the nine policy trees - you now have four, called Virtues, but they are divided into three tiers, and completing each tier gives you significant bonuses. This allows the game to acheive a far more interesting level of complexity than Civ V's policies. You can choose to max out a Virtue tree, or mix it up a bit depending on needs. Each tree is as viable as one another, so gone are the days of maxing Patronage to secure an easy win.The technology web, so highly touted by Firaxis, is implemented well. Each technology has high strategic value, and Firaxis did well to incorporate Harmony, Supremacy and Purity points throughout the tree. You don't need to research everything, and in fact can research any branch at any time - no need to wait forever for that one technology that will confer that bonus you've wanted since turn one. There are some slight graphical issues, but those will be fixed in an upcoming patch. Tiles can and will flicker occassionally, which gets annoying, and the only way to fix it is to save and reload the game. It's not a huge deal though - the rest of the game is beautifully polished.Don't be surprised if this is the AAA game of the year. 10/10.			",93,29,0,31,19,0,27

												This game continues to fail to work.It can be casually enjoyed  as a 4X  because there are no showstopper bugs.  I don't know why I would recommend any game for that purpose, though.Technical problems:Trade routes have an arbitrary and obscure value determination.  Trade routes are still clunky to renew.  Trade routes received a total redesign after complaints of absolute imbalance ....  resulting in their being arbitrary and strange, and will continue to spiral into weirdness without some solid sense of what they're supposed to even be.The affinity quest bug persists.Unit combat is fundamentally imbalanced.Wonders do not even do anything.  This is not hyperbole - they literally do not function.Titanium is imba.Miasma continues to defy the interface, forbidding intuitive options like ""wake when miasma starts killing this unit.""Aesthetic problems:You don't love the planet, you don't love the leaders.  You don't even love your own civ.  You cannot care less about what's going on.  The alien taming is a novelty, not enjoyable.Health dominates the entirety of the virtues decision tree, strategically speaking.  There is nothing but Prosperity into Colonist into health virtues.If you want to roleplay.... roleplay with what?  The leaders aren't psychotic (as much)... but they still can't express any personality because there's nothing to express it in.  There is no diplo interaction.  This game has no luxes so there's just one -less- thing to pretend to mutually support each other about.And the irony being that the entirety of gameplay involves building, as rapidly as you can, an industrial complex that exploits every hexagonal inch of the planet's surface... because that's all there is to the game.  There are no subcity elements to contend with.  No sustainability problems.  No corruption or empire contentment.  The affinities actually have no natural animosity for each other, the A.I.s just act like they do.Sci-fi is cool.  4X is cool.  And Civilization maintains its certain style of branding that comes through in the tone of things, in the character designs, in the  look-and-feel of the advanced gameplay elements - the ""wow cool"" of the components that comes from the designers' enthusiasm.  And the game sucks.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A terrible disappointment. From the announcements, it was supposed to be a SMAC spiritual successor. What we were given is a re-skin of Civilization V with lackluster writing and shoddily-coded stubs instead of new features.Here is a short list of most annoying problems.Affinities, one of the core elements of the game, are poorly thought out and implemented. There is nothing that prevents you from trying to max out all three of them, but the AI will only count the highest one and chastise you for your choice even if you have more points in their chosen affinity than them. Other than that and requiring different resources, they don't change your gameplay too much. Harmony doesn't make you more at tune with the planet; in fact, you will probably kill more aliens than ever, because their nests tend to spawn on Xenomass which you need for your units. Supremacy and terraformation don't upset aliens one bit and one of the first bonuses you get actually make them never attack your explorers, Beyond the flavor, all three paths to victory are pretty much the old Spaceship victory.Aliens are a non-factor. They will rarely ever attack your units and won't go through your borders most of the time. Once I were taking potshots at the siege worm with ranged units for about 30 turns and it seemed content to just wander around and mind its business. I'm not sure why they are even in game, because they certainly don't hinder or help the player in any way.Braindead, passive AI. It doesn't explore too well, expands quite slowly and doesn't even try to compete for resources. It also doesn't engage in any meaningful diplomacy. Three leaders will repeatedly pester you with cooperation and open borders treaties, speaking the same line every time. The rest will almost never interact with you except to complain about some random things (like removing miasma from your own city or exploring Progenitor ruins beyond their borders which they didn't touch since the beginning of the game). Sometimes they also ask you for free stuff. They will rarely, if ever, go to war. When they do, they tend to never send enough units to even make a dent in your city. You can spend an entire game just sitting in your corner of the world and researching technologies, never having to fight anyone.Blandness and bad writing. Building a wonder usually gets you something that looks like a technical outline and +x to Production/Science/Food/something else. Leaders are devoid of any character whatsoever and you won't get any information about them without actively searching for them in Civilopedia. The devs promised the characters' appearance will change with each path and it kinda does - they wear slightly different clothes. The factions are: Space Russia, Space France, Space USA, Space Brasil, Space China, Space India, Space Australia and Space Africa. There are 5 different ways to win the game, except that 4 of them are pretty much the same one but requiring different techs and buildings.To sum it all up, the game simply isn't worth $50. I could maybe justify buying it for this price if it actually had decent, but unpolished content that needs a few patches and maybe an expansion to fully shine. The main problem with Beyond Earth is that it doesn't actually show much potential - the new core features simply don't work out and the poor quality of the game content suggests it was done on a budget. It's better to wait until it's cheaper.			",33,19,1,14,24,2,17

It feels just like Civ 5 in new skin.That is basically what it is.If that is enogh for you, this will be a great game.If you hoped for more... disappointment awaits.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Civ V with a new skin. The game feels stripped down, like something is missing. I'm betting, knowing Firaxis, that it will take two DLCs, just like Civ V, to make this an interesting game. I have not had any technical issues, the game runs very well, but I find myself comparing the new units and game play to Civ V and then using the same strategies to play. Artwork and music are very nice. Unit icons take some getting used to, it's very difficult to tell by the icons what units do what. For interstellar races, aircraft ranges are baffling short and why land and sea going vessels are still being used is a big question.  At the end Civ V you have X-Com jump troops, so why, after 600 years, do I have Infantry plodding about on foot, 1-2 hexes per turn? Oh that's right, the basic infantry in this game are the warriors in Civ V. Waiting until the Gold Edition with all DLCs is released, on sale, to pick this one up. Anyone want to play Civ V?

												Beyond Earth is the combination of Civilisation 5 and Alpha Centuri's lest memorable game mechanics and ideas.The game has 8 very forgettable fractions. During the game, you will have the choice between 3 paths with different life philosophies. These paths will turn your allies agains you for no reason other than prejudice by the AI.This game lacks many of the ideas and mechanics that made Alpah Centuri so popular but is still able to remain addictive.This game is an inferior product in comparison to Alpha Cenuri, Civilisation 5, Endless Legend and almost every game of its genre.Buy only if it is on sale, otherwhise wait for it to have more content.

Beyond Earth is an unfortunate moniker. There is nothing ""beyond"" about this game. Damned near every feature that one expects from a Civilizations title is inexplicably missing in this itteration.And there is absolutely no reason for it.What Firaxis has offered is a stable late-beta ""demo"" game for $49.99. As a finished product. There is so much missing that you can't help but notice them and mention to yourself that you'll see 'em in the later ""expansion"" DLCs. Which means this lackluster game was purposefuly made, as is, to be geared towards taking more of your money just so the player can have the things that have been expected and seen in past Civilizations base games.I no longer trust this company for producing good product. Xcom showed us the direction they're going and Beyond Earth confirmed it.Other game companies out there (notably Iceberg Interactive and Stardock Games) are producing better, prettier and smarter strategy games for fractions of Firaxis' production costs. These same companies also have a history of providing quick updates and extra material free. Their DLC's of the past have always been expansions of already well crafted games.Any Beyond Earth DLCs will not be expansions, but finalization of game mechanics and artwork that should have already been in there.The game is bland. It has next to no honest replay value. There is no ""push"" nor needful purpose for finishing the game. Consequently you'll find yourself quickly bored.The AI is more or less a joke, their drive-by diplomatic messages become incredibly annoying and are quickly nonsensical in most contexts that they're delivered in. The AI's use of military units on the harder difficulties are a study in confusion, especially accounting for the fact that there aren't that many unit variations.Faction choices (Civilizations) are appalling. They're not distinctive. The larger maps will leave one or two factions out in the♥♥♥♥♥end of nowhere. Adding more factions to counter that means having clones, which will definitely knock immersion.Ability choices that are used to set apart your factions from others really don't accomplish the job. Too many choices aren't good ones, compelling the player to choose from the same set. So you'll be seeing the different factions making the same variation of choices you do in multi-player.The story enters with a whimper and then quietly dies. But that's okay because you barely notice its passing anyway.I told myself and I told others that I wouldn't be getting this game on launch. They really dropped the ball on Xcom but I figured, ""Hey, it's a Civ game...there is no way they'd screw that up!"".I was wrong. To my vast sorrow.This game is a blatant cash grab. You'll be required to purchase DLC's for the many, oh so many, features they purposely left out.Goodbye, Firaxis.			",49,11,0,16,8,0,21

Posted: June 16, 2015
												Relative to the other Civ games out there this is more than a step backwards. There are a lot of little things done wrong and I’ll try to hit on a couple as concisely as I can, addressing people familiar with Civ5.One of the problems is your opponents don’t start the game on the map, they drop in randomly at later turns. The same is true with this games version of city-states called outposts. So when you’ve explored at little like other Civ games you start to think about where your second city will go, but it’s extremely unlikely you’ll get to put one there without a fight because of outposts popping up. Instead of just worrying about other nations building a colony unit and grabbing the land you wanted, you have to deal with that plus cities and outposts popping up literally anywhere. All Civ games are random, but this adds a dynamic randomness that is just annoying.Another thing is the map is filled with “miasma,” which is green fog that damages units. It makes the game more tedious exploring and colonizing especially with the large amount of aliens (barbarians) floating around. You can also gain the ability to make this miasma not harmful to your units. But, even when your units are immune to it your automated workers will still clear it from tiles when it can only benefit you if your opponents aren’t immune to it. This just shows a lack of polish they were starting to gain in the series.Even little things like the quotes when you gain technology or build wonders aren’t as good. In the games where the quotes were tied to historical figures they were a lot more interesting. The made up quotes try to be funny or show personality but are mostly just stupid and don’t add to the flavor of the game.Another issue is all the buildings have secret abilities that you don’t know until you build one. Like you get to pick between two resources that all of the buildings of this type will produce. If you knew that ahead of time you might have chosen what buildings to build in a different order. As it is there is just more things to remember for the next game if you want to get good and play the game smart.The fluid technology paths just add to the sense that you’d really have to play the game a ton of times to make good choices on which order to do your research.It’s not complete crap, but it compares poorly to other Civ games in pretty much every way it is different.

I hated CivV at first, then the first major expanion (Gods and Kings) completely fixed the game. If they release something like that for BE, it'll be worth it.

												I do recommend this game if you expect the same as previous Sid Meier's game releases.If you expect something new, you'll be in for a disappointing déjà vu.I have been a huge fan of previous versions of Sid Meier's Civilization: I loved Alpha Centauri.Now, many years later, I bought Civilization: Beyond Earth.At the beginning, it was all fun. The graphics looked good; I liked the music a lot. But after some turns (about 100 or so) I realized there was NOTHING NEW about this game. For me it is a HUGE DEJA VU of Alpha Centauri.After being such a succesful game programmer, I really expected Sid Meier and Firaxis to turn up with something NEW; something innovative; something we hadn't seen before. I didn't expect this cheap program recycling. Because that is what it is, disguised in some modern graphics and sleeker design.- The aliens are boring. They're more of an obstacle on the road you just need to get rid of.- The landscape isn't very ""beyond Earth"". Except for some exotic resources, boring alien insects and fish and a greenish fog, I don't see anything ""beyond"".- What's with the resource pods? What the hell? Is that all the game designers could come up with for this ""beyond Earth"" world?!?! How boring and unimaginative! What about some alien technologies hidden in artifacts? Or strange ruins of civilizations long since disappeared? Nooooo: resource pods, abandoned outposts and bones. That's very, very ""beyond""...- I got HUGELY irritated by the stupid, moronic, illogical and backwards ""diplomacy"" in the single player game. The diplomatic behaviour of the other faction's ""AI"" is erratic at the very least. Wars are declared, condemnations are spoken for NO apparant reason but some random algorithm. The ""forgiveness"" in the diplomatic area when it comes to covert ops is extremely one-sided and highly undervalued compared to the ""AI's"" blatant and ongoing incursions despite made promises or demands. It is highly unbalanced, illogical and stupid. There is nothing ""I"" in the AI...This will probably be the last time I ever spend money on a Sid Meier's recycled game. It's Siphilization Beyond Boring. ",3,2,0,1,7,0,1

												Take the good stuff from Civ 5 and get rid of half of it.  Under no circumstances are you to improve the weak points of Civ 5, namely combat.  Now take a thesaurus and rename the remaining units, buildings, and quests into stuff that sounds like 'science'.  Make no effort to optimize how quickly the AI calculates its move.  Remove completely the score summary at the end of each round.  Finally, ensure the advisor function is as obnoxious as possible.Is the game finished? No.  Is the game fun?  No.  Is the game worth buying at full retail?  Absolutely not.Congratulations.  You have just created Civ 5 Beyond Earth.------------------This game, like any Civ game, has such potentia.

												The biggest thing holding me back on this game, compared to other Civ games (or the like), is the affinity system.  In theory, it is really cool.  I like how you can shape your playstyle and it is reflected in your units/buildings/victory type.  However, it really becomes apparent that if you are going to go for a specific victory, you really need to know that right at the start.  It doesn't really allow for adaptive gameplay.  Militarily, I find that it also makes the game suffer.  The biggest advancements come from seeking a specific affinty right from the get-go.  Choosing a research becomes a game of ""Which _____ would be quickest"" just to get a (devastatingly good) unit upgrade.  Again, you become really locked into what you choose right at the beginning.Civ 5, I felt, was completely polished by the last expansion; and it's kind of a shame that they didn't apply everything that was learned from that to this addition to the series.  Leaving out certain things such as the religion system or U.N. (rather, a setting-specific alternative) seems very short sighted.			",142,10,0,23,17,0,14

												As many said before, this game lacks soul. Most of the time you won't even know what you are researching or bulding, you only know (somewhat) why you are doing it. In my 2 games, the experience was pretty much the same. Start a game, have fun for 100 turns and then all becomes just a boring chore of clicking with your mouse. The wonders are unimportant and uninspiring and the endings of the game even more so. I don't know what they are doing with this game. It plays like some cheap clicking game that people play on fb. Affinities are a joke and the research tree is just some random made up names that do some things. And to top it off, the multiplayer is broken. Most of the time you get kicked by the host ( in reality, you are kicked by the game) and then if you find a game that has not started yet, wait for everyone to ready up and eagerly anticipate the game, just to see the game hardcrashing to the desktop. It's amazing how that is even possible, since the whole game is just a civ 5 with new colors.  This should be a 15EUR dlc and not a full price game. Do not buy unless on discount.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's hard to recommend this game when it's clearly so unfinished. The potential is there, but very few systems actually feel refined, leading to horrible balancing and concepts that wear thin after a few turns. With mods and expansions this could easily become a classic, but in its current vanilla state it's a huge step back for the series and proof that Firaxis hasn't learnt their lesson from the bland Civ V release.Highly disappointing.

												First off, let's talk about the cons. It's easy to praise and speak highly of something, but to give a fair and honest overview is another thing entirely.The leader choice, although not particulary very important, is limited. Seeing the same couple faces every game is a bit of a letdown, but not a real detriment. The look and feel also is very similar to Civ 5. It feels like a glorified reskin when it comes to the basic look of the game.On a neutral standpoint, the game is also very challenging. If you are coming here from Civ 5, prepare to be overwhelmed. Though I personally find this to be a good thing. A high skill ceiling means it will keep you entertained for many many hours to come.Now, onto the sugary bits. The most shining thing this game offers is its customization. It's as if they took Civs system, stripped it down to the bare bones, and gave the players the ability to customize their Civ to the T. You can be a focused empire or a hybrid empire and it is quite effective. The tech tree is overwhelming, but golden and offers so much creative freedom. Every game you will pick and choose the flavor of techs that matches your situation best. Mix and match to achieve what you deem worthy as the perfect Civ.Some say this should have been a Civ 5 expansion. I disagree. It has it's own standalone atmosphere, and offers one of the most flexible and robust tech trees i've ever seen in a 4x (And I'm a huge Endless Legend/Space fanboy). The music is also delicious, and the game flows very smoothly.I highly recommend this game. It will be a gem for years to come.			",460,98,4,108,53,2,80

												A B- game from a AAA publisher. It's like a bad Civ 5 mod. There is no polish to this game. Building the wonders is unspiring. All the voice acting is done by one person regardless of who the quote comes from.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. YOU WILL BE SEVERELY DISAPPOINTED. I AM VERY SAD I SPENT ANY MONEY ON THIS.INTERFACEThe interface is extremely lackluster, with very poor choices about how to navigate through menus. Even the menu design itself looks boring. All the icons are flat puesdo-gray scale images that would look better on a mobile app than in a AAA game. The trade route interface does not sort to maximize by science, energy, food, or production (as it did in Civ 5) and every 15 turns you have to renew each trade route, which becomes a huge time waste when you have 4 trade routes per city in the mid to late game. Trying to send people through the earth domination gate requires you to send military units one at a time for ~20 turns or so. This is a super frustrating experience.This bad UI is pervasive throughout the game. If you highlight the technologies based on a certain type, you can't select anything else but the ones you've filtered by, so you have to go back and unclick it.Moving a spy around requires multiple clicks through submenus when it should just be a single one.The workers seem much, much stupider than the ones in Civ 5. I've seen them get stuck multiple times while multiples are automated near each other, and they will bankrupt you with the -6 maintence improvement if you don't watch them. They also don't proiritize maglevs at all, which are just railroads from Civ 5.SatilletesThis is probably one of the most interesting, and equally dispapointing parts of the game. The satilletes come so late in the technology tree, and have such limited effects, that there are no interesting choices in boosting your production with them. You also can't stack them in any way.CombatThe combat is actually less interesting than in Civ 5 which is pretty painful. I don't know how you take a step back here. There are less units, and you can only upgrade them by researching one of the three foundational systems, and then you upgrade all of them exactly the same way.ResearchThe web tech tree is definitely a better setup than the linear one from Civ 5, but because of the three paradigms, it's much less expansive than it looks, you're virtually forced to pickup useless technologies because they happen to have a paradigm increase on them, which is super frustrating.MISCWonders have no visible improvement on the city. Energy and health are just money and happiness. The three paradigms of Adaptation, Purity, and Improvement are super boring. There's nothing interesting about them compared to the society alignments of Alpha Centarui.			",102,30,0,32,18,2,30

												There is a lot of potential here, but after my first campaign, I can't help but feel that a lot has been held back for the inevitable expansions. As a result, I got the feeling that the game was somehow incomplete. This is following the precedent set by Civ 5, so if Firaxis are going to continue in this way with all of their future releases, then I will probably just wait for the GOTY edition, rather than paying instalments to get a finished product.One inexcusable exclusion is the end of game summary screen. After game over, it's a brief message then back to main menu.			",204,54,8,24,29,4,46

												Left me beyond dissapointed. Really wish the demo came out first. Fell asleep multiple times thinking i was playing a watered down sci fi mod for Civ 5. Would really recommend playing the demo first before purchasing as you can't return it... something I regretably found out the hard way. I like the approach they tried to take but it simply doesn't have that Civ feel to it. New tech tree and affinity system just seem like hassles more than anything, the non-linear change to culture was nice though. Same base units stay with you pretty much through out the whole game and the little bonuses you can choose from don't diversify them well. I'd go on more but I'm tired and some other people covered real well why this is just watered down SciFICIv5.			",56,4,1,18,6,2,10

												I want so very badly to recomend this game, I dearly love the franchise and think firaxis is among the best studios out there today. However, this game just doesn't live up to the hype or the reputation that they have worked so hard to build.Where to begin with this game. I think the most obvious and perhaps worst aspect of this release is that it is such a thinly veiled clone of Civ 5. I feel ripped off paying $50 for what amounts to little more than a reskinned game from 2010 with a cool intro video. Sure, its fairly pretty, but its so unbelievably dull. I'm baffled that with a concept as fantastic and well-loved by fans they couldn't think up anything even slightly more engaging. There's no wonder videos (static pictures only), no dynamic cities that show the buildings they contain (already done for Civ IV), no interesting AAA voice acting for the tech tree, and paltry number of playable civilizations that differentiate the game exactly not at all. Unit design is also absent, with a very linear affinity-based upgrade system that is extremely unsatisfying next to the fully custom unit design system in Alpha Centauri, which made unit design a combination of economic, technological, and strategic considerations. While trade routes are a cool and immersive idea, they are done so poorly here that I wish they weren't included. Having to reassign these units every few turns makes my blood boil.This game was hailed as a ""spiritual successor"" to Alpha Centauri, but it shares nothing with the original, it's a obviously a functional game, but if you already own Civ V I highly reccomend you just keep on playing and wait for someone to do a real remake, which is what everybody was praying for, but sadly sometimes Sid Meier answers prayers with a resounding NO!Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go play some Alpha Centauri.

												After about 15 hours, it Still just feels like an expansive Civ 5 mod. You can already predict how it will mirror the Civ 5 expansions:  First DLC will have a few extra techs and units.  Then a new faction or 2.  Some new buildings and wonders.  Then religion or a religion equivalent.I played one game thru and  can say as BTE stands now, the only thing it made me want to do was reinstall Civ 5...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Feels like a cash grab tbh. Not worth $50 at all IMO. Plain and simple, the game is boring.-No matchmaking or anything so you have to play against AI which really isn't that well done. I'm not sure what the devs really expected here... I can't see anyone playing against the one(?) difficulty AI for all that long. If this game had some sort of matchmaking it might be a bit more replayable but the archaic lobby system doesn't offer much in terms of a PvP experience.-No real attempt to immerse you in the game. Textures, audio, cutscenes, are all average at best. Experience just feels stale and unimportant.-Going back to my first point there's no real campaign and overall there's just a lack of content and things to do. The ""quests"" are all shallow and unfun. You're basically playing the same game over and over again against inadequate AI.-Little bits of innovation here and there that really don't do much to enhance the experience. It's not quite a Civ 5 reskin but what it does try to do doesn't really accomplish anything.-As far as strategy goes there really isn't any. Just a bunch of meaningless choices. They try to make the game seem ""complex"" but if you can see through the abitrary number crunching and superflous tech trees then you realize the game is relatively simple and rigid.Overall just feels like a game that knew it could ride on the name it had already made for itself. Clearly the devs weren't very interested in making this title and it showed. Really just a lack of effort IMO. The game isn't completely terrible but it really isn't worth the $50 and you can find much better games for much less. Save your money, this game isn't anything special, and that's probably being generous.			",16,2,0,5,0,0,6

												Rather disappointed, but I did let my expectations get too high. Just played a game with Vostok (medium) difficulty .Pros:- I rather like the unit system. Upgrading the units with affinity levels creates immersion. With a little bit more love it would be great addition.- Quests and victory conditions are a good innovation. I like the way you progress through them in several steps.- Strategic resources. I find the affinity related resources a good idea. Creates some strategic levels for the game.- Wildlife feels immersive.- Affinities. Although the factions are bland, the affinities are not.Cons:- Game is short. Just finished the first one in 10 hours. Thats bad for a civ game.- Wildlife is too weak. By midgame you just overrun them with no consequences attached. Don't know if this one scales up by difficulty levels.- The AI doesn't seem to mind you winning the game. It would be great if by the time you start progressing in the victory conditions, the AI would react in some way. This feels like a lost opportunity to create more content to this game. Perhaps something that was cut off to make the deadline?- There is no city specialization. Not even on the level of Civ V. You just build everything everywhere. This makes for a bad strategy game.- Contact victory seems to be too easy.Grade for the current state game with the pricetag of 50 euros observed: 7-I had a nice (second) game of Warlock 2 going on, which I plan to return to. CIV: BE can wait for the huge content patch or DLC. And I will be very wary of paying the full price for that. The DLC content notes will be read with a magnifying glass and I will still wait for the early adopters to rate it.			",66,44,2,49,27,4,60

												I never write reviews. (except to give praise to the geniuses that make some awesome mods)But to say I feel ripped off by this new Civ game is an understatement. It feels more like an expansion for Civ 5 rather than a new game. It's unbalanced, incomplete, and I find myself actually going back and playing Civ 5 more just to feel like I'm actually trying to play an actual game and not test a beta that I paid 50 smackers for.Would I recommend this game to anyone?

												Ive tried, I really have but this is by far the worse Civilation that have ever been realeasedIt lacks in Graphics, Gameplay and replayability.GraphicsThat Graphhic in this game while being good are impemented in the strangest way possible. The maps are way to busy and  look terrible when compared to CIV V. The way the research tree was designed makes it very difficult to understand what does what in terms of building, Improvment & affinty the colors are so similar that i can never tell what unlocks what. Also back to the map the boarder lines of the city are just plan ugly.GameplayThe AI might as well not exist. In 30+ hours of playing I have never once been attacked or invaded by an enemy AI on any difficulty. The aleins are just more stupid barbarian with one super unit that could be a problem but rarely is. I always end up having  a corner of the map to myself that no one bothers me in.ReplayabilityAlmost every civ plays basicly the same and there is almost no point to trying out other civs			",71,20,0,16,29,0,30

												As it is now I cannot recommend it. After playing the game for about 11 hours I grew tired of a Covert Ops bug (where you cannot redeploy your agents, and this is a known bug since October and hasn't been fixed up to now.) There is also a lot of unneeded micromanagement that is simply driving me crazy. Having to reassign my trade routes (to the same route they were already doing even..) every so many turns and that for every single trade route. Also having to redeploy my satellites to the same positions every so many turns. And having to build the same type of buildings in every city every time and time again.The game is really lacking some proper macro management tools like:-Auto redeploy trade route check mark.-Queues for city builds (set up your own preferred queues and let the city follow one of your setups) or even a mayor who can auto build the things for you.-An option do auto replace a satellite when the old one comes down or even some option to relift it higher in orbit at a cost.-An option for your workers to upgrade all your roads. (Instead of having to do that manually.)I'm also missing some chances they had to make it more fun, perhaps some real terraforming where you can change the actual terrain, lower it, raise it and so on.Basically the game is a lot of fun, but it could be so much better, but with all the unneeded micromanagement there is now it's simply not my type of game. I will probably pick it up again though after a few patches and perhaps some dlcs if those bring the game to a more complete package like civilization.			",1746,776,72,220,247,14,327

												Disappointment.. .. .. .. ..  Has already been said, and I second this, but Civilization Beyond Earth is basically 'an extension of/to Civ V. . . .  Civ Beyond Earth could have easily been a simple $20 MOD to patch Civ V!  Why is it so tough to find corrective patches to the gameplay of Civ Beyond Earth......  Having purchased and downloaded the game through STEAM, I am not sure that the issues I am having are related to missing input through the online download - as apposed to having a physical PC CD copy. . . . . . . .  Every time I have run and attempted to play Civ Beyond Earth ((Which has completely ruined any excitement I once had to play it)) the land masses are spattered in a rainbow-like pattern as if it were meant to be looked upon with 3D glasses....  Another hindrance in playing the game for more than 2 friggin' turns is that all of the sudden the 'Next Turn' button does not work.... Click - Click - Click - CLICK of the mouse button to function THAT option. . . . . . . .  Have to turn the game off and re-run it for it to work........  But this continuously happens...  And I cannot find a patch for these issues!!  As for Civ Beyond Earth, If somehow I am able to play it for more than 2turns the only enjoyment I expect to glean from this is my own Sci-Fi minded personality which will allow me to find other enjoyments of this game beyond its dated game play!  There is nothing futuristic about this game, isn't it 2014/15.......  There are games like WOW or even Call of Duty which depict fantasy worlds and are FAR MORE Graphically detailed; isn’t that the point of PC gaming that there are more components to assist with and providing in delivering an Avatar world like landmasses…????!!!  Civ Beyond Earth is very Cartoon-like, and maybe I feel this way because of my current rainbow-3D like lands, what is this a 5bit game – Nintendo gaming provided a more well-thought out detailed graphics experience than this current Civ game!I have always felt it would be cool if from Civilization V, that once a player reached modern times in the gameplay that the Civ world would be invaded by Aliens that each country would have to thwart off the alien foes ~ or something to that affect.   I mean, the intro to Civ Beyond Earth makes you believe that you start out on Earth in a depleted state, as to the reason for humans needing/wanting to leave Earth…  I thought that you would get to choose where in the galaxy, you the player, would be able to determine where to explore.  So, you start the game already on some planet….  Have played the Civilization Games for years now…  Anticipated THIS game and it was a fail.  Tres disappointed!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,2

												Civ 5 - 236 hours played on steam (probably more like 300 if including off-line play)Civ BE - 33 hours (been 4 weeks since I last played it.)It's not a terrible game on its own, but after playing Civ 5 w/ all their factions, special units and buildings and unique faction perks it honestly kind of feels like im playing a civ game made for a cell phone. I loved this game when it came out... I played it for probably 20 hours in the first week alone, but for me, the replayability of the game was just not there. (one of the greatest achievements of civ5 imo)There are no factions like in civ 5... just starting perks you can choose.There are no special units that only you can get because of your chosen starting perks... Every player can get EVERY unit w/ the required research and resources. There are the 3 branches of tech which kind of makes the appearance of race/faction... but I think this system is just a few steps down from Civ 5.There is alien life!!! But they are simply barbarians ie: unintelligent cattle with chitinous armor, sharp teeth and the occasional acid spitter.There is no challenge!!! Even with the difficulty on higher diff's it is extremely easy to maintain peaceful relations with every other NPC faction on the planet for the duration of the entire game.I could go on, but its basically a list of things I would have wanted to see or things done differently.My bottom line is: It just gets boring really quick, and after a handful of games (33 hours played), I find little reason to launch the game again, which in my opinion is the polar opposite of the last couple civ games (sorry didn't play very much of the earlier civs so I can't comment on those)The next time I feel an urge to play a civ game, I will probably be launching Civ 5 rather than Civ BE. It's not that Civ BE is a horrible game, It just doesn't come close to being as good as Civ 5, which to me was a huge letdown.			",319,56,3,83,37,4,72

												So I'm 7 hours in and I can already tell you what this game is worth to me. Honestly I really don't want to say this but a lot of those who said that this should be a paid scenario for Civ 5 are 100% correct. This game is essentially just a reskinned civ 5 with a few added gimmicks (tech web doesn't count, all thats changed on that front is its no longer a linear path from left to right) and some minor changes here and there.So lets begin with my first irk, the factions. Normally in a civ game you'd have all the historical factions from every era like the Romans, French, Vikings etc with their own unique bonuses, units and city layouts. Well that's certainly not the case here with Civ Beyond earth. For example you have the Slavic Federation and the ARC (American Reclamation Corporation), now you'd expect the buildings and units to look like futuristic Russians and Americans right?, well you'd be entirely wrong there. All units are exactly the same with no visual difference (even the special upgraded units are the same for each faction) or stat changes from start to finish, making the experience of choosing a faction completely pointless as they are exactly the same.What makes this even worse is that during the custom game set up screen you are literally given the faction logo and a paragraph of text to help you decide the faction you want to play as, but seeing as they're all the same anyway there isn't any point in deciding a faction beyond choosing the one with the name that you like.The only true addition to this game is the affinity system with its three selections to choose from. The latter being Harmony which allows you to acquire alien units, Supremacy which turns you into a robotic cyborg race and Purity which gives the middle finger to everything non human. This is where all the visual changes take place and the higher you go up an affinity the more your faction changes, but that is also pointless as all the factions are the same anyway and will always have the same units as you meaning choosing an affinity is purely a cosmetic choice.The aliens themselves do add a bit more of a challenge as opposed to the barbarians of old, being more of a mini faction that you have to deal with and will become stronger the more you play. But even they are just as easily dealt with just like the barbarians as you can simply put up force field barriers that repel all aliens, regardless of strength, from as early as turn freakin 50. One of the most reported strongest aliens during the early game stage, the seige worm, was easily dealt with as I simply put up barriers in all of my cities and had them shoot at the worm until it was dead, and all it did was move back and forth trying to get to my units just behind the force field, making what I thought was a terrifying enemy into more of a simple pest that is just as easily swatted away as the barbarians.Honestly I could go on but right now I'm too tired from all the bland dullness that this game is emanating so I'll just wrap this up with a final verdict. Don't buy this and just stick with Civ 5, wait for mods to come out and for the price to drop before even thinking of buying this. Whilst it's not a game that's on par with horrible games like Big Rigs or Air Control, it's so incredibily dull and bland that you'd be better off playing those games instead, just so you don't end up falling asleep after only 200 turns.So with all that the final score is:5/10Come back in a month or two when all them smart modders make this game worth £30P.s Might write a full review once I play a bit more (god help me on that one) and post it on youtube so this score isn't final for me.

												3/5If you have not played Civ V yet go and play that game instead since it is much more value for money at this point and the gameplay is deeper and more satisfying. Maybe in one or two years Civ: BE will have been patched with enough content, presentation and variety to be something else than a bare TC mod for Civ V.It is a good game but not worth 50€ as it is now. Only buy if you have played Civ V and want something similar with a slight sci-fi twist.			",661,192,14,82,63,6,97

												As has been stated by many others: This game is NOT the spirtual succesor to Alpha Centaruai. It's basically a mega mod for Civ V.Had this been a $25-30 title and advertised as a modified Civ V then I wouldn't feel so robbed by it. As it stands I'm just really, really disapointed.I see a lot of people hoping that this game might get better with future expansion packs but I have my doubts. The core game is a stripped down Civ V experience. In order to make this game stand on it's own they would need to introduce some very unique game mechanics to capture the feeling of taming an alien planet. One would think said mechanics would be in the launch title, right? So if they didn't bother with getting creative at launch why would they get creative down the road with an expansion? Let's face facts, any expansions this game gets are going to be modified versions of GK and BNW.At this point I'm wondering if Firaxis does not have the capability to give us a successor to Alpha Centauri. You could feel the passion the devs had for AC with each game you played. But this game? This game right here is completly devoid of passion. The world leaders are lifeless and generic. The aliens are Starship Trooper knock offs. And the wonders! Seriously what is with the wonders? In Alpha Centauri you were treated to a full FMV with an epic and long quote from one of the faction leaders. Here? You get a picture of a bland blueprint and a sentence from the same VA that's been reading all the other quotes in the game. Prime example of the total lack of passion and life in this game.Trying to cash in on the demand for the next Alpha Centauri experience was a pretty low blow from Firaxis. Unless future expansions are simply mind blowing I think I'm done with this one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you come in with an expectation of a game at least as deep as Civ V you will be disapointed. The game needs work ... more work than the Civ V needed when it was released.The quests are a cool idea, the units models are nice and epic but ....... it has almost no depth, parts seem overpowered (trade routes - you feel like playing as Venice) while others seem pointless (favors - you get them for big chunks of strategic resources and AI will give you a bit of energy in return). Affinities are underdeveloped and underwhelming, your allegiance makes no difference other than other affinity AIs sending you awkward messages, UI is horrendous to the point of obstructing important information, extremely plain and ugly on top. The AIs are rather random, asking for favors a turn before attacking you. Automated workers will either ruin you, waste your precious resources or sometimes just get stuck in a cycle of replacing one upgrade with another. Etc etc ... and that's just after a couple of games.I hope I really hope I will rewrite the review after a major patch ... or a couple, it just should be so much better than it is. Civ V became a great game but it took a couple of years, I hope BE will not take that long.			",190,25,0,20,20,1,42

												Underdeveloped, rushed, impossible to recommend. Easily the worst game in the Civ series so far. Nothing seems to be finished or refined. Here's a list of problems:- The factions have no personality whatsoever. The faction leaders are nobodies, I can't even remember their names, much less any interesting quotes. I can't even remember what factions are available, they're that boring and indiscernable.- The buildings, the technologies are filler, they are not carefully thought out.- The ""wonders"" are not really wonders - they barely affect the flow of the game, they are uninspiring, and when they are built the screen is just stupid and ugly.- The affinities are cosmetic, make no difference to how you play your game.- Same goes for terrain improvements and orbital units.- The aliens are not ""challenging"", they're just ""cheap""- Trade: Once you create many trade routes.... it becomes a hassle to recreate them, so I end up just deleting them- There's not even a proper ending! When you win the game, you literally get a ""victory screen"" and that's that. No statistics, no nothingThis game is so underdeveloped it is a huge shame, coming after the immense success that was Brave New World, this is a huge, depressing step backwards for the series and not at all recommended.

												I got this off of Humble Bundle for $13. I'd gladly pay $13 again for this game. I wouldn't pay full price, though. That said I didn't pay full price for Civ V either. I got it all for less than $7.Is it fun? I think so. It feels a bit more dynamic. The unit upgrade system is pretty neat. The satellite system and alien NPCs are interesting. There's a tech web instead of a tech tree. Culture is pretty much the same, but it has extra bonuses that encourages branching.The only gripe I have about this game is that the leaders and nations aren't instantly recognizeable like they were in Civ V. Their names are so ""futuristic"" that I can't hardly keep track. I was tempted to capture cities just to name them New France, New India, etc. I might come back and update this later, but if I don't rest assured that I am satisfied with my purchase. I'd say this game is definitely worth as much as 13 Arizona teas.			",79,7,0,6,16,0,5

												While it had potential, this game fell short of expectations.  To sum it up-aliens are either a good time waster or a death sentence. They essentially act like barbarians in CIV V, so really they feel like a cheap reskin. The only difference is that they now kill workers instead of capturing them, which means no rescue missions and more risky early expansions. which brings me to my next point-Takes forever to make the most basic tile improvements, and there isn't even any good tech or wonders to speed things up. If you lose your workers to aliens or miasma, well it can be difficult to replace-the miasma mechanic, while intresting, is in my opinion a little backwards. Miasma limits overall growth and the technology to get rid of it is pretty high up.-All these factors severly limit growth. It honestly feels like the game mechanics have been made to limit how fast people can expand to make the game feel ""bigger"" than it actually is, -Most maps are generally smaller than their CIV V counterparts, they only feel big because it takes forever to grow and expand your empire.-You only will honestly use like 4 units in your army, of which will generally be infantry, artillary, tanks, and maybe some aircraft. Generally the game feels bland on account of this. The only upside is that when you can tailor the specs (only once) of said units to fit your playstyle and any following units of the same variety will share similar stats. This game be good or bad depending on the circumstances and the AIs playstyle.-resources have been reworked, and while each provide ertain bonuses some will lower your ""happiness"". This does include some strategic resources, such as oil. The main faction resources which are used to more advanced units however are left alone. They however are fairly rare considering how important they are, and maps can determine your affinity rather than you, which is kinda a buzz kill.-production, food, energy, and other tile bonuses increases are late game tech, and are generally pretty time comsuming and resource intensive. -The CIV BE AIs are all most likely related to Ghandi in some way. It generally feels like the AI is dumber than CIV V and far too aggresive. There isnt even that much insentive to make allies in the game. The small maps cut down on travel time, allies are generally unreliable or too aggresive, and resources are somewhat limited and without fair trade your only real option is to take it by force. -Even if you fight, it honestly seems too easy, and the AI unit spams are so laughably weak it's pathetic. There is no strategy, and the game mostly taxes you rather than buff the AIs on higher difficulties. A good killzon will murder any army of theirs and this only gets worse when you get better artillary or orbital cannons.-the victory conditions are kind of..dark..in my opinion. In CIV V you could win the game by uniting humanity thorugh cultural domination and skillfull diplomacy, martial prowess and empire building, or expanding upon the stars as a paragon of science and prosperity. In CIV BE each affinity gets its own victory conditions and you either go full on Borg and invade earth to assimilate everyone (supremacy), stick tentacles in unsavory places and become a giant hivemind blob (Harmony). or copy that movie avatar and kill off all the aliens how earth can repoulate on the new world (purity). It really doesn't feel like your forging your own destiny like you did in CIV V, and this really cuts down on the rollplaying and immersion. You cannot be the enviromentally friendly borg, the non racist starfleet, or the mechanized and technologically advanced Na'vi.-In some cases the affinity system is terrible. Your units will not evolve until a certain threshold is reached within your given affinity. This means you can't research multiple affinities for their bonuses no matter how important they are to your playstyle as this will ultimately mean you WILL be out teched even if you have beter and more technologies than your enemies. I've had a game where I went heavy eco/science and still had tier one marines even though i could spam ubers.-the UI is cheaply made and poorly optimized, and don't get me started on the tech tree. You can’t tell what’s a unit, wonder, or whatever.-said wonders are awefull...hardly worth the time to build.-racials are useless unless HEAVILY modded. vanilla races hardly matter, and there are no unique units or strategies you can really employ. The only saving grace for this game is STEAMs wonderful mod community, who has more common sense and talent than a team of professional game designers; seriously they could have built on CiV 5 but no. They even had the lore friendly setting of the space race victory, imagine if you could import saves from Civ 5 to BE and play as you country in SPAHSE.But now...you have generic continetal flavoured nations with barely any unique flavours instead. All in all im giving this a (5) on a scale of (10), The game feels far too simplistic and the lore, art, and design are somewhat subpar at best and unoriginal and boring at worst. For its price, i would not recommend it except if it was on sale . It honestly feels more like a dlc to CIV V than its own standalone game. And as for my own opinion, i am highly dissapointed in this game and barely find it fun without the use of mods. It honeslty had great potential but it fell disastrously short of all expectations, even compared to vanilla CIV V. All in all a dark day for Civ players everywhere.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have played the games of Civilization series a lot. So far this is my favourite. It has the certain kind of ""sense of wonder"" and special elements that facinate me: alien worlds, aliens, miasma, relics, affinities ... and with Rising Tide DLC, you can build cities on the water.Sure, it definitely has some oddities: sometimes AI is just strange (in hilarious or in frustrating way - or anything between), occassionally bugs happen or you get stuck because of some unforeseen issue. Despite of those, I find this game highly enjoyable. If you're looking for ""a bit different"" game from basic Civs, this is the one.The eagle has landed. 9.5/10 (with DLCs).			",18,7,0,3,8,0,8

												Didn't try Civilzation V? Buy and play Civ V first, by the time you're done this will be cheaper and therefore worthwhile.Already played Civ V? Get this if you REALLY want to try the Sci-Fi aspects, but you should probably wait for a sale.Everyone always says Civ 5 is only complete with its expansions. Well, I've never tried the expansions and Vanilla Civ V was better than this game, BY FAR. Of course I'm not expecting a storyline to go with this kind of game, but all the personality was ripped from it, leaving behind a robotic shell.Sure, it's a decent game, but it's not up to the quality of its predecessors.

												For those with fond memories of Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri, this is...not the game for you. Even though the Rising Tide expansion has improved the game a bit, it is still at its core not fun to play.It's hard to pin down exactly what makes the game so bland and unfun, but it really comes across as a paint by numbers attempt to remake SMAC with the underwhelming Civ V engine.If you want a re-skin of Civ V set on alien planets, have at it. You could probably get something better, free as a mod.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												With DLCs, Beyond Earth is definitely worth playing although it didn't keep me motivated to play as long as Civ V did, as both planets and factions are not as interesting as they could be. It feels more like an expansion to Civ V as the gameplay is almost similar, but there are some special elements which give the game an individual touch, such as unique units depending on your science development, interesting spy management and quests in which you can take decisions. While the developers said that in retrospective they wish they had been a little more creative and not been so stuck to Civ V, I think it would have been nice to see some elements of Beyond Earth being used in Civ VI (check my negative review on it).To make it short: Beyond Earth is not as much fun as Civ V as all in all it feels somehow smaller and you will have seen everything much faster than in the ""big"" Civ games. As I wrote, it feels like an expansion. But after hundreds of hours spent on Civ V, Beyond Earth is a nice addition to the franchise you can have fun with, if you don't expect too much.

												This is a fun game. It has a cool sci-fi theme. There are Aliens, neat units, strange resources, not the standard factions, cool graphics and more. Dunno why so many have Hated on this game, it is pretty good.Affinities are researched and give unit upgrades. All the unit types thta get the upgrade are instantly upgraded so no paying for them to upgrade or searching the map for them. The upgrades are really neat, as well.Buildings usually get a quest decision where the played chooses one of two upgrades for the building. I though this was really neat.Culture points provide virtues which are minor bonuses in several areas. Of course there is Technology. The tech 'tree' is a non-linear web. Yup, non-linear, which I found interesting.However, the game still suffers from the problem that all cities can build almost all structures, just like in Civ I-V. Civ VI has fixed this, but oh well.Beyond Earth is not a bad game and is fun.			",36,24,0,42,19,0,59

												I am passionate about turn-based strategies like civilization, master of orion and galactic civilization series. I spent hundreds hours playing all of them. If you have similar taste - DO NOT BUY this game. It is not ready.Civilization BE is more like civilization 5 DLC, not standalone game. It looks like Firaxis/Sid cheated on you changing planet texture and research tree (stealing idea from endless space, huh?). They added satellite units, outposts, miasma and changed tech tree but, in general, it is civilization 5 with renamed unit/buildings and completely same mechanic. And, frankly, they cut off many nice things civlization 5 has, probably, to sell them as an additional content.I also personally expected new, modern Alpha Centaura. People who played original game would understand me. But it's not Alpha Centaura. You don't have terraforming or underwater cities here. There is no prototyping. No aliens race. Many things that stuck in my mind for years from my childhood are missed here. Pros:+ new civilization look&feelCons:- cut version of civilization- not even close to original Alpha Centaura- unjustified very expensiveIf you didn't play civilization 5 you might like BE. If you don't see original Alpha Centaura you won't probably miss it. But if you have a choice what to buy civilization 5 or civilization BE - grab civ5, it's much better now. I don't say here that BE is a bad game, no. I say that this game is not ready, it requres a lot of DLCs and your money, of course, to make it a civilization 5 level. There are many good games I can play and wait for years until they release all DLCs, make complete pack and push it with a good discount. Save your time and money and enjoy playing cool games!Thank you for reading,VPSnake			",134,19,1,25,16,0,12

												You might as well buy Civ V and all of it's expansions whenever a Steam sale is going on.  This is just lipstick on a pig and it feels like an uncompleted game while playing.  I get the impression that this was treated in the same manner Sims 4 was, in that the developers and/or publishers felt that they could leave out features specifically to ramp up DLC sales (whenever they begin to occur).And not that this will be a big deal to many, but the game is extremely unfriendly to the colorblind.

												NEGATIVES:This does not look like an AAA game that I paid $50 for. Firaxis apparently didn't learn a damn thing from their vanilla Civ V launch or listen to any complaints about the issues in G&K/BNW.The AI feels barely functional just like Civ V vanilla's release.Firaxis showed phenomenal ability to make their own idea as terrible a possible - if with CivV you had to deal with 5 or so TR now you have 3 per city, you have to manually reassign EACH an EVERY of them; why is there no 'automatically continue this trade route' option?!Diplomacy somehow managed to become even worse than in CivV, which is achievement on its own.The AI looks to be completely unchanged from Vanilla Civ V, despite the glaring deficiencies that AI had. Much of the text in the game is carried over verbatim from Civ V, such as diplomacy and alien alerts, with just words like ""gold"" substituted for their BE equivalent. Voice acting is extremely limited; take for example the AI condemning you. Now, I can understand that Civ V didn't have voice acting for that at release, since it wasn't in the game. But BE has no excuse. Or how about the tech quotes from the various leaders? SMAC had them voiced by the actual faction leaders, which helped flesh out their personality, but instead it's just the same base voice.  Virtues, like quests, seem mostly to be free bonuses you get to choose every few turns more to disguise the fact that you aren't doing anything else but click 'end turn' and movement orders than to actually progress the game.Half of the wonders in the game are totally useless and they wouldn't even be good if you would double their yield. And trade routes are so good that nothing else in the game really matters. if you would half their yield they would still be op. So i really have to asked: how can this be released in that state?POSITIVES:I really do like the new feel, and I can see the huge potential that this game could have, especially with the orbital layer.Tech web is cool, great for having a more varied approach to the game.  OVERALL:I'll play BE again, a bit here and there, mostly waiting to see what the mod community is able to do with it. But right now I have a tough time recommending it when BNW is still doing brisk business.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was hoping to get blown away, but it plays mostly like vanilla CIV5 before Brave New World and feels woefully uninspired and unoriginal overall... so it's basically a re-skin for CIV5 DLC with a lot of the features removed and with worse graphics than CIV5. AI, diplomacy, city management, unit management and function, among other things, are nearly identical, which would not be so terrible if CIV5’s weak points were not copied to a dot as well (yes, including the broken/cheating AI). The unit customization we were promised is almost comical. Landscape is repetitive. The different factions are virtually identical to each other. Aliens are boring and pretty much pointless except as hindrance at the beginning of the game before you get better tech. City states are just trade posts now with essentially no function and are 99% irrelevant to the gameplay. They did rework espionage nicely though and the orbital units/layer are nice, but not very varied. They could have done a lot more with it! UI is not great... They should have taken some cues from games by Amplitude Studios when it comes to that… it doesn’t feel like it belongs in 2014 at all. Also what's up with end game? The screen tells me that I won or lost and I’m back at the main menu. No recap, no score breakdown, no map, no ranking, not even a reason WHY I won or lost... It is at least relatively stable and free of any major bugs based on my experience. Some small bugs and one crash so far after ~14 hours of play. Others have not had such luck however from what I've read?Having already played games like Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri, Pandora First Contact, Endless Space, Galactic Civilizations, Sins of a Solar Empire, and Endless Legend I was really hoping for a lot more (they were not exactly pioneering the genre here), especially with all the hype and promises. Being a huge fan of the Civilization games and CIV5 I was immensely excited for this game and even pre-purchased it, which I have never done before for any game… and whew! What a letdown. Really tried loving the game, but I just can’t force myself do it. I like it enough, it’s a good start, but it’s entirely unfinished. Would rather just play CIV5 or fire something up by Paradox Interactive. EU4 here I come! BE, sorry, but you were a waste of money. Should have waited for the 75% off sale. It needs the equivalent of what Gods & Kings and Brave New World did to CIV5 ASAP. Never pre-ordering a CIV game again... haha If you haven't bought it yet then just wait for a Steam sale, or similar.			",61,18,1,17,23,0,19

The AI plays the same as theAI from CIV V Brave new world. In other words it does nothing for the most part.Theres no wonder movies and the health system means you pretty much cant buildmore that two cities without giving up health entirely.

												Do you like Civ 5?  Do you like Alpha Centuri?  Good, then you can skip this game.Beyond Earth is worse than both games in every concievable way.  The UI is exceedingly poor, for example a componant that should be entirely simple to implement like the world map is so tiny and horribly presented that it has been rendered entirely useless.  The information bar at the top of the screen is tiny yet cluttered.  The grid itself is ugly as is the fog of war.  The game itself is just so dark.  It's like being in a room with no windows and the only ligthing coming from an old 30 watt bulb that's been dyed blue (or yellow depending on the map).  What first seemed an interesting twist, the tech web is difficult to navigate and read.  Maybe after you dump 40 hours into the game you'll remember what upgrades are under what leaf and branch, but I grew sick of trying to find where that stupid tech was that let me harvest float stone (or whatever I was looking for at the time).  The game does a really terrible job introducing the new quest mechanics, and at no point did it ever explain victory conditions.Religions and culture trees have congealed into a bland, overly condensed and boring set of 4 cultural trees you can advance down.Leaders/states have no personality, aliens are little more than window dressing for each planet, and jeeze what an ugly planets they are.  Do you like blue on blue on blue?  How about puke yellow worlds with oceans of dirty water?  Then boy does Beyond Earth have some property for you!Beyond Earth has unambiguously poor presentation, and offers nothing mechanically new or interesting over Civ 5, it strips away depth, yet some how it's become more obtuse.  If you're looking to get more out of this current gen of Civ I think you'll be much better served turning to the workshop than spending your money on this poorly designed and ill conceived addition to the franchise.

												First I have to say : This will be a good game....eventually. It is (obviously) very similar to Civ 5, but for me at least they have changed enough that I do not feel ripped off paying full price.I haven't had much time to play, but this game clearly would have greatly benefited from a later release. The Health system is like happiness, but much much worse. There are far fewer sources than Civ 5, and if you want to play a ""sprawling"" colony your going to be VERY limited on how large you can make those settlements.The amound of space between players is just sad. I would have expected alot of exploration but players are just too close. They exploration phase is pretty fun, but it is sooooo short. It just seems players are much closer together than they were in Civ 5.The balance between the virtues (social policies) and affinities (idealogies) could use more alot work.And finally there is just an overall lack of polish in the game. The splash screens before the intro? No sound.The ""click to accept"" screen before the game? No graphics. Just text on a black backround.You completed production in one of your cities? Great, but what exactly finished building?I could go on for pages, but honestly, why bother? I'm sure they will fix all these little issues eventually. But right now the game is so unpolished it feels like a late beta, and not a final release.			",27,6,0,25,17,0,33

												Well I have been a Civ addict since civ2.I consider the Civ series and old Westwood C&C and Read alert the best games ever.But Civ Beyond Earth is not worthy to be in the Civilization saga.The only positive thing with the game is the mantle support, it runs great on my 4790k and 290x.On the negative side, I have so many things...- The techtree is a disaster(sphere design), no clear path and wonders not highlighted.- Speaking of wonders, there are very few of them, and the profit of building them is unclear.- No bomplans, and there is only 1 flying unit and it suck against infantry,armour and cities, poor range also- No nukes or missiles, wtf!- No submarines or Aegis cruisers. There are two types of boats, carrier and ""Battleship""- No airports, so you can't airlift units around- No world congress.In all this is a turn based strategy game in space, with good graphics.But It is not a true civ game and everyone should stay with Civ 4 and Civ 5, no need to ""upgrade""			",70,3,1,8,10,0,26

												Civ:BE is a very similar experience to Civ 5, adding very little to better the series and missing many opportunities. I don't think the game is terrible, but it's definitely sub-par in my opinion. The base game is good, but the current content is underwhelming and bland. I will briefly go over all of the new features and changes to the game that improved the experience, and those that hampered it.The Good--------------[Web Tech Tree] Giving players more freedom in their technology choices creates for a much more open experience. The 'late game' technologies are just a few nodes away if a player chooses to go straight (usually not a good idea though). Civ V's linear tech tree was ok, but your options were severely limited and you often ended up with a similiar path each game.[Espionage] Spying is actually interesting now. Whereas in Civ 5 the espionage system was just a fire and forget kind of system, the new spy system feels much more involved, allowing you to have a lot more control over what you do - from siphoning energy (money) from the enemy capitol or potential overthrowing the city and claiming it for your own. Yes, you can steal cities. I've done so in the past by rushing the technology with the Russian's free tech bonus and it is hilarious.[Satellites] Not a real complex system, just a nice little addition to the game. Basically you place a stationary unit that affect a grid of tiles under it for X amount of turns.[Expeditions] Right away your Explorer unit can dig up artifacts from satellites and other things much like an archaeologist from Civ V. This adds a neat extra thing to do early game.The Bad --------------[Technological Progression] The tech tree might have improved its layout, but as a player I felt very detached from the world. I don't even know what I'm researching 90% of the time. What the hell is Alien Ethics? What kind of upgrades can I expect from something like Field Theory or Transcendental Math? Why do I need to research Physics and Engineering? I mean it's so far in the future, shouldn't I already have a really good grasp over those? As I get more and more research, I don't feel any progression. In Civ V it was VERY obvious, as your people went from cavemen to a more civilized and culture people ... but in Beyond Earth it feels so cold and lifeless, nothing I do has any real visual impact on my faction.[Quests/Decisions] A new system which allows you to make small decisions throughout the game. Do you want +1 Food, or +1 Energy? +5 unit healing or +1 Science and Energy? As well as things like ""Be nice to the bugs, or eradicate them (affects affinities)"". These are soon forgotten and very inconsequential. By the time you reach the end of the game, you'll have more or less forgotten about your choices as they have such an incredibly low impact on the game. This system is good conceptually but was executed in a very boring way.[Wonders] Unexciting and bland. Even the ""you completed the wonder"" message is lame, unlike Civ V where it felt like a huge accomplishment, wonders in BE are just a major let down. There also seems to be a serious lack of variety with them, but maybe that's just me.[Factions] Not only are the wonders boring in this game, so are the leaders, factions, the sponsors, the affinities. Every aspect of customization is boring as hell. The only thing that separates each faction is a single bonus and a color scheme. All of the choices you make when you start the game (and there aren't many choices, to be honest) are unexciting. Do you want to start with a worker, or a soldier, or maybe you want pioneering for free? Civ 5 offered a couple of unique units/buildings/tile improvements and a few unique abilities that would really set each race apart - but everything feels so samey now. I often forget what faction I picked in Civ BE... that was never the case in Civ 5, where I was constantly reminded of what civilization I chose.[Religion] No religion? They could have at least added something in its place, like politics or some kind of alien cult-worshiping stuff. Religion was one of my favorite aspects of Civ V and BE feels like it's missing a huge chunk of variety because it's gone.[City States] Their new version of city states are just a building that you can do a trade route with. Basically the same thing except they don't offer quests. [Affinities] You level them up linearly from 0 to 13, you occasionally pick some unit upgrades, and there's a few bonuses like ""Aliens won't attack your Explorer"" and ""Units take less damage from miasma."" The unique units even feel pretty similar across all 3 affinities. I was really hoping there'd be like an additional social-policy/tech-tree thing to choose how to customize how the affinities affect my faction, but that's not the case. The Affinities don't add much to the experience.[World Variety] This is one of the most lack-luster elements of the game. There's virtually NO variety for planets in this game. I've played most of the way through 5 games so far and started about a dozen different new maps and I must say every planet looks really similar. I was hoping for some crazy randomization, both visually and mechanically, but instead I got a bunch of boring Earth-like planets. Where's the color? I want some planets with bright, deep color palettes. I want to see worlds with extreme weather like lightning and sandstorms, planets with no oxygen, more variety for wild life. Why is every indigenous alien bug species exactly the same for all worlds? I guess every single planet other than earth is inhabited by a race of mostly-passive gigantic green bugs.[Neutral Aliens] They do nothing, usually. Even if I attack them every turn for a long time they don't get mad at me (I've played on both Apollo (8) and Gemini (6) difficulty so far). Then there's the siege worm which is just a minor nuisance that is unkillable until much later into the game, kind of like a natural disaster. I don't think it adds anything to my experience, it's just stupid. There's also ZERO variety in aliens, as I've mentioned above in world variety. Everything is a stereotypical ""bug race"".[Computer's AI] The AI is completely brain-dead. Even on Apollo difficulty, which apparently just makes them cheat, the AI does nothing to thwart my efforts. With just a small army of infantry/rangers/artillery supported by a couple of mid-game units I can wipe out all of the AI with ease. They will ask me ""please I beg of you, give me this resource things aren't going so well"", and when I try to accept they angrily decline and say ""I MUST ASK FOR MORE"". That's like I asked you for a cookie, and when you tried to say ""Sure"" I was insulted that you were offering me only a cookie and not milk also. The only way to make Civ:BE a challenging single player experience is to give yourself a major disadvantage by modding the game or purposely stacking the odds against you.[Micro-Management] Automation AI is still terrible. It will constantly make bad decisions when prioritizing tiles, so you gotta manually pick each tile yourself if you wanna be effective. What's worse is that the game stops notifying you about a new citizen after the 5th one per city. Why is there no option to turn that back on? Also they've done nothing to add more depth to the game since Civ 5. It's the same old ""allocate citizens to tiles, choose production"" route. I was really hoping they'd get more creative with what you can do but maybe they were worried it would confuse new players?The Ugly--------------The game will rely on DLC to feel complete.Since I know the game will be another DLC/Expansion-pack circle-jerk, I cannot with a good conscience recommend this game to anyone but hardcore Civ-Fans. I don't think I wasted my money, but I am definitely disappointed. I'll probably continue to play the game until I'm sick of it, but I just wish they did a better job.Rating: C			",41,5,0,3,10,1,9

												A competent entry in the Civ franchise but dissapointing overallThis really feels like a mediocre expansion to Civ 5. Despite taking place on a bizarre alien world, the setting feels quite lifeless and dull. The leaders and factions have zero personality. The quotes (that might give some insight into their personalities) are bland and generic and all voiced by the same actor. It's like they took everything that was so flavourful and unique about Alpha Centauri and turned it on its head. Other than this, the engine is almost identical to civ 5, albeit less polished and balanced. The affinities are an interesting innovation. The AI presented very little challenge (I was able to win my very first game on the 2nd hardest difficulty without much difficulty). The tech tree is diverse and seems to be based on 'Endless Space' to a large extent. However, it's quite hard to learn what each tech does since they all have baffling (albeit generic) sci-tech names like 'gene harmonics' and 'alien splicing'. Again, unlike previous Civ installments the tech advancements provide very little colour to the world. There isn't much else to say about this game really. If it was a free fan-made mod for Civ 5 I would call it 'impressive'. However, considering how expensive it is it's hard not to feel dissapointed and a bit ripped off. Perhaps I'm holding it to a higher standard than most games since it's part of the Civ franchise but I don't think that's unreasonable. This will be the last time I pre-order from Firaxis and if you haven't ordered yet I recommend you wait till it's on sale before throwing away your money!			",17,7,0,16,4,2,21

												(TL;DR)Pros: Affinity, Satellites, and AI (seems a bit better)Cons: Looks, Plays, and feels like a modded copy of Civ5 (not entirely bad, but not worth full price)First off I would like to say that this game is addicting, fun, and all around a good game. That being said, I hate to be the first one on here to admit it, the game honestly feels like a slimmed down version of Civ5. Now if you don't have Civ5, by all means buy this, you will be telling yourself ""one more turn"" for the next 8-10 hours. However, as we have seen with games like BF Hardline it has become popular with companies to release games that seem like expansion packs for full price as individual games. Beyond Earth feels like one of these games as you could easily replace the barbarians in civ5 with the aliens, swap out the color pallettes on the maps, and increment the technologies more while putting them in a new format. While many things have changed in small ways, some key components of the previous game are missing such as religion, artistic backdrops (for the NPCs), or any sense of story or meaning in the world to separate it from being ""Alien planet game #252"". On the plus side the Affinities and satellites are both welcome features, however, I can't help but thinking that for $50 there could be more or at least more deviation from the previous title.

												The game is much better now with DLC and updates. Offers more things to do and tighter gameplay. Still, it's not good enough to suggest to anyone but fanatics of 4X who played them all and want a small dose of something new. Here's some of the stuff I like: decisions, new ways of diplomacy (arguable though), artifacts.Beyong Earth is not a bad game by any means, but extremely overpriced and lacking developer's attention. It's not nearly as polished as Civilization V or Civilization VI. Cutscenes are cheaper. Most of the graphics, be it units or landscape tiles, are not interesting. In a good Civilization game each element is like a small cute cookie you want to eat or like a badge that you want to wear. Research tree is messy, has too much stuff going on and doesn't give enough feeling of the progress. Aliens angle could be done much better, for now they feel like some kind of resource, not a part of survival formula. Espionage, unit modifications and the satellite layer all feel like missed opportunities.			",420,129,6,78,39,9,114

												I had very high hopes for this game, but it feels like a lot is missing.  Best points - orbital system is very cool, fungal worlds looks really good.  Good points - one unit per hex similar to panzer general, and of course Civ V, different unit looks between factions.  Bland - leaders are all the same in diplomacy.  Bad - affinity level has huge affect on units, I think this was just a poor design decision so save complexity (say versus the actual technologies selected having a direct affect on units, regardless of affinity... I think scrapping the idea of affinity would have forced a more complex game, but adding it in made it easier for the development.  Also bad, trade routs... wtf why did we go from a workable number of routes (in Civ V) to 2-3 PER CITY, its ridiculous, and managing that many is boring at best and annoying at least.  More bad - AI is really stupid.  Several times I've seen the AI leave a low heath unit right next to my counter-unit for an easy kill... or an enemy ranged unit sits right next to my armor (akin to archer moving next to enemy cavalry) DUH... they have no sense of tactics at all.  More bad - buildings are uninsipried, and wonders are worse.  Sadly, worst point - immersion is not there.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Wait until the game is finished. The game is nice as such, but there are just some really obvious flaws.Trade routes are ridiculous. In civ5 you could have serious advantages of going for a tall type gameplay with few large cities. This is no longer an option, due to the insane amounts of mfg+food or sci+energy you get from trade routes you just need as many cities as possible. It is not hard to keep up health, which just has to be below 20, even above for a while is fine.I managed to get a size 1 useless tundra city at 60 base mfg, in size 1! I don't see the point to removing the global limit of trade routes and even so, the issue is that the output should be lowered to 1/4th of what it is now.The ais are more useless than ever. It may be partly because they don't know how to abuse the trade routes, but it seems silly that even with all the cheats they get in apollo they are still super easy. They have always been quite bad at the civ5 combat system and you have always been able to win over a large force with a few ranged units luring them out, but now you can easily totally overpower them in everything from science to amount of units or whatever you like at the same time.Since civ1 there has been a linear tech tree that gave you somewhere between 1-8 tech options, usually a lot less than 8. Now you can easily end up having 20+ techs to choose from at one time. I guess this is something you could easily get used to in time and strategies will come up, but what is the point of making it such a grid of messiness? It's just a bit larger than my screen too so I have to move around it on the ""minimap"" to try and get an overview, and I am not really wiser on it after 4 games.Hope these things gets fixed in a patch soon and I really think the game shouldn't have been released like that. Just because you have the ability to easily patch things does not mean you should release half finished stuff, just look at the steam reviews and how fast they are going downwards.

												""1 step forwards 2 steps back"" is the theme in this game. The orbital units and affinity add some additional choice and depth but then the lack of a religion/culture spread system takes that away. Without religion and culture pressing at your borders, you can just coast on through to victory so long as you stay friendly with your neighbours. Diplomacy is very basic, there are no research or production agreements. There are no great people or golden ages, each turn is a lot like the last. This game is crying out for some expansions so until then, I can't fully recommend it.My two biggest dissapointments are: #1 The lack of artwork for wonders. All you get is the usual quote and a basic blueprint style view of the wonder. The artwork in civ5 gave a lot of context to the wonder built and made it seem like a real achievement. There's some great artwork at the begining of the game, I was hoping for even more. Some cool sci-fi artwork would bring the player closer to the world that firaxis has created.#2 Lack of a cinematic or even unique artwork for victories. When you win the game you get a larger view of the artwork used in the victories list. I was really hoping for something new as a reward for winning the game. A full cinematic is not even required, I would be happy with a few cool images with a bit of narration over them.CONCLUSION: No for now, wait until they release an expansion and bundle it with the base game.

												Not quite sure where these 9/10 all came from. This game is a poor excuse for a Civilization game. After playing through it for a good number of rounds, I find myself mostly clicking for trade routes, an AI that is as arbitary as it is stupid and a game which feels incomplete. There is limited stats in game, there are *no* end of game stats and the information that you get presented during the game is a scratch of what you would expect based on previous Civilization games. Firaxis have a lot of work to do to bring this games feature set into something that might resemble a finished product.			",187,18,6,17,27,1,35

												Did you like Alpha Centauri / Alien Crossfire? I'm afraid this game isn't for you. That's all I would have wanted to know, before purchase.Everything that was fun in SMAC: resource gathering, colony creation, secret projects, sci-fi technology, and the over-the-top, memorable faction leaders, have been reworked so that everything is, and everyone are, tedious and uninteresting. After forcing myself to keep playing, I found that the process of combat and the threat of native wildlife are better than they were in SMAC. The game is pretty, and the soundtrack is excellent. But at its core, as many people say, it is not much more than a mod of Civilization 5.This review does not reflect the Rising Tides expansion, but I'm not sure I can find it in me to make that purchase. Maybe some day.			",51,8,0,10,5,0,8

												I have been wanting to put off writeing this review for some time, but i just cant wait for this game to get patched anymore. I would love to give you a review of the units, the factions and what i think needs to be balanced/changed. Saddly that would involve being able to launch the game. Now my system is no sloth in terms of gaming performance, but only once when the stars have alligned have i been able to get past the opening movie to the menu. The ""patch"" released to fix this issue has caused more issues then it fixed. I actually think that this game should be removed from steam, it doesnt work and if the developer thinks that it is acceptible to spend 2 months developing a patch to fix issues only to have it only introduce more issues and reduce the amount of players that can play even more. I'd avoid at all cost's.			",101,18,3,9,8,1,37

												I'm sorry. I did read the negative reviews. Then I played the demo. Then I bought it anyway. I've now played 2 campaigns. This is my first ever review on Steam. It is there to protect people who have a limited budget from wasting a purchase on this. (I have more money than sense)I'm such an idiot. The game is seriously lacking. It has no charm and is beyond pointless. It is little more than a bad DLC for Civ 5. There is lots of stuff in the civilopedia which you basically have no reason to ever read. 1) There are 5 strategic resources and I still have no idea what 2 of them do. 2) There are 6 real units (plus 1 or 2 extras). Basically, marines, tanks, ranged tanks, ranged marines, ship, plane (yes 1 ship. 1 plane - there is a carrier to move your planes around but it does nothing else so it's not really a ship). You don't really ever need tanks AND marines (either/or) so you just need 2 units. Period.3) Units upgrade constantly and  do so because you change affinity level (which it is tricky to consciously control in any satisfying way - think of it like leveling up in an RPG, i.e. you are generally always trying to do it). That means you have no control over strategy because you may have 6 useless units and then the next turn all 6 are suddenly brilliant. 4) But you can't conquer anyway. Because happiness has been replaced with health and is incredibly restrictive over how many cities you or the AI can control at any one time (think 2/3 initially, 5 by mid game, 8/10 by late game if you put a lot of effort in). So in one play through I did 8 players on a 6 player map and 1/4 was still empty by the end (epic speed circa 400 turns).5) But you wouldn't want many cities because every city needs 2 trade convoys and ever 25 turns you have to micro manage both convoys (so most turns in mid game are 'unit needs orders' 'trade convoy' click, click, scroll to find 'previous route' click, click 'yes I'm sure' *repeat* x 20 units is a bit boring)6) I won one and lost one. Losing one everything just stops and you have no warning and had no idea why. Winning one is laborious and boring - construct this 'have I won?' *sigh* 'no' 'construct this next' sort of thing. When you win there is nothing - no cinematic, just a message box.7) There is literally no depth. In Civ 5 I still sometimes sing the jewish faith jingle to the irritation of my wife. I also still quote CEO Morgon on the ethics of greed etc. etc. This game has nothing. No memorable sounds, no music, no wonder videos, no throne room (yes, I'm old). Nothing. Zilch. 8) Aliens, yes there are now basically barbarians with different units (there are 4 land and 2 sea). But luckily once you realise they only attack if you are within attack range of their nest, you can just ignore them, so they are even less of a challenge than barbarians.Mostly you sit inside your borders hording useless resources you will never use, improving your cities in exactly the same way and endlessly refreshing trade convoys until one of the players wins and puts everyone out of their misery. This is a very very bad game. I love turn based strategy, I play hundreds of hours (much to the annoyance of said wife). Unlike the launch of Rome II I don't see how patches will save this. It has no redeeming features.Sorry, but if you have a limited budget then do not buy. If you are like me you'll buy this anyway. I would say ""I told you so"" but really you will have been punished enough.			",143,28,0,60,58,3,108

I'm not eager to really do anything spectacular or use some creativity to unfold my machinations against other AI or see my city unfold to great potentials.I hated the original Civ V vanilla, it was awful, but after many fixes and two expansions later no other Civ game comes close to how great it is. All the design decisions over Civ IV made sense, most of the issues in Civ V like diplomatic and cultural victories were properly fixed and made significantly better. That game has personality, writing your own history with your  own civilization felt great, but Beyond Earth feels so bland.			",56,1,1,1,4,1,7

												I can't say I can reccomend this installment in the Civ franchise. Civ5 is an amazing and addictive experience, this one not so much. It's incomplete. The maps are crowded and boring with half as much resources as play than in the previous Civ. The tech tree, while being new and experimental, is confusing and messy. It just doesnt feel right and you have to mod it just to make it easier to follow. The rivaling civs are boring, it's easy to lose track of who is who because every civ is some boring no-name with some generic corporate acronym they are representing. I see that Firaxis is trying to do something ""realistic""...but it just comes off boring. Also there just isn't much to do in this game...until the expected expansions.This is a problem with games nowadays, shipping incomplete games devoid of polish or satisfying content. The Sims and Civ are the biggest offenders here. Stop selling 45% of a game at full price, dumbasses.  3.5/10			",197,39,3,16,9,2,14

												An empty hollow game. Desgined for a gazzilion DLCs, although there was only one before it was abandoned.Update 8/2/2016:I figured out it has a memory leak that cause the game to eventually crash if you play the same game for too long. At turn 420, I can only move a few units and then it crashes. Reload, move a few more units and it crashes again. This is with the Rising Tide expansion. I thought they would have optimized it better to be able to handle all the extra water cities. I was wrong. All my other games I was able to complete before turn 400. I have graphics set to the lowest and everything I can turned off and still it doesn't help.Update 12/20/16: Thought I'd give it another go. Got as far as turn 560 and now my saved game won't load anymore. The game just crashes. was thinking a fresh install would improve something, anything, but it's still trash.

												Big fan of the Civ series. Played Civ3 Golden Edition for days on end as a kid, and have again with Civ5 BNW.Gonna be honest here, for all the hype this game got, it is really boring. I understand wanting to have a base to start fresh from on a new game, but this is a really poor start.The corporations or whatever they are have zero personality or charisma. So from the beginning you're not that excited about starting a new game, because it really doesn't matter who you are, they all feel exactly the same and have nothing to set them apart from each other.The UI is more futuristic looking, but again not really that aethetically pleasing, and functionality wise, not even close to Civ5 in terms of fluidity.The terrain is actually really annoying to navigate, especially early game...which is the only time you need to navigate it really. The miasma thing is really irritating (-10 HP to unit, basically on every tile), and to be honest so are the aliens. The aliens are basically barbarians except instead of one or two near a camp, there's like 10 of them, and they just slaughter your units early game. Which isn't even that big of a deal, because each explorer can only excavate one site (ancient ruin), but it makes settling new cities early game really frustrating.There is no surprises, you know where everyones capital is the second they 'land' on the planet.The affinity system is interesting, for about 5 minutes. Harmony (get along with aliens) doesn't actually stop the aliens from attacking you, which i thought would be the most interesting point of deviation. Purity (kill aliens) is clearly the best, as its units are the easiest to reach through technologies and the resources needed to get them, and focuses on killing aliens, giving your units an experience/upgrade bonus over other affinities, which is huge becuase they give you a flat 15% damage boost instead of just terrain bonuses or utility.I don't know man, this game was really disappointing, I hope they still produce some civilzation packs and expansions for Civ 5 because this Beyond Earth is light years away from everything you love about Civ. I hope this review stops people from purchasing the game so they go back to producing new civ's to use in Civ5.OHHH. One good thing. The ominous space background music and orbital sound effects are really cool when you're smoking weed, other than that, it's impossible to maintain interest in this game.			",2,0,0,1,0,0,3

												This is quite a disappointment. Not only are several systems less interesting than their equivalents in Civ 5, but the tech tree is confusing and uninteresting, the AI rather weak and the whole game is quite slow.			",564,141,11,75,53,7,110

												This is a game that is easy to see its cracks, but after playing the fantastic Civ 5, I can no longer go back because of Beyond Earth. There are improvements that I've taken for granted. Best place to start is with the aliens. Are they innovative? Well, yes and no. They have a hive mind that has been retold countless of times since Ender's Game. But there is some sort of quasi-significant AI in there. They aren't just barbarians, spewing forth from camps to raid your villages over and over. You can be at peace with them. You can also bond with them, creating alien units, or leash them with your explorer, even the colossal ones! Even your spies can call upon a giant sandworm with enough intrigue!The quest system I think is also a highlight. Now you can build buildings and extend their stats with multiple choices. No building is the same. Tired of creatures killing your trade convoy? Build an ultrasonic fence and the choice will present itself: repel aliens further or make your convoys tamper proof.The Diplomacy system is the lowlight. I like that you can see the incremental increase and decrease in rep along with the foreign Sponsor's commentary, but you have little control over agreements. Most of the time I just accept all their agreements, rack up points, and buy all the policies. Only afterwards do I forge agreements with them. Wars are solved with War Score, a point system based on how much damage you've done to the enemy vs what they've done to you. I don't like how you really don't have a decision in what you can earn as the spoils are automatically generated.I do suggest you get Rising Tide as well. This expansion does a lot for the game, including the ability to find artifacts that can be combined in giving your Sponser (civ) unique abilities or more stats.Pros+Lots of variety of planet types, from fungal to scorched.+Spying is high risk/high reward. Most prominent and developed I've ever seen in a Civ game.+The tech web is daunting at first, but gives to a lot of consideration. No longer are you just trying to build wonder after wonder to outmatch your opponent. The affinities, a leveling system based on ideology, makes it so you have to decide what you need: Is it more buildings and developments? Or more afinity to upgrade your units?+4 ways to upgrade: Virtues, Diplomatic Capitol, Affinities, and Tech Tree.+Exploring and creating expeditions to hunt for resources and artifacts (If you have Rising Tide)Cons-Wonders. They are just not as prominent in this game, nor are they something you usually want to spend countless turns buildling. -Diplomacy is essentially broken (see above). -Sometimes the territory with its cracks and miasma poisoning clouds make it extremely hard to navigate for confrontations.7/10			",73,16,0,30,9,0,10

Its a fun game and as a fan of CIV 5, I can recomend it to anyone who wants more CIV to play. Its also pretty cheap ;D			",293,65,4,36,34,3,37

												Civ V in space!And yes it sucks B I G time, just like vanilla Civ V! Great graphics but no feeling what so ever. Worst of all is that units upgrade automatic where ever they are. So if you are in war and your enemy has units in your territory they upgrade automatic if your opponent discovers a new tech. In Civ you have to be inside your own borders to be able to upgrade units. This not only sucks it makes you ♥♥♥♥ing angry.-Trade routes are fun at first, but when you have a couple of cities its really annoying.-Techtree SUCKS!!-Exploring is booooooring-No feeling-No replay or score on retirement-After a couple of turns in the game its actually quite boring-N O T Alpha Centauri 2 in any way!!!-Makes you mad (when you think back on previous games from Mr Meier, how good they are, and how bad this is!)-Sucks in late game-Have I mentioned its boring?+Graphics+Covert ops If you wanna buy this crap, then wait for the DLC's or a big saleSo do yourself a favor, give this game your middle finger and buy Pandora: First Contact instead!

												I don't recommend this title as a Civilization Fan.  Its literally a rather cheap rip/mod from Civ5 that was supposed to be so much better.  To be blatently obvious though, the game needs serious gameplay balancing. Also for the hype it tried to give us, its predecessor ""Alpha Centauri"" even though very old now, is better at custom units by far.  This of course also goes to say that there still is no way to terraform like Alpha Centari.Even worse off is that this ""new"" game if you dare even call it that, actually has even less terraforming then Civ5.  Even less options to do with tile improvements.The AI are also incredibly predictable and annoying in this, but the same can be said about all the AI in Civilization games.So if you want my advice, I'd seriously recommend waiting for this to be on a good sale before I'd bother picking it up.Fraxis if you bother reading this, or this far.  I am terribly sorry, but this title let me down on what I was hoping to see.--Edit: > DLC  ContentOk so I'm back to add to this review of mine, even though it wont change alotBecause of how the DLC (Rising Tide) changes the game theres some things I should say.Finally they did address some of the balance and lack of customization issues the game had before as well as adding some unique aspects like artifacts that unlock hidden bonuses and wonders.A new leader trait system and trait agreement / trading system is in the game as well as a new currency for it that  can also purchage units and buildings.. ""Political Capital"".  Some of these traits help tailor your Civ to what you want it to be like, but also in saying that the options come up a bit short of what you'd really like to see at times.Of course now that we can just plop cities down in the ocean adds some interesting bits too but again thats more like how Alpha Centauri / Alien Crossfire used to be.About game balance, well its better now but still has moments of why is this level 40 something hostile alien even standing next to my towns.. at turn 10 or less at times.  When our explorer is 3 strength...  That and oh yea.. shoot the  aliens and they'll hate you  the rest of the game and eat units at random, otherwise they just wander around and do nothing other then stop the auto turn timer as your town thinks its a good idea to shoot them constantly.. when its better to ignore the aliens as things you dont poke just so you can get things done.I could go on but.. bottom line..  Game + DLC.. not worth $60.. go get a new game like Civ 6 for $60 as this ones a year plus old and they want too much for it.			",123,20,2,26,29,0,38

												Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth is much like the previous Civilization 5. You get thrown into a world where you rule a civilization and compete, barter, go to war with and befriend other civilizations on your way to conquer the world. This is a turn based strategy game on a hexagonal grid. When all your units have taken a turn, you let the next civilization have its turn. You start with a home settlement that increases in size over time. With each settlement, you select a unit or facility that will then be complete after X amount of turns. During your turn you'll also pick a technology to research that results in new facilities that can get unlocked to build in your settlements. Its all streamlined so you don't have to hunt for the next city or unit to move, you'll already have them selected.It looks like plenty of people are complaining that this is too similar of a game to Civilization 5, and they're right. However, it still feels like a good fresh sci-fi version of the game. The previous Civilizations made good use of historic characters, but this game lacks those characters and that personality. They still manage to put in all Earth's nations into this game without any sort of alien races. The real hurdle for me was the game crashing every time after the opening cinematic. That seems to have gotten fixed.No matter what randomly generated world you play, its a hostile one, full of insect aliens that will oppress you. They spawn from nests, attack your troops, and cities. It can be difficult to even get out of your cities to grow and thrive. The game has a combat edge to it. There are combat troops, both melee and long range that can fight on land, water and air.  The insects are there to grind and train your troops, to give them experience, get them leveled up with selectable perks for each level.  Melee units can only attack the tile next to them, while long ranged can attack up to two tiles away. Each unit has its own movement distance and you can set up a unit to move far away and it will get there over X amount of turns without you having to move it each and every turn.Each unit has a wide array of commands, move, attack, explore, alert so they wake up if an enemy comes in range, fortify to heal themselves, and more. When you have a combat unit selected and hover your mouse over an enemy, you can see the likely outcome who will do more damage. Its a nice system.Its not all combat though, there are worker units that will gather resources and build things. Thankfully you can assign a worker to work on his own so you don't need to control him. Explorers can find and mine resources. Colonists can go out and make a new settlement as long as its three tiles away from any other settlement. It is best to have an armed escort go with them, since they aren't meant for combat.When a new settlement forms, it controls a few tiles around it, making that your territory. As the population grows, so does the radius of tiles. So you can connect your settlements into one big territory. Since its your territory, other civilizations need to ask for your permission to travel freely through it. They will offer you tributes for the rights and you barter back and forth with them to make a deal happen. Do you want energy (currency) each turn for their travel? Do you want rights to travel through their land as well? Do you even trust them to travel through your land? They could be setting up a siege to conquer your settlements.The civilizations can be both nice and hostile. Some civilizations feel that your rapid expansion near their territory is a cause for concern and they'll warn you to stop. The game keeps track of your promises too. If you say you won't build another settlement, you might risk a war if you do. Then at some point the game will tell you that your promise has been kept and you can build another settlement at your leisure. Some will even warn you that you've slaughtered too many people or insects and you need to stop. Its all a delicate balance.You can make alliances with countries, ask them if they'll go to war with another civilization. There is a lot of depth here, but some are justifiably unwilling to budge. Just because someone declared war on you doesn't mean one of your allies will help save you. There is a nifty diplomacy tab to see what is going on politically. Who is at war with who and your relationship to other civilizations.If combat isn't your thing, there are covert ops. You can unlock the ability, build a facility, train your agents by defending your cities from spies that will steal your technology or energy. Then send your agents abroad to other cities and do the same to them. It also becomes a political issue, when agents are found or killed. Do you let it slide or declare war? Its all a way to get around combat. I did find a giant covert ops breaking bug. When an agent was idle, the covert ops panel was just black and empty.Beyond Earth feels like a race to see who can decimate the other civilizations. A tranquil, relaxing game can turn very stressful when your neighbor picks a fight and declares war. I would say the game lets you play how you want, but like other Civilization games, I felt dragged into war, bullied and unable to stop it. If someone declares ware, you can always make a peace treaty by offering them up resources or things like cities. Yep you can give them your cities, because they'll take them anyway.Settlements can defend themselves, but they'll soon get overwhelmed. Its really a competition over land. Who controls the most land. Who has the most settlements to generate things. There is a problem though. Sometimes the civilization outgrows its energy consumption. If energy consumption dips below the reserve energy supply, the units will begin to disband one per turn. This balances out the energy consumption, but makes units disappear and leaves you vulnerable. That is the risk you run having a grand civilization.Sometimes there is not enough food in your cities and it will halt their growth. To compensate, you can unlock trade depots and trade convoys, then set their trade routes between settlements to distribute food, energy and resources.For those that need goals, the game does have quests, but I found myself ignoring them to do what I wanted. Competing a quest, gives you a choice between two perks. It was always a real toss up. I never felt like any perk offered was that much of a game changer.The game feels excessive when it comes to frills. There are civilization perk trees, technologies to unlock and even troop upgrades. The upgrades change every troop of that type. You even get to select a permanent perk for that type. The choice and the random worlds make for huge replay value. The excessive frills are useful for marathon games. You'll always have something new to unlock thousands of turns into the game. With different difficulties and different sizes of planets to inhabit, one game could go on forever!Beyond Earth is still a good game, its just like Civilization 5 and its expansion with a sci-fi twist. I would have appreciated alien races other than insect fodder.			",1129,324,52,104,96,15,167

												I'm a big sid meiers fan, I've collected and played all their games from new, from pirates to civ, and this is the biggest disappointment to date, civ 5 was bad, but boy did they rush this out, its the same old , same old, but with aliens, firstly why would mankind travel into space to start a new world, settle, then war with each other, yes maybe in time but come on, I was only started when they attacked, and why, the war went on, the ai sent six mixed army marines , soldiers and artillery, I sent in three marines to defend, and yes my three marines beat the ai, then the game crashed, and I had to do it all again on the startup, and then the ai made peace anyway ! I feel its a big waste of time and money, if this was something else other than a game, you'd be able to take it back and get a refund, but as a game they rush it out, throw it at us , charge £30 , and say, tell us about the bugs and we'll fix them, well I'm sorry, but if you went out and bought a car, tv, or mobile phone that was made by a multi national company, you'd expect better. its not good enough for 2014, it was ok in amiga, c64 and even the first computers, but theres no excuse now.

												Overall not bad.  Gave it a 'recommended' but in a way just barely, mostly due to the price.   Essentially, this is a CIV 5 overhaul.  It is more of a really big expansion than a whole new game.  It does contain some elements and terminology from the olde SMAC, which was one of my all time favorite games, but it lacks a lot of the social interaction and wit:  ""... don't go; the drones need you, the look up to you.""  I am not sure what some of the other reviewers are referring to as bugs, it seems rock stable and runs fine.  The soundtrack is pretty good and the graphics are upper middle class ;)The tech web (instead of tech tree) is  not as intuitive as a standard tech tree and is a bit cumbersome.  There is also less depth in some of the interface, information and management in a lot of areas, particularly compared to civilization IV, which , IMHO, was the best of the Civ game.  So as an upgrade or expansion of Civ V, this is great, but it should have been $20-$30 tops, not $50.			",11,5,0,5,12,0,12

												Classic Civ players will find this more like the Alpha Centauri game than classic civ, but if you liked it and understand teh Civ interface you can jump in pretty quickly.  Then the changes happen, with lots of strange future tech, factions, and the creatures versus barbarians antagonist (or not).  Quirkly someone vague victory conditions, the pseudoscience of the techs, and not many net positive mechanical changes from Civ IV make it less than perfect.  It's not Civ IV or Civ V, but it is still a good game.  I have had alot of fun with it, and feel that you could justify the value at full price, but should try and get it at least 50% off ( > $15USD), and it has been out on the Wb for as low as $10US.  Apparently the DLC makes it a better game, but I don't have that yet, and will review that separately when I do finally purchase.7.5/10			",1536,680,63,205,238,16,336

												Civ: BE at the time of writing isn't worth the money unless on sale. While the game is good, it's not different enough (yet) from Civilization 5 to warrant purchase in my opinion. I am of the full belief that this game will at some point be a game worthy of individual purchase, and will follow a formula similar to Civ 5, in that it will have very good DLC that make the game considerably better. But, for the time being, unless you've invested 500 or more hours into Civ 5 and desperately want a slightly different Civ feel, I'd recommend sticking to/purchasing Civ 5 and it's DLCS.I should mention this game, like Civ 5, has a great Workshop community creating mods at an ever increasing rate.EDIT: The most recent DLC, Rising Tides, does make the game a bit more enjoyable, completely reworking the way diplomacy and war works, as well as adding somewhat mobile floating ocean cities. The DLC is an improvement, but not enough to add more than around 10 hours of gameplay for me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												These reviews don't give this game justice.First off this is not Alpha Centauri, it never was suppose to be. If you have that expectation you will be disappointed. If you have not played and loved Civilization V in the past, there is a strong chance you will may not like this game. This is a turn based strategy game, which means that this is not for everyone. Features/Gameplay compared to Civ V:This game uses the same engine as Civilization V however, there are major differences in gameplay. First and most important: the aliens are not like barbarians in Civ V. Sometimes you leave them alone and they will leave you alone, they have these unofficial terroritories and if you don't go into those areas they usually will not come to you unless somebody has been♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥them off by killing them. Two important aliens are the siege worms (land) and the kraken (sea). It is a huge pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to kill these things in the beginning to mid game unless you are near a city firing ranged. Trade routes are available from the start, and who you trade with impacts diplomacy with the AI players. Stations will leave if nobody trades with them.There are tiles that are infected with Miasma, a poison. Depending on the type of Affinity you choose, you either destroy the Miasma (it hurts you) or spread it (it heals you). Each player chooses their own Affinity so there are inherent conflicts of interest. Technology is no longer linear, it is now a web. Which means you can go in any direction at any time. As you gain new technologies you gain Affinity points. When you get more points your units globally upgrade instantly.  You can also complete quest and do a few other things to get Affinity points. In order to win certain victories, you have to have a ton of Affinity points. You will NOT get all the technologies in a single game. Mid to end game units are unique to Affinity.Spies are more important, in my last game I had a coup and took a player's CAPITAL from them, peacefully. (We did not  go to war). You can detonate a dirty bomb in peoples cities ,attract siege worms, steal tech, steal science, steal money etc with spies.I almost forget the orbital system. You can use these satalites to give you every advantage (economic, military, add/remove  Miasma, counter-intelligence etc)The victory system is not so sudden. You can tell the progress each player has made toward winning. You will know early on how far ahead/behind you are and if a full scale invasion may be necessary to prevent the leader from beating you. It is easy to stop a player in the final stages from winning if you have the military to do so. My impression:This game takes the Civilization series in the right direction. The gameplay changes made are beyond the scope of a mod or expansion pack, this is a NEW game that goes beyond new skins and units. I love the game, it is well made, and definitely worthy of being a ""civilization"" game.This is a very good guide for people are interested: http://well-of-souls.com/civ/civbe_overview.html ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: October 29, 2014
												Civilization Beyond Earth is yet another mixed offering in a storied franchise that continues to bank on (and make bank from) its name. The game features a number of system overhauls compared to Civilization V that are largely a mixed bag. The first of these major overhauls is the affinity system which creates a faction system inside of a traditional civilization structure. This system is effectively the evolution of the religion system from earlier civilization games and in theory is powerful and interesting. Unfortunately it isn't implemented in the most interesting way often leaving you to simply level up a faction by researching certain dead end technologies. Once more the system as it supports gaining levels of multiples of these factions at once could potentially make the diplomacy more interesting but in true fashion for the series this opportunity is missed as your AI rivals only care about your most prominent affinity in relation to their most prominent. If you have 9 purity but 10 supremacy you'll no doubt notice the negative effect this will impart when dealing with opponents with 3 purity and 0 of the affinities.Also new is the shift from the traditional civilization technology tree to a technology web more common in space 4x games. This is largely a positive change though many leaf technologies (dead ends related to another technology) feel underwhelming and only relevant in relation to the affinity system.The unit upgrade system has been significantly limited and also linked into the affinity system. Experience will only allow your unit a minor attack bonus or an instant heal while certain affinity break levels will result in much more powerful upgrades many of which are familiar from previous upgrade systems. Unfortunately while this system alone may be serviceable with appropriate balancing it contributes to a wide ranging problem in the game: readability. This unit upgrades each result in a unique name most of which are exceedingly bland and non-descriptive (such as phantom, cruiser, etc). This means while in a civilization game you may be able to instantly recognize a musketeer has an advantage on a spearman in Beyond Earth you will spend tons of time trying to figure out just what your opponents units are.Similar readability problems are plentiful through out the game. City name plates and worker assignment buttons are so huge they can obscure units or a clear view of the resource points of each hex in city assignment. Many button positions are arbitrarily flipper from Civ V with little reason for instance the city inspection close buttons. Most technologies have no clear indicators (such as color coding) suggesting either what element they are focused on or even if elements they unlock are buildings or wonders.Finally the game suffers from a terrible case of misallocated funds. Rival faction leaders each feature a 3d model with multiple part/texture changes based on affinity and fairly large amount of voice acting. Wonders lack engaging artwork (featuring a pan over generic blue print style drawings of ambiguous mechanical junk) and much of the dialogue with voice acting related to affinity levels, technologies, and wonders seems like it features only one or two voice actors (which of course becomes rather tiring). Once more the writing which is obviously trying for the rather difficult tone of Alpha Centauri falls flat. While Alpha Centauri featured a mix of solid sci-fi tropes most related to the genera were somewhat were familiar with punctuated by brief flights of whimsy to justify a funny aside, Beyond Earth features largely science dumb gobbledygook with repetitive jokes many being recycled in numerous places.

												Let's begin with explanation here: I hated Beyond Earth, since it crushed my dreams of SMAC remake. Though I have enjoyed the game, it felt bleak and shallow.Not anymore.I was skeptic first when Rising Tide was announced, and had a lot of doubts whether it's going to be worthy expansion. And let me tell you, boy I was wrong.Rising Tide enhances gameplay significantly. It's definitely worth to buy it, if you already have Beyond Earth. New units, hybrid affinities, floating cities, volcanic planets, new diplomacy, new sponsors. There's a ton of new features that will refresh Beyond Earth's gameplay.Like in Civilization V, with every new expansion the game becomes more and more complex and fun. Go grab it, you won't regret.And remember! Space Korea is the Best Korea.			",34,0,1,4,7,1,20

												Look it's kinda interesting but it feels like a reskin of Civ 5. Largely could have been done with a mod on it in fact. All the original problems of Civ 5 at the start are there. -AI is dumb(er), not even to the standard of Current Civ 5 with expansions.-Trade:  It's ok at the start but most of the time but as it progresses AI ask for rediculous deals or demand rediculous prices-Final tier units: are not remotely equal to others of tier.-Tech web: Not nearly diverse enough-could be a lot of improvements on it.-Victory conditions: Are all basically slightly dif flavours of the same thing and the only option to interfere with people's     victories is war. It needs a couple expansions that I'm not excited to pay for. Very glad I bought this offsite at half price. Oh and a final nitpick. It's not pretty. Colours just clash.The good. Trade: Much more important. The Bad: needs better implementation, auto repeat trades things like that.Espionage is cool. Pretty critical in fact.			",312,65,1,57,24,3,60

												Like most people that loved Civilization 5 I couldn't wait to get my hands on this game. Even though the gameplay trailer showed that it looked very similar to its predecessor I still pre-ordered it. This was a huge mistake. Beyond Earth pales in comparison to 5. They have taken 5, reskinned it and then taken everything that was good about it and thrown it away. I thought the addition of a technology web would add a new feel of variety to the game when all it does is overcomplicate things and confuse the player. The quests that it gives are quite often very buggy and there is no clear goal in sight when you start. I don't think I could be more dissapointed with this terrible game. Don't make the mistake I did, do NOT purchase this game. If you have never played civilizations before then I emplore you to get Civilizations 5 with or without the dlc.			",64,1,3,3,3,3,2

												After winning my first game in CIV BE, here's what I think.. IIf you are not trying to compare this game and take it as it's own, it is a very enjoyable game with a lot of interesting features. If you start wishing it was more like CIV 5, or 6, you'll think it falls short of expectation. I'm glad I did not bother with the mixed reviews and will definitively play more of it.

												9 out of 10 Civilization Beyond Earth (CBE) is without a doubt my favorite turn based strategy game ever.  Don't expect Civilization 5 with different clothes; they have superficial similarities but play Very differently. The good: 1. You may develop in different directions depending on what takes your fancy.  This game has little of the linear development found in other Civilization games. 2. I love the research system which is without direction.  From the start of a game, you can research anything within a few steps.  Yet, it would be suicidal to go for the advanced techs immediately. 3. The game has lots of interesting land units.  In addition you can select different upgrades for depending on your affinity. 4. All units upgrade automatically.  You don't have to struggle to find them and then pay to upgrade them. 5. You have very limited info on your opponents.  You don't get those detailed comparison charts like in other Civ games.  This increases the tension. 6. The game is full of balancing factors which you need to keep in mind when building your empire.  The most important ones are Health, Number of Units and Number of Cities. The bad: 7. The game has some interface issues.  They could have made it easier to wake you sleeping military units. 8. The game needed different types of aerial units (at least for specialization against air, land and sea units and cities).  The game also needed anti-aerial units. 9. I like the diplomacy system.  It is unlike other Civ games where empires hold a grudge for ever over insignificant scuffles started by them 200 turns ago.  Unfortunately you cannot trade technologies or resources like in other Civ games. 10. The game really bogs down if you have lots of cities.  My (oldish) PC struggled a bit.  But more importantly it can take you a long time to play a few turns because of all the choice you need to make.  Some city build automation options would have been welcome. The ugly: Nothing A lot of the negative comment and reviews on this game was made when it first came out.  In its current form with all expansions it truly is an amazing game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you liked Civilization 5 and never played Alpha Centuari, you'll probably like this game... is a decent game. But if like me you spent thousand of hours playing SMAC, you'll find this game very disappointing... damn i still have it installed, and a 15+ years old game, graphics apart, do everything better than this... the AI is much better and feel more realistic (a lot more dialogues and messages), you can REALLY design your own units, atrocity system with international sanctions, cities on both land and water, better terraforming...A decent game, but nothing more.

												They didn't even bother fixing the same exact bugs that Civ V had...It's even a step backwards from Civ V in many aspects of the game, such as how hard it is to see the difference between grassland, plains, tundra, and desert, or flat land, hills, and forest. There's so much wrong with this ""new"" Civ game that it would take an essay to cover it all... just don't buy it, ok?			",60,8,0,15,6,1,21

												Currently I would not recommend this game to fans of Civ series or Alpha Centauri. Generally lackluster without the personalities that stood out in Alpha Centauri and a complete lack of polish compared to Civ5 in its current form. This is really a reskin without much else going for it. Very disappointed that I preordered it.  Hopefully sometime down the road it will be patched and we will have a much better spiritual successor to Alpha Centauri, because currently this doesn't come close.			",116,42,1,37,26,0,32

Posted: October 25, 2014
												Just won my first marathon game! I wanted to play the most alien thing I could so I played on a Fungal world, played for Transcendance, and set aliens to 'high'. I'll compare the game to Civ 5 rather than AC since I think thats more relevant to those claiming it to be DLC-like.Pros: -Game runs smoother than Civ5. Even in late game the game loaded turns faster which may be something to consider if that caused you major grievances on less than awesome machines.-No happiness. Several things simply got a 'sci-fi' name from Civ5 counterparts, but happiness being replaced with the health system is a very good thing. Large empires in more difficult settings were kind of a silly thing to do in Civ5 so this really opens the game up more.-Tech tree. Its more complicated than normal research in Civ5 and many of the sub-branches allow you to further your affinity that shape your civ. Its possible to go into mupltiple branches that dont link well early on, or do the opposite and go too far in one branch without getting basics from others that leave you crippled. I think there will be good metagame here.-Starter perks. Unlike Civ5 where you start as some thugs beating rocks together, BE lets you pick your crew types, spaceship type, and supplies you bring with you that lends to a more custom start up appropriate to a sci-fi setting.-Esp and Trade are the same and slightly improved from the Civ5 versions that came in DLC. The spys in BE have far more options here that can really hurt your enemies (I let out a thumper that called Alien Siege Wurms in an enemy city) and the amount of trade routes you have running rivals that of Venice without actually playing a 1 city civ.-Aliens. I started my game with the sensors that locate alien nests, which populate over the largest xeno pools in the game (a resource needed for a heavy Harmony Affinity) so I knew right off if I wanted to re-start the game and where I would first go for my expansions. The alien hordes themselves feel more natural in civ. They basically behave like aggresive animals and I appreciated their AI far more than 'barbarians', even on their most aggresive setting.-Satalite layer. I didnt get too far into satalites as some affinities might with orbital attacks but these really add new options. Some would populate un-modded areas with lux and strategic resources, another pumped down miasma (a toxic gas thats poisons enemies but heals and gives combat bonus' to Harmony civs), and this giant low orbit squid that pooped more miasma and gave combat bonus' to units down below. Its definately a good addition.-Late game. The combat in late game gets really fun. All your units get upgraded for free based on your chosen affinity and by the end all your 'rovers' and 'missile rovers' are hovertanks flying across the ocean. The affinity-based units, and mega-units are a huge deal. 1 turn before my MInd Flower finished I had 2 Evolved Xeno Titans (think GDR *10) wreck my enemies earth gateway while shrugging off all the stuff they were throwing at them the whole time; it was a good ending!Cons:-NPC identities. The bonus' you get for each civ seem limited. In Civ5 you got more 'things' that defined you. You can definately shape your civ over time the way you want more in BE but by end-game you likely have your main affinity maxed and went on to others and begin to lose your uniqueness. The actual bonus' that are unique to your civ seem so marginal I kinda wonder why they even bothered putting them in. I'd have liked to see more special units/buildings or abilites for each civ that pushed them more in the dirrection of certain affinities.  One civ asked me to declare war on another by the name of their leader alone and without being able to open my diplomacy tab I was just left thinking 'who the heck is that?'. Its not like you had the same issue in Civ5 when someone asked you to kill Washington but... I'm sure I'll get used to it.-City States, or outposts as they're called. The game dosnt just found cities; it starts them as an 'outpost' early on that developes into a city (which by itself I think is fine). My issue is these random outposts that pop up, never turn into full cities, and pretty much act like city states with even less options. Beyond a few good trade routes, they seem to be completelly irrelevant. NPC civs attack them without issue from the rest of the world, there is no friendship meter with these people. It seems a step in the wrong dirrection and lots of wasted potential.-No global politics. I know this was added in a DLC, but.. considering how these people are supposed to be futuristic, and instantly connected the moment they pop into the world, I find it wierd that there would be no futuristic council when the story goes: they just left a world that HAD one. AI of NPC civs in BE is slightly better but the global politics and amount of favors we curried from city states made the Civ5 game feel more developed on a global scale. -No terraforming. I know know, its not AC, and I was honestly too young to even remember much about that game. I do remember the terraforming though which allowing you to + and - land and ocean, and being able to build cities underwater. A 'terraformed' tile improvement is just a really good jungle and you can do some terraforming-type stuff with the new satalites but I was kinda hoping for a little more. Maybe its a limitation with the Civ5 engine, but I still have my fingers crossed some DLC with add this.All in all I think this is a very good game. I'd give it a 8-8.5 depending on much you <3 sci-fi.  I think I'll have quite a few very good playthroughs with the different affinities but I'm not sure I'll get as much playtime from this as Civ5. If that turns you off maybe wait until its a little cheaper but even at full price I still think its worth it. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												All in all, it's not the worst little game I've played. But that's just it... it's little. Small of scope, if you will. What this is, make no mistake about it, is just a reskin of Civ-V minus half, if not more, of the (expansion driven) depth.  Quests? More like ""pick your perk"", no depth, no feeling of actually being on an alien planet. In fact, this feels like ""Earth Invasion 2035"" or some modpack of like name, since this could have been done (and I can't help to repeat myself) as a mod. Sure, sure. ""How dare you compare it to something like Alpha Centauri?! You shouldn't, it's not meant to be a clone.""Duh, really, nobody expected a clone, we expected better. But let's test that ""This aint SMAC"" theory shall we?In the past Civilization added something called Colonization to it's stable. And somewhat later they added something called  Alpha Centauri which was about the remnants of mankind or some such fleeing the Earth to establish colonies on an alien planet, hopefully to prosper. Does this ring a bell? Noticed that pattern repeating itself lately?  Colonization then ... ?(Yes, I am aware of the period of time that passed between many of these games... but theystill are part and parcel of SM's brand.) Years have run their course since SMAC first appeared, the tools and resources for making incredible games have become more amazing, more streamlined (to some extent) and the pool of creativity has increased god knows how much. How the hell do you make a game STEP BACK in quality and depth, not just from its ""ancient"" predecessor but also from a base game that was released not long before? I mean this sucks even compared to CIV V, the base game of which at least kept me interested in it for the amount of turns it took to research everything and take over most of the map.Perhaps next time we spend a little less money and time on cut scenes and promo video clips and more on gameplay development.I pray and I hope they take an inordinate amount of time and effort with the expansions (if any) to flesh out this ""game"". But somehow I get the feeling the mod community will have to nurture this poor pup to its potential. If not, well then perhaps it is best to let nature do what she does best.			",95,21,2,28,33,0,45

												A lot of people aren't fans of BE, and for good reason - it needs more polish. That said, Rising Tide added a metric boatload of polish and turned BE into a much better game. So, if you haven't picked this up along with Rising Tide, do so immediately! It's seriously worth it! It's full of cool mechanics and ideas that I'd like to see in the next Civ titles, like orbitals, affinities, and agreements.Maybe if we could get another expansion pack, this would be just as good as BE. Give this wonderful game a try, I promise you it's a whole lot better now! ",175,56,0,24,24,0,44

												Disapointing.  Not terrible but is inferior to both Civ V and the far older SMAC with less depth, content and less enjoyable, the game looks and feels like a cut down version of Civ V than a full game.  It plays the same all the way through, with the few new units bringing little change or options and they lack either the choice of customisation of SMAC or the experience options when leveling up of Civ V.

												This game is...a Civ game.  There's nothing big about it compared to other Civ games.  You can specialize your units in a certain direction based on the decisions you make (making them drastically different) but in the end it really feels like those choices don't necessarily matter.  At the end of the day, you're going to make the decision to go down a tree that you have the resources to go down.The game makes it seem as though you're going to be colonizing the galaxy, yet all you're doing is colonizing another planet that is just like Earth with some alien biology.  I was hoping for some planet jumping instead of just the same thing skinned as an alien planet with future tech.If you have previous Civ games, I recommend avoiding this.  There isn't enough change to warrant buying another one.  I made the mistake while it was on sale and somewhat regret it.  The concept was promising, the execution was not unfortunately.

												In all honesty, I kinda regret this purchase. i was hoping to play this till Art of War came out, but now I'm just like 'nah'. It's thematically interesting, but not different nor fleshed out enough from Civ 5 to warrant 50 dollars. After countless hours of playing Civ 5 I just got bored after the first few games of this and having to keep restarting to find the ideology aligned resources. I had the game set to high difficulty and set to frenzy aliens, but nothing of note happened. Aliens hovered around, but never attacked, all the factions got along... Just waiting. It feels more like a well made mod rather than a full blown standalone game. I'd recommend a game more like Endless Legend.			",9,4,0,10,6,0,12

												I was completely bored with it by the end of my second game (over 750 hours in civ 5) and probably wont be going back for quite a while. They stripped TOO much out of the game in my opinion (natural wonders, religion, etc.) and it just makes for a VERY boring ride. I love this franchise and probably always will, honestly i feel like 2k is the WRONG publisher for these games because of the way they handle dlc like money grubbing crack dealers. I dont see it as acceptable to remove features from a franchise game just to sell it back to people later, and we all know thats what they are going to be doing.. it should always be moving forward and innovating and attempting to do what it did last time better.. as such this game is a complete and utter failure			",33,7,0,3,2,1,12

												I love the Civilization games and have played all of them. This installment feels rushed. It's obviously based on Civilization V and feels more like an add-on than an entirely new game. Unfortunately most of us are paying full price.The different factions feel generic and even at higher difficulties the AI doesn't really put up a challenge. The trading system feels broken, it's far too easy to generate huge amounts of energy, science and production. The aliens are well done, but they are not more than a hindrance. Somehow the planet feels lifeless...I regret paying full price for this game. Also, what's up with most gaming sites scoring this an 8 or 9? Even with a few hours of game time the significant problems with balance should be visible.			",65,20,0,21,20,0,21

Never would I have thought that that sneak peak/teaser was basically the finsished product. I'm not going to lie this game is in fact ""fun."" However, it lacks a certain charm its predescesors posesed and just can't be considered a good game without out. That certain charm is what drew us all and kept us playing the civilization series.. Now it seems to be gone.While nice graphics and a new concept are nice, its the little things that made this games predescesor so good, so entertaining, so addictive. In all honesty this game seems to very incomplete. This game is like an unfinished project. So do not buy this game, wait til chirstmas sales. Or better yet, until a dlc comes out.

It's a new and refreshing entry into the Civilization franchise, breaking away from the usual thematic formula while maintaining excellent turn-based tactical gameplay established in Civ 5.

Of course it's not those games, it's a NEW game, and it's a very good game in its own right.  It's not perfect and it has its flaws, but it's been well worth the 500+ hours I've sunk into it.

												Over 450 hours. That's how much time I have on Civilization V. So, needless to say: I'm a big fan of the series, especially the predecessor to Beyond Earth. That said, I'm still not fatigued by the game, and I still can go back to Civ V and have a lot of fun on it. So, when Beyond Earth came out I was very excited to see what they'd do now that they're changing the setting to the future rather than the past and present.I'm going to be blunt: this is a massive letdown. This game is Civilization V if you sucked out all of its soul. This game has absolutely no personality, you don't get any of the old Ghandi and his nukes, or the backstabbing of Napoleon, or the wonder-stealing of Ramses. I've clocked up a good few hours on this game, and the leaders from this game are still yet to show any personality or do anything even remotely memorable.This is a big problem, as in Civ V: part of what made it fun was the fact that each Civilization had a unique AI, as well as unique abilities. The abilities of those Civilizations would mean that every game would feel different, not only based on the Civilization that you choose: but the AI you're pitted against, your starting location, and sometimes just plain luck would play huge a part in how the game plays out. In Civilization V, each Civilization got its own unique ability, unit, and/or building. But, in Beyond Earth, when you're choosing your Civ, you get one stat boost, and then you pick three more bonuses. These bonuses lack any depth, it's stuff like ""Get a free worker"" or ""Reveal minerals on the map"" or ""+2 culture for every city"", and it's all just either boring stat bonuses or getting certain abilities or units a little bit early. In Civ V, you would get things that no other Civilization gets, and you could build a strategy around that. For example, the fact that Venice can buy City-States makes them a truly unique civ to play, and offers a unique experience. Beyond Earth lacks that depth and personality, and it really feels like hardly any real effort went into its design. The bonuses that these new Civilizations get are more akin to the bonuses you'd get from religion in Civ V. It's nice that they're there, but they're hardly game-changing. I'd also like to point out that Civilization V has a total of 43 civilizations, whereas Beyond Earth has only 8. You'd expect that those 8 would be really detailed this time, given that they have considerably less things to work on but: no. They feel like the type of Civilization someone would make if they'd just started modding Civilization V.Also, the bonuses that you get from wonders are not very impressive. It's actually kind of hard to tell what is an isn't a wonder when looking at the technology tree, and their bonuses are so lacklustre you could easily mistake them for a standard building. On top of this, there are only 4 culture trees in this game, as opposed to the 13 that were in Civ V, and again: these trees are very boring and they offer things like ""+2 production when healthy"" and just really boring thoughtless things like that.The graphics in this game are ugly, frankly. The actual models look great, better than Civilization V, in fact. But, the UI is absolutely hideous. It uses blue: exclusively. This just adds to the lack of personality here, and it also kind of makes it hard to understand what's going on on the minimap. I played as Franco-Iberia in my first game, and their territory on the map is represented with a pale blue. This made it so that on the mini-map, my territory was light blue, land was a darker blue, and the sea was an even darker blue. It was kind of confusing to look at, and it made the landmasses (as well as my land) look highly amorphous. On top of that, it looked genuinely ugly. The game's UI is like an Apple store: just a cold colourless environment. Well, colourless apart from blue.Also, every victory type is the technology victory from Civ V. I mean, the exact same. No matter what Civilization you play as, no matter what you do, you are always doing it on behalf of advancing your technology. True, you can declare war and kill everyone, but whether or not you win is entirely based on who has the best technology: nothing else. There are a total of five victory types, but 4 of them are based on reaching the end of a technology tree. This is incredibly dull, because again, in Civilization V, you'd need different strategies to get different victory types. I could use the same strategy for every victory type in Beyond Earth. Why was there no cultural or diplomatic victory? Nope, all of the victory types in this game rely on you reaching the end of the technology tree that you've chosen.The aliens are better than the barbarians from Civilization V, but only by a bit. They're still a massive nuisance, but there are ways to avoid them, and even use them to your advantage. For example, I built a city on a one-tile-island very close to an alien nest in the sea, and I managed to use the aliens as a defence. But, they're still mostly a nuisance, so it's not a massive improvement. They also feel kind of unfinished, as a lot of buildings seem to make it sound as though you can tame the aliens and turn them to your side, but you really can't: they will always be either hostile or neutral.Another good feature is that the planets now have three different types of landscapes: terrain, fungal, and arid. They kind of shake up the atmosphere a bit, and it gives the illusion of variation quite well, which is a good thing. I'm unsure if they effect the resources or actual tile types, but it's quite nice playing on them (except fungal which is a nightmare because it is YET MORE BLUE).Just going back to the factions for a second, I'd just like to say that I highly object to there being no British civilization. In Civilization V I very much enjoyed playing as England and the Celts simply because I'm British and it's kind of cool to build places that you're very familiar with. Do Firaxis really believe that their European fanbase is entirely composed of French and Spanish people? There are more countries that have been completely excluded but it would take me far too long to list them all. In Civ V, they at least gave each country some kind of representation or another. For example, Italy wasn't in the game, but they instead included Rome and Venice, so they still had some representation in the game.It's not a terrible game, but it just doesn't have the personality or replayability of the earlier Civ games. Some of the changes it makes are for the better, like the removal of barbarians in favour of aliens, and the ability to choose to start with a worker rather than a warrior. But, the idea of letting the players create their own civilizations has just made the game feel very thoughtless and rushed.Pick it up only if you've somehow exhausted Civilization V and it is at a significantly reduced price.

												As someone who has put in 800+ hours in Civ V and god knows how much in IV and III, it sucks to admit that I'm pretty dissapointed with CIV:BE. Overall, it's a fun new experience, but doesn't compare to Alpha Centuri and its UI is begging for a patch out of the box. Summary:+Affinities are a great expansion to how your units and cities look like. +Enhanced narrative through sidequests / city state colonies+Social policies have been put into 4 trees and it works well!+Harmony affinity / alien units are pretty rad!+Terrain generation is really cool and has good variety. +Spying has been improved so you can stage a Coup and snag an entire city if you're successful. - [~personal] I'm not a fan of how units are perma upgraded now. - [~personal] CIV:BE feels like it chose visuals over gameplay- No natural wonder equivalents [ Gimme a badass Volcanoe that gives +8 science!]- No religion of any kind [ Gimme cyber future religion!] - UI could use a LOT of color differentiation [ In the Tech Tree I can't tell what's a building and what's a wonder]. - Affinities should function like ideology [Once you pick one you stick with it rather than juggle 3 of them]. - [~personal] Another thing that bogs this title down is the limited expressions and butchered fake voice acting for some leaders (Slavic Federation and Brasilia; Kozlov's voice is just some Berkeley hipster reading off Google Translate with a Russian accent / which is odd because Catharine's voice in V was 100% authentic. )+/- Trade works the same way as in Civ V, and thats ok I guess.+/- Diplomacy is exactly the same and thats ok too, I guess+/- No Nukes / Mass Destruction+/- No Space Mongolians / Space banditsAt the end of the day, while it does offer a brand new experience, an impressive terrain script and an expanded narrative in the form of quests, I cannot recommend this game in its current state at its current price until it's at least patched and some gameplay elements are significantly improved.

												At first, it was awesome. It was what every Civ fan wanted. When first playing, everything looked amazing, the art work is brilliant.But man, did you screw up, Sid.Nothing is balanced. At all. Ever. Your economy is ridiculous, and it never really works, especially with all this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t about satellites, and 2 ♥♥♥♥ing trade routes per city (which can easily lead to you never having a problem with money, which is not at all interesting). And no great people! What the ♥♥♥♥!? No ♥♥♥♥ing great people? After you introduced 10 or something great people in Civ 5? What the ♥♥♥♥! Also, workers don't give a flying♥♥♥♥♥♥about your economy at all on automated mode, and will just build whatever the ♥♥♥♥ they want because #yolo. You have no choice but to manually control them, as this automated mode is ♥♥♥♥ing useless.Also, WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ IS THE ""TECH WEB""? WHY DID YOU DO THIS SID? IT'S♥♥♥♥♥♥ It just doesn't work. I like the idea of going in different directions in technology to have a different outcome at the end of the game, but it just leaves you with major holes in your technology, which is ♥♥♥♥ing stupid and prevents you from doing very important things (like having a basic flying unit).The quest system? Alright, I don't got beef with that, that's cool, no major problems. But, a massive ♥♥♥♥ing problem is the MASSIVE ♥♥♥♥ING LACK IN ACTUAL CIVS. I MEAN, IT'S CALLED CIVILIZATION ISN'T IT? SO WHERE THE ♥♥♥♥ ARE THEY? I mean really, they just don't ♥♥♥♥ing exist at all, you have to download mods to actually have a decent amount, and I'll be damned if I'm gonna wait for DLC to have some more.Art work? ♥♥♥♥ing cool, straight up. That stuff is glorious, and the animations are perfect and awesome, especially the aliens. SHAME YOU COULDN'T USE THAT EFFORT TO BALANCE YOUR GAME, SID. Also, where the ♥♥♥♥ is my adviser counsel? I have no ♥♥♥♥ing clue if some prick's army is stronger than mine at all. How the♥♥♥♥♥♥am I supposed to figure that out by myself? Manually scout their ♥♥♥♥ing territory? ♥♥♥♥ off, my adviser is supposed to do that for me! SO WHERE IS HE? What about demographics? How do I know if I'm actually better than someone else? I mean really, I have to shoot in the dark regularly just to try and win the game, and I have no ♥♥♥♥ing clue if that's overkill or if I'm losing badly anyway. I'm really disappointed in you, Sid. This could have been amazing, but you ruined it. Might as well download some sci-fi mods for Civ 5, and that'll be 10 times better. I mean, I love you Sid, you made some real sweet games in the past, but this? Ugh, it hurts me to think about it. If and when the DLC comes out, it better sort it out, or I'll write another angry review to directly target your feelings, and believe me, this hurts me more than it hurts you. For shame, Sid, for shame.			",42,4,0,10,6,0,7

												In its current state, no, I do NOT recommend this game.  Honestly there is some AWESOME stuff and if they fix it, I would totally recommend it to everyone. It was a lot of fun at first and they introduced some very cool elements and a cool environment. But, they flopped for a few reasons, only some of which are below. In a nutshell, it's Civ 5 with liposuction and a facelift. Unfortunately they liposuctioned out good stuff like city states and replaced them with barely-noticable ""Stations"" (seriously, all you can do is send them trade convoys, or destroy them for a minimal one time resource gain).Please save your money. Here are a few reasons why:You can't turn off time victory! I only had Domination selected and yet the game still ended when the time ran out. Time is not even an option as a victory condition. **Will not play again with Time victory**Other issues:-Spawning: The map is HUGE and they feel the need to land 2 of 3 other civilizations on MY ISLAND. There are a ton of islands left. Two bigger or the same size. Same story in the other Civ games, putting people on the same land or in the same area when there's a whole wide world out there.Incompetent Civs: Something that didn't change that should have was the stupidity of the other Civs involved. All I did was trade with them and they denounce me. No provocation. Then they go to war with me and say it's because of what I've done. Affinity quest choices that make even a tiny bit of sense:I went Harmony. I have screenshots of the choices I was given for the quest where humans went to another planet, mixed with the indigenous life, then came to mine. For some inexplicable reason, if I send them away I GAIN harmony! And when they ask to trade later, if I refuse to trade, I GAIN harmony! That doesn't mesh with harmony's philosophy. But apparently Harmony followers are Space Racists just like Purity, only they happen to include one more planet than Purity followers. But 3 or more planets, no way, is that what you're saying?Random Outposts: Aside from accepting trade from Stations, do they have another function?  ",138,27,2,31,3,2,20

												Beyong Earth is like Civ 5 with new graphics, except they've left out some core mechanics, screw up the tech tree and somehow managed to make the AI factions completely generic and bland. They even managed to make the graphics look really messy and/or blurry in many places. Firaxis had some great new ideas for Beyond Earth, like the new tech tree, the native aliens and the affinities, but sadly those elements are implemented in a non imaginative way with almost catastrophic effects.Beyond Earth is not yet the game we all wanted. It still can become it, after a few expansion packs. A sad way for Firaxis to make money.			",126,29,0,24,19,1,39

												Wow I could hardly wait! Been waiting for months for this game. 1st the positives great graphics great music 9/10. However that being said that is where it stops! Limited game play and usless AIs. The last game I have being playing 2 AIs declared war on me and for over 150 turns I have been trying to make peace with the two of them. There are NO deals to be made. They just say NO over and over and over again. They are at war with other factions but make peace and declare and so on. I have gotten them down to their last two cities but then suddenly they have 20 units that ""appear"" out of nowhere wipe my troops out and then I have to start again. I can not trade as the two of them are in between myself and the other 5 AIs, so I cannot train enough troops to overwhelm the AIs without  them starting to disband as I cannot pay for their upkeep. The one had this Xeno swarm unit that wiped out 10 of my troops in nearly as many moves.  This game looks pretty but then don't judge a book by it's cover. As a single player I give it 2/10 for that load of BS game play. And at that steep price I feel that more than my wallet got ripped off. Wait until Steam offers it as a deal before buying.

												I want to like this game. I loved Civ 5 and for the most part, Beyond Earth plays a lot like it... Which is partially the problem. It plays like Civ 5 with less content and depth.  The new features in the game don't really do enough to make it feel any more than a mod or expansion to Civ 5.There are only 8 factions to choose from, making it impossible to play with anymore than 8 players, even in singleplayer. You can modify the files to allow 8+ AI in singleplayer but it will only result in duplicate factions, rendering diplomacy confusing and practically unusable.The UI is a lot less... informative than Civ 5. Many dulled, grey tones . In particular, telling factions apart on the minimap proves quite difficult with many simply appearing grey. The minimap is also way too small to make out any important details and minor feedback features such as trade route caps and ""just finished building/researching"" information are completely absent.All in all, this game feels more like an unfinished expansion back or a decent mod than a quality civilization title.

												Dear All, IF you buy this, you will have Pandora: First Contact and Alpha Centauri in a Civ 5 DLC. - Unit graphic is different, but evrything else are about the same like in Civ 5. By the way, Pandora and Alpha C. had much more sophisticated unit design. - Trade is 100% the same, just instead of Ivory you have Silica, etc.- Miasma is a kind of xenofungus. Kill your unit similarly to fungus in Pandora: First Contact.- Air unit operations are 100% Civ 5.- Wonders are providing a kind of ""movie"" but nothing fancy- Cities are 100% Civ 5.- There are small twists in the game related to Civ 5, like the research tree is similar to a web, looking like Endless Space research map.- Units get small individual bonus based on experience and general bonus based on affinity that can be researched.- Space layer is coming from Civilisation:Call to Power (Activision, released 10years ago), but with much less freedomSorry to say, but seems that publishers just wanted to get some extra money with minimum effort. I recommend to wait buying this DLC when it will be -25%off in a month. Or buy it around Christmas for -33%.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was a cheap cash-in on civ 5's sucess. Came too soon with no innovation and in some portions far less choice and variation, these lacking areas were supplemented with a less than stellar repetitive quest system and a removal of most victory types favoring almost exclusivly militaristc civs; and when choosing a militaristic play style unit variation has staggeringly halted and taken several steps back. Using not only a astronomically smaller cast the game has instead chosen to integrate its affinity system in giving units upgrades changing their look marginally at best. Though in the end it is your coice, I implore you not to buy this game, to vote with your wallet and stand up against titles such as these.			",29,4,0,14,5,0,21

												I really enjoyed this game, I liked how different it was from traditional Civ games. You can only start in the stone age and build up to modern era so many times before you want something new. I feel this game did a great job of ‘continuing’ the story. It was a bit overwhelming at first since I had no idea what any resources were good for, what were good tiles to expand to, and how to develop my technologies. I love the different biomes you can get with different planets as well, it makes every planet seem unique. If you are a diehard Civ fan I’m not sure if this is the game for you, but if you’re like me and want to experience something different then I totally recommend this game.			",3,2,0,0,4,0,9

												I’ve recently spent a lot of time playing Civ:BE. I think it is my favourite Civ Game so far (haven’t played VI though, so who knows :D). Compared to the others it has not this huuuuuge timespan from stoneage to modern time. CIV:BE starts in the future. Mankind travelled to an alien planet and settles there, hoping to survive far from earth. That worked way better for me, because I always had some problems with this rapid movement through history. So, I tried playing with every starting civilization, liked some better than others – as usual. I went for every possible ending – struggling a lot when I got people from earth to settle on our new planet, because they need lots of space -.-I even tried (for the first time with a Civ game), to get those difficulty achievements. I guess I’m not good enough for that, but it was fun trying it. And in a way a challenge to accept, I can’t do it :]I liked the game. The 87h I’ve spent in it, was mostly fun – not so much after trying difficulty :DI think I even learned quite a bit about the concept for the Civ games, but that’s mostly the case, because I never before tried to get everything done in it. Which I haven’t yet, but it’ll happen. I’m pretty sure. Little side note: The music didn’t go on my nerves even after playing quite some hours. I never turned them off – just turned the volume down, so I won’t stress my cats to much :D ",60,176,0,27,36,2,10

												I was really looking forward to this game, it's a shame it's such a let down. The game feels like it lacks a layer of detail. No advisors, no demographics, no wonder videos. The victory options are all basically the same tech driven ones. There is way too much emphasis on trading. Late game I find myself every turn reconfirming  trade routes. The game just suddenly ended for me with no warning or explanation. I feel like you should have more to do with stations. The AI was attacking a station but you can't threaten or negotiate a cease fire, all stations are good for is a place to send yet another trade vessel. Even just the game UI feels like it lacks detail. No notification of what was just built in a city, or what research was just completed. You don't even see the wonders you built in the city.The aliens just feel like an easier version of barbarians. They didn't attack me until I hit them.Maybe this game will be worth it in another year... ",25,6,0,7,8,0,16

												FIrst of all I've put 180 hrs into this game, and 350 into Civ 5, and I've been playing Civ games since they started being made, so I like to believe this is an informed opinion.If you love sci-fi and love Civilization games, ignore the negative reviews. This game is awesome, it just takes some time getting used to. When I played this game for the first time I felt lost, which I didn't expect after putting 350 hours into Civ 5, expecting this to be just a reskin. The game also felt so flavorless to me just like the negative reviews say, and leaders were without personality.But when I've given the game enough time and started to understand it, I realized I was looking at it the wrong way. The game is not a reskin of Civ 5 unless you want to see it that way, and that's when you'll hate it. There are many layers to the game that gives it its independent personality and lets it walk on its own feet.The biggest thing I'm referring to is afiinities. Affinities are the main pillar this game stands on, and it's the main factor seperating it from Civ 5. Affinities are what give this game its identity and flavor, not leaders. As you progress in each affinity, you get awesome snipets of story unique to each affinity that drives the story forward in a way Civ 5 never could. You start getting awesome unique units, buildings, and even a unique rich-in-story-and-flavor victory condition for each affinity as you tread their paths.There are many other mechanics that make this game cool, like the sattelite layer, interacting with aliens, and artifacts. The tech web, while not beginner-friendly at all, makes for very interesting and diverse choices every single game once you are more familiar with the game.Also the expansion ""Rising Tide"" makes the game even better, and the positive reviews on its Steam page prove that. Such a shame that didn't reflect on the game main page reviews as well.			",463,144,13,71,85,4,126

												I'm big fan of Civilization series... This game, however, is not worth buying.I just might not like psychedelic colors but aliens are fun. And there ends the fun.Tech tree (or rather tech web) is gigantic messy innovation I was never able to navigate through. In contrast with intuitive tech tree from earlier Civilization series... it is just so wrong and annoying... new player in earlier Civilizations is given choice of tech to discover. Not here. Here you have to bother with the whole tech web since first play and first turn.In Civilization V (and IV) we had upgrades and we could focus these upgrades according to battlefield situation. So we can here, we can heal or add 10% strength bonus... and that's it... a joke...Cities have tons of structures, and here is a great idea to upgrade structure via quests, but other than that structures are just a mess to remember, just too many buildings... I could continue but every other game aspect (factions, units, city states...) is similiar: attempt of innovation, alienish look and feel, and definitely messed up.But everything should be forgiven if the game is fun - IT IS NOT:First play is just chaotic, there is no joy from discovering alien world and game mechanics,And there is not much replayability...The one good thing about Beyond the Earth is that you can finally realize that Civilization V was quite OK.

												This game looked cool and I had some high hopes for it, but it seems Firaxis didn't give a ♥♥♥♥ about this one. There's a lot that just simply angers me in this game.To start there's not enough civilizations, and the civilizations only have a single recorded voice line. AI is just far too easy in this game and I'm not even that great in Civ,  this is probably due to being able to win over civilizations by military size or through making them happy by doing certain quests. Which brings me to my next points.Quests, The Tech Tree and Diplomacy.Quests aren't fleshed out enough, and most just feel rushed or last minute attempts to add something else to the game, some seem to be broken or don't make any sense. Although I do like the concept of quests in a Civ game. Moving on to the Tech Tree, this is probably what makes me annoyed the most, it looks very unorganised and just generally all over the place compared to Civ V / VI, I feel like this sort of tree as well could be very confusing for a new player compared to the design used in Civ V / Civ VI.Now talking about Diplomacy, I didn't find it too bad it just felt like they tried something new except it didn't work out. You can use diplomatic points to increase your standing with other civilizations, or you can just choose to lower it and of course go to war. You can also use these points to make agreements with other civilizations but I don't know if it's actually worth doing so yet.I think mainly I just hate the UI in this game along with the fact that it feels empty and not worked on enough. It's good if Firaxis were trying some things but if anything I would've said this is more of a mod/expansion of Civ V than a whole new game. Unfortunately the state of this game has made me lose respect and expectations of what Firaxis will do. So whether I buy Civ VI or not is a tricky one.			",311,76,4,31,32,1,22

												A group of modders could have done a mod for civ 5 in a couple of months that is better than this game. The DLC is overpriced and should have been included as a free download to the buyers of this game. This is basically a reskin of civ 5, the only good addition that I enjoy is the satellites that you can deploy.			",64,20,0,25,50,0,29

												This is a great total conversion mod and I do like the game and enjoy it despite all its problems, but let's face the facts here. It's a good total conversion mod, but it's a total conversion mod for Civ V at best, and not a perfect one at that.I'm still recommending it for fans of the Civilization games. They'll enjoy the science-fiction spin on the series, once they get the hang of this game, and if they can ignore/work around some or most of the game's problems.			",56,3,0,7,6,0,12

												I had heard a lot of complaints about this game and when it was on sale for about $20 including the DLC I picked it up due to my cousin having already bought it when it first came out and he gave it a thumbs up so I bought it.This game may be my favorite Civ game to date, but having only played Civs 3-5 I'll let you guys be the judge of my experience.  That may be considered blasphamy, but I really enjoy this game.  I do enjoy Sci-Fi more than fantasy/medieval type of games though so I fully admit some bias here.  I really liked the tech tree (sorry tech web), in this one.  The web feels daunting at first, yet I enjoy it better than the other Civs.  Mostly because it feels like, no matter what path you choose you don't feel hopelessly outgunned in terms of technology advancement.  Whenever I would play the other ones, if I did it on any higher difficulty level I always felt like my Civilization just figured out gun powder while my cpu compatriots just spliced the atom when I played Civs 3-5.  So maybe I'm just bad at the games.  But the tech web makes me feel like everyone is close to the same level so you can forge your own path without being left behind because you didn't research  a certain tech first and thusly you are way behind.  If you really enjoy Civ 5's tech tree this one could be a bit off putting.I also felt like the game wasn't a drag, you had plenty of places to explore, things you were working toward, but it didn't feel overwhelming.  Maybe Beyond Earth is a bit simpler in that respect, but I personally found that nice.  The AI and companies/civilizations aren't as memorable unfortunately but in a way I also kind of like that better too.  You're an unknown face facing the unknown world leading your people to (hopefully) victory.  I guess I can put myself into the game better than playing as Bismark or etc...I can see the complaints about it being a Civ 5 mod, but the different tech tree/web, the different starting options, and some of the mechanics make me think their complaints are a bit...nit-picky.Anyhow, if you like the other 5 Civ games and the way they work this one may not be as deep or game-changing as you'd expect.  But if you'd like to try something Civ-like but a little different, pick it up on sale with the DLC.			",67,18,1,16,6,1,27

												This is my first real review, but I feel that this game is missunderstood and underappreciated so I hope to improve on that.Beyond Earth is similar to other Civilization franchise games, but different enough to feel fresh. It's like a new game that you already know how to play. With aliens. And lasers.It is not as profound as classic Civ games, but I like the fact that the average game is shorter, with this game a quick skirmish doesn't last weeks. I feel that because of this they removed the cost for upgrading units, changed the evolution tree and made affinities...Without the DLC the game feels like it is lacking, but with the Rising Tide complexity rises considerably; I adore the new hybrid affinities, the new diplomacy is ok, personality traits are awesome. Connection to Sid Meier's Starship is also a neat bonus, ehich enhances immersity in the game universe.It also runs well on non-gaming laptops and steam cloud save works seamlessly; to me this is of a paramount importance, because I like to play it on my gaming PC as well on my laptop.A Steam controller is almost a must have for Civilization games, after a quick personalization it makes everything so much quicker and effortless...The main CON of this game is it's full price. If Beyond Earth, Rising Tide and Sid Meier's Starship came on the market as one complete game I feel it would get the praise it rightfully deserves. With it's current marketing system...well...buy it on sale, as have I.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One month since release, yet they haven't even fixed the most glaring issues with a patch or hotfix, instead they say they are developing a major patch. Well, guess what, you still can't play the game on a >60 Hz monitor in normal resolutions in fullscreen (biggest it let's me select is 1300something to 800something), achievements don't work properly in multiplayer (and multiplayer doesn't run stable at all).Other, decent developers, would've release a hotfix one or two days after release at the latest!I'm not even gonna comment on the game much here, even though I will say that it feels VERY barebore at this point (only 8 factions, victory types are extremely boring etc), but their release/patching policy is disgraceful! If I hadn't been gifted this game by a friend, I would've already asked for a refund at this point and I can only urge others to actually do it, to send the message that this behaviour from a developer will not be tolerated! I used to like Firaxis, they're one of the few studios, who make games in one of my favourite and under-representated genre (turn-based strategy that is), but this release again only confirms: DON'T BUY THEIR GAMES ANYWHERE NEAR RELEASE!Pathetic, Firaxis and 2k, shame on you!

												This is a fully functional game, would I buy it after I tried it? No..If you are looking for a game in this genre, go for Civilization V instead.This game seems to be very inbalanced.. Not proberly tested before release and some stupid functionality issues such as troops can go into fog of war, and instead of stopping when an enemy is on the tile just makes a sucide attack.Trade seems to be everything, first trade vessel doubled my science output. Later in the game is stands for 2/3 of my science.I stopped building things in my cities and instead just bought everything. one spy attempt to steal gold gives enough resources to easily do that.I started to establish outpost just to have more trade vessels. First thing you did was to buy every building and then put them on research production or culture or whatever you want, truth is.. It really dosen't matter.There is very little feeling of progress overall.. and have none of that feeling of, just one more turn!If you have played a lot of games in this genre, don't get this one..I will hope for an update patch were they revamp mostly everything. If they do I might come back and edit this review.Shame on you for this...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I always liked playing ""Expand and kill"" in civilization, this game out of its way to prevent that.You can no longer ""keep playing"" after someone wins one of the goals, you can't even turn off the goals and play in global domination mode.Defending is to easy, all you need is a couple of units outside the city the AI is attacking and you're set for the game's length. Most games just end in a defence stalemate.Attacking a city is near impossible unless you've out teched the enemy.Enemy spies can take over your cities unless you tech exactly the right things, dictating the options in the tech tree at the beginning.The tech tree makes no sense, it doesn't empower you to find out what to chose next, it becomes mostly a random clickfest, and if you make the wrong choices you lost the game even though you might not know it yet.The miasma play's like the nuclear waste in CIV2 that you always had to pick up, its annoying and doesn't add any fun.All in all I think this is a pretty bad Civilization release, I'm more tempted to start a game of CIV 4 than to continue playing.

												Civilization: Beyond Earth is a fresh new take on the CIV game series. While it may not be as addicting as it's predecessors, it's still a good game.Pros+ It's fresh. It's a nice change from the other games.+ The affinity system is a nice addition. Mix with the aliens or exterminate them?+ Upgrading your units in this game is a more fleshed out experince.+ Cool units, buildings and wonders.+ Multiplayer is pretty stable from what I've seen, less buggy than CIV V.Cons- It's just not as addicting. I can see myself putting around another twenty or so hours into this game. I have over 250 in CIV V and I imagine that will reach 300 hours eventually.- The leaders are not unique and are just aren't interesting. Part of the fun of CIV is playing as historical leaders through history, not random characters who you don't care for.- UI can be confusing at times.- Also, not enough leaders. I do like the game, I do, but it just isn't as good as other games in the series. I may one day buy the High Tides DLC, but if not I can't see myself interacting with this game for much more than twenty or so hours, which is tiny compared to CIV V.I would give this game a 6/10, and would say it's worth buying when it's around £10.

												This is not a spiritual successor to Alpha Centauri. This is a thematic re-versioning of Civilization 5, with the same core mechanics, a change of vocabulary here and there, fantastical rather than scientific or philosophical explanations of new technology and research items, less voice over work, less dramatic score, no narrative progression or character progression, no sense of exploring a new planet and building a new civilization etc.One of the dumbest mistake in the game has to be the setting. You leave earth and resettle in a new solar system in a new planet with EXACTLY the same civilization you left earth in. For example, the factions you are rebuilding in this new planet could be from australia, asia, europe or others (the names has been altered somewhat) segregated by geography on earth rather than idealogy, thus effectively making the backstory something like ""earth is decimated and its people has to leave the planet to inhibit a new planet all together even though we are are flying off in different rockets just so we can continue our discord and differences in a the exact same alien planet even though theres clearly many different choice of inhabitable destination..."" Why not fly off in ONE rocket, to inhibit a new planet as a HUMAN RACE, while exploring and carving out our SURVIVOR in a new planet with alien intelligent lifeform? Why fly to a new planet just to continue what we are doing on earth? Its like if North Korea says ""oh hey, the americans chose THAT planet to settle in. Lets spend billions of dollars, fly light years to that same planet at the risk of our entire nation and continue our nuclear threat on them just to♥♥♥♥♥♥them off for eternity!""  Well, with a flawed logic like that to start off with, I just couldnt get myself to believe that I was humanity's last hope in a new planet, the game falls quite flat in most ways since you are essentially just playing civilization on a new map, with new wordings and the occasional alien lifeforms to battle with. Sure, its still fun as a game but compared to Alpha Centauri, its science fiction story is too stale and common with little new ideas and compared to CIV 5 Brave New World, its just not as robust.If you look beyond the new sheen and wordings, its really just a gimmicky rehash of CIV 5. If your a REALLY SERIOUS science buff (and not just science FICTION buff), then its really dissapointing because the subject matter intrinsically hold alot of potential for the stephen hawkings kind of cerebral approach. As a narrative its not Asimov, its more like some high school level science fiction story. I say this with a weary heart, as I grey up playing Civ 1 - 5 and almost all of sid meiers games for the last 25 years and loved every moment of those earlier games....			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Civilization: Beyond Earth is a very difficult game to summarise.This is a franchise I have followed for a long time and Civilization V is a game I've spent nearly 500hrs playing. On the one hand it is an extremely enjoyable game and some of the new gameplay systems - the tech web, aliens, enhanced espionage and quests - provide a lot of depth; on the other the game lacks contextual relevance, with technologies, wonders and leaders coming across as rather bland.This is a game I expect to see develop with the release of content patches and expansions. Obvious areas to overhaul would be the satellite system (which is currently overly gimmicky and tedious), the tech tree (it has variety but it's hard to get a sense of what to research for a balanced game) and sponsors (previously called Civs, they are few in number and extremely shallow). The interface is rather lacking, with buildings and wonders using a monotone colour scheme making it extremely difficult to see at a glance what you're constructing and what you should research.However, there is a lot that the game gets right. The new expansion system - whereby you must create an outpost and wait for it to expand to become a city - means that you have to be more strategic with your city placement and defence; the quest system allows you to shape the game around your play style; the espionage system allows for capturing cities and requires you to monitor your own cities; wonders are better balanced, as the tech web means players can focus on different areas with less overlap; happiness has been replaced with health and is no longer as punishing, as well as providing rewards for higher amounts.Those with an open mind and an interest in strategy games will love this. Those extremely attached to previous versions or hoping for a straight remake of Alpha Centauri will be left wanting.Any true Civ fan owes it to themselves to get this and give it a proper go.

Solid foundation with some questionable additions // Recommended for fans of the series+ The 'one more turn' mentality is still present in full force+ Indigenous wildlife boasts much more of a challenge, of a variety, and of a better collective design than barbarians of the previous installments+ Combat against cities and units is as well-implemented and satisfying as ever; the audio design and smooth animations make for a very fulfilling experience+ Upgrades are free of resources requirements and are universally applied amongst all units of that type; does well to eliminate the need to hunt down and manage obsolete units+ Research tree is vastly improved; it can be daunting at first, but the superiority of this system comes through on subsequent playthroughs (once the player is more familiar with the 'branches and leaves' and what they unlock)+ The three possible affinities are a welcome addition and do much to offer great variety and customization in the mid- to late-game+ 'Favors' are a very welcome concept, and work perfectly to improve productivity of player-AI interactions and general diplomacy+ Sleek, aesthetically pleasing, and functional UI+ Effortless and rewarding to experiment with mods through the Steam workshop+ Satellites are a welcome addition, adding another layer of possible resource buffs to the game without cluttering the map+ Stunning environment designs; flora and resources really stand out in beautiful and creative ways+ Espionage and trade work in largely the same ways as in Civ V, with some minor improvements- Culture is now an empty and lifeless statistic in the absence of art, musicians, etc.- Confusing loss of custom game modifiers as compared to the previous installment of the series- Steep learning curve, mostly due to alien and unfamiliar terrain features- Finishing a game is underwhelming, and does little to reward the player, especially compared to previous installments- Health, as a resource, seems to be a slightly poorer implementation than the happiness of Civ V, and feels unreasonably difficult to manage effectively- There are no more natural wonders to be found, taking a bit of fun and reward out of exploration- Quests are boring and repetitive; they do little to add to the game's dimensions- The available factions feel somewhat bland and uninteresting- There are no faction-specific units; the only difference between factions lies in the starting bonuses- AI have almost no aggression factor whatsoever, even into upper middling levels of difficultyLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit ",195,26,1,22,22,0,22

It was clear that they just took the Civ 5 base and then modded it, even a lot of the textures are the same as in the old game.

												This is an enjoyable game if you're already a Civ fanatic, but others are unlikely to enjoy.The game is very dense, and puts a fair amount of 'burden of knowledge' on players, i.e. the amount of unique information points in the game.  Civilization I-V have this problem as well, but they're able to cheat and alleviate it somewhat because of the fact that the game is based on the real world - I have some intuitive understanding that grassland or plains is better than snow or desert, I understand that a tank is going to beat a horse-mounted knight, I have some grasp on what the Iron or Gold resource might do for my empire, etc.  I know what the ""farm"" tile improvement is for.Beyond Earth has little of that - one terrain type is visually indistinguishable from another, it can be difficult to tell exactly what unit you're facing, etc.  There is a lot more to take in, and it isn't communicated as visually as it could be to the player.  There's a lot of mousing over and reading tool tips and not a lot of knowing at a glance.The game is devoid of personality.  Your mileage may vary, but after sinking a lot of hours into it, I just don't see anything endearing in Beyond Earth as compared to Civ V.  The sponsors just aren't memorable, and don't feel unique.  The flavor text that goes along with the tech tree just doesn't pack the same charm.The game isn't well balanced - I was able to jump from the easiest to the most difficult setting (Apollo) with no problem when I realized how easy it was for spies to take an AI capital via coup - domination victory by turn 100 every time.  There are a lot of choices in the game - affinity, sponsor, starting load out, etc - but because one choice is always the clearly superior option, they aren't interesting.  There aren't multiple ways to play so much as a right and a wrong way to play.As many people have noted, the hyped aliens are just barbarians with a few more units and higher strength rating - In nearly 80 hours of play, winning as every leader on every map type across every difficulty setting - I can say there was never a point where the aliens were even remotely a factor in my play.  This feature falls totally flat.All that being said, if you love Civ, or just 4X in general, I do think there is a likable game here, and I would recommend you purchase it if that is the case.  But this isn't Alpha Centauri 2, and with Firaxis having apparently already moved on to new products, the prospects of this game being ""fixed"" by expansion packs the way Civ V was seem bleak, so the majority of players should take a pass here.

												I give it a solid ""5""  I disagree that is is simply ""Civ 5 re-skinned"" and really enjoy some of the new concepts and mechanics but Alpha Centauri it is not.  Gameply isn't streamlined and after a time, you'll find yourself irritated at the turn sequence.  Combat is badly in need of balancing and the various factions really need more depth; perhaps unique units or unit enhancements. They all feel pretty much the same.The health mechanic (aka ""happiness"") seems broken as well.  As your empire expands it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain a ""healthy"" empire.  You can mitigate this by choosing nearly every quest choice to go in that direction which then begs the question, ""why have the other choices?""  It needs balancing.On that topic, the quests are a nice idea but being given a choice of quests would be better.  As it stands, you get some significant bonuses for completing them but will fail them if not completed in time meaning your game choices are a lot more linear if you want the benefit.In a word, the game quickly becomes - boring....All in all, a disappointment.  Fixable; certainly but it remains to be seen how it is approached.  I expect that there will be enough negativity out there to prompt some action.I have yet to run the Mantle verson of the game which I was excited to see, as I have a R9 series AMD card.  It crashes, displays on the wrong monitor and doesn't allow me to interact with the software when running.  I have had to quit out of it. I'm sure I get it to run but have not had the desire so far to tweak with it.  I note a number of people having issues with it so maybe some more testing would have been in order.On the subject of playtesting - Had this been given to a number of long-term Civ/AC fanes to test, I have to believe a lot of the shortcomings would have been quickly apparent.  Did I mention I am disappointed?  I have been a big fan of Sid games back to the orginal Civ (DOS Version) and the Microprose days.  The orginal Civ is widely believed to be one of the most important games of all time; establishing a genre.  This game isn't even close.			",78,21,0,39,4,0,24

												Having played nearly all of Sid Meier's games, I've come to appreciate the innovation and complexity that each new release brings. However, this one falls short. All of the previews and magazine and website reviews hyped this up. While some of the additions are nice, such as the tech web, other key components of previous civ games have been neglected, or feel like they've just been ignored. There isn't enough ""new"" in this game to warrant it being a standalone Civ. Where the past Civ games have felt like a true step up and forward with each release, this is a half-step at best. In the end, this is a fun game, but it feels like a piece of DLC for Civ 5, not a new, standalone, breakout game. Please do not buy this game at full price, you will regret it, like I have.

												I never had high expectations from Civ:BE (this is the first Civ game I've owned and played). I didn't pay $50 for it either; instead I got it pretty cheap, somewhere around $15 (Indian retail copy). It's worth the money considering what I paid for it. As far as the game is considered, it lost its charm after a few replays. The gameplay does get very monotonous, also, it's the same thing (progression) over and over again.I can't recommend getting the game in its current state, maybe wait for some DLCs or get this during a sale or both.

												Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth? More like Sh*t Meier's Sh*tilization: Beyond a Sh*tty F*cking Game. This is the worst game I have ever played. The fact that it was released at a $50 pricetag is a crime against humanity. Every single aspect is a failure. Boring, lifeless factions. Awful gameplay. You will be confirming trade routes 90% of the time. Combat unit strength feels extremely unbalanced and units become obsolete very quickly. Wonders in this game are nothing more than a joke. I remember there was one late game wonder that took or so 40 turns to complete, and then gave +1 food? No interesting dyamics, and an inconsequential effect. Win conditions are tedious and boring. Want to build 40 of the same unit? I know I don't. But if you do, congratulations, you can now look at this static 'you win' screen, leave the game, and play again! The game is also a graphics hog. Everything lags so much even on the lowest settings on my Asus G75. It's like they forgot to test this game at all. The new mechanics that were introduced, miasma and aliens, are simply nuisances that the player is forced to spend time to remove. It's like, here, we're going to stymie your progress until you buy this unit and get this building. It's not fun, and is absolutely a chore. You know what though? It's worse than a chore. I'd rather get up in the middle of the game and do the dishes than play this game. It's not even a game. It's a scam. It's 0/10 trash appended with the names Sid Meier and Civilization to trick suckers like myself and many others into buying it. I am writing this review to warn you not to be one of those suckers. And what's certain to come next is numerous patches and DLC to milk more money out of the poor souls who were tricked into buying this. Please, never, ever think about playing this game. Avoid supporting this garbage.			",20,7,1,6,4,1,9

												I'm not going to lie, after seeing some reviews of this game, and comparing it to Civ V, I was not thrilled by it. But this free weekend has allowed me to experience Beyond Earth for myself, and I was actually quite impressed! My only point, is that this would be better suited as a higher-priced DLC for Civ V, as it runs off of most of the same features.They have made a lot of improvements to the old Civ V to make it seem quite different, and they have added some completely new features which add to the enjoyability of the game. Sure, it may not be AS GOOD AS Civ V, but we have to wait. Civ V became so much better with the arrival of DLC, especially Brave New World. This game shows so much promise and with DLC it could be loads better than it already is.Positives:All of the improvements to Civ V (inc. Tech Web and City States)New factions to play as and starting bonuses are a nice touch, giving each player the chance to be equal to another, so there are no over-powered factions.Generally fun gameplay. I enjoyed played single and multiplayer, the features are largely the same as Civ V so I could adapt quickly to understand and enjoy the new features.Negatives:The colour scheme. It's so dark and, I suppose, dank. There aren't any vibrant colours which stand out and it makes the game feel glum and morose. I hope a DLC can change the colour scheme, such as Brave New World did for Civ V.			",57,11,0,8,4,1,3

												Was desperately hoping the franchise would learn from CIv V's successes/blunders and improve upon it's playability with this new release...However, as it currently stands I can't give this game my endorsement.- the online play is prone to constant crashes.- demographics are more vague than ever and access to strategic information is lacking, glitchy or non-accessible.- the trading post (CS equivilant to civ V) is almost pointless. They lack depth, resources and are an in general a nuisance with unchecked faults. [can't declare war on them with a ranged unit to give an example]- the intrigue from spying is interesting, but I ended up with more spies than cities I could place them in. They only let you place a spy in someone's capital and not their other cities.This game is new so this is an early review and I just needed to vent my frustrations.I LOVE Civ V and hope they can raise the bar with this series to an equal if not better level. Until they can fix what looks to be an obvious rush-to-release job with this game I would reccomend waiting.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Essentially a different skin for Civ 5 without expansions, lacking polish and personality. Do not buy.Due to the way the faction generation and affinity system works, all factions and leaders end up being completely generic, other than the ethnicity of their leaders, which is a lot less interesting than developed characters characterized by their ideologies. Tech-tree falls completely flat as generic baseline sci-fi, lacking the interesting speculation into the development of future technology that was present in Alpha Centauri, and and the combination of the two above factors makes all the tech-quotes completely uninteresting. There aren't even cutscenes for Wonders or Victory conditions. The one saving grace is the quest system, but even that could have been handled better and less predictably (Like the quest system in the Fall from Heaven mod series for Civilization 4).In the end it just feels like a board-game. If that's what you're after, fair enough, but if you an actually good sci-fi game, go on GOG and get Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri. Or get the Planetfall mod for Civ 4.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Disappointing! - Sid Meier is a guru of strategic depth and balance vs. fun factor. This game does not feel like a Sid game. It feels like a corporate fiasco, rushed to the market, incomplete, overpriced, simplified to allow for more expansions and more dollars. Stay away from it and let's see if Firaxis will have the decency to fix this without a $30 dollar price tag xpack. Its a step back from Civ V even in simple things like UI and Civilopedia. Mechanics are watered down... Religions are gone, world congress is gone, deep city specialization and great people gone, tall empires - gone.What's left? A broken, infinite city sprawl only strategy supported by difficult to manage OP trade routes.Sorry guys, I really wanted to love this, I'm a major fan of Sid Meier and the Civ franchaise, played every game they ever made (anyone remember ""Railroads!""?), loved them all, except this... Its a sad sad day today.   ",36,5,0,13,16,0,26

												Right, after fifty hours of gameplay, I'll get straigt to the point with Pros, Cons and Misc notes on this gamePros:-Decent Graphics-Good mechanics-Good art work-Great soundtrack-Nice pallet of unitsCons:-Needs a bit more content-Interface needs some work-AI needs to be a bit better educated and more active and stop porposing crappy dealsMisc:-No nukes (Wish they explained why)-Not Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri-Want to see this universe expandNotes: -In my heart, this isn't a Alpha Centauri spiritual successor, it doesn't have the distrubing undertones, infact it is something else, it shows more of a hopeful future for mankind in the stars.-Seriously people should really look at Civ V pre DLC, it had even less content than BE-For recommendations about this game... For new to the genre or even the civilizations series, yes I do recommend it, but for us veteran players... Well, wait till there's DLC to beef up this game a bit, though it still can be enjoyable.

												I was really excited about this game after playing and loving Civ 5. In my opinion, this should be a mod for civ 5, not it's own standalone game.. It's civ 5 - in space with aliens. Those are really the only differences.It's still a pretty fun game, but I can not justify paying a $50 price tag for a $15-20 (what should be) mod of a game.I played this for free weekend, so I did not have to buy it - and i'm glad that I held off on it. I will buy it when it gets under $20 probably for an alternative to civ 5, but the current price is not justified and i would not recommend buying it at this price.			",903,363,51,109,134,9,141

												At first I hated this game, then I loved it, then I hated it.All Civ:BE is, is basically the base Civ5 (no mods or DLCs) with a Sci-Fi twist to it. Essentially Civ:BE feels like a scenario in Civ5. It has some new unique features.. Hardly worth a mention.I can recommend it, on the other hand.. No, save your money and get something worth the value. I highly recommend Endless Legend opposed to this if you're looking for a similar Sci-Fi game, a million times better. Or just get CivV. Just don't buy this for $40 whatever you do. $10 is a more reasonable price for the content.			",52,3,0,13,8,0,15

With all of that said its still a nice game probably 7/10 but I´ll stick with Civ5  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A colossal disappointment. As a huge fan of Civ V, I cannot really recommend this game to anyone that is a fan of that game, as all you're really going to get is a re-skin of the same game, in space. It still retains much of the headaches of Civ V, and creates new ones. Victory conditions are long, drawn out and dull. Faction leaders are lifeless random schmucks with zero personality. The AI is abysmal and still cannot figure out how to play. The tech web is a massive disappointment after you realize that every game, you're essentially going to learn everything with an affinity boost to create your victory condition. Unit upgrades are basically cosmetic in nature and each affinity is nothing more than a ""victory condition"" and cosemetic change.Everything about this game just seems rushed out the door, and very half-hearted. There is quite a bit wrong with this game that I could go on and on about, but really there is no need. Beyond Earth is a let down in every possible way.**Edit 10/30/14** I'm still putting time into this game despite my negative review and first impressions. I'm also digging deeply into the game to find some qualities that I actually like. I'm having a really hard time finding them, but I think this game does have potential to become good...it's just going to take two major patches and some DLC...or user content.Affinities need work, and research, again like Civ V: BNW, is the most important resource. Now that your ""affinity"" is directly tied to research instead of your actual actions on the planet, stacking science is again the main strategy for every game. Making Affinities tied to actions, reactions, quests and how you actually handle the aliens and landscape could possibly be patched in, and I think that would go a very long way to making this game a bit more robust. Affinity unit upgrades should also be more than just cosmetic in nature. I feel like just becuase I have the third Tier Supremacy Tank, that it's no different than the third tier Harmony tank other than visual design. Their stats are identical, and the bonus you pick every level is pretty much the same, or so minor it doesn't even make a difference. These units need to become more unique per Affinity.**Edit 12/9/14**First major patch was released so I'm eager to see how the game plays now, but from reading the notes they still have not addressed the main issues with the game. Depite their work, Affinities are still just tied to stacking beakers, so every game is essentially the same. The only way Beyond Earth is really going to be fixed is re-working the Affinity system entirely.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For anyone totally new to any kind of CIV game who likes sc-fi themes, I can recommend it when it goes on a sale.It is a very solid complex turn-based strategy game which offers different kind of winning conditions. If you don't read guides and etc, this game will offer you hundreds of hours of fun trying to find out what is best under different circumstances. You progress and keep progressing by learning from your mistakes on different difficulty levels. This stands apart from the sci-fi theme which you can like or, like me, dislike.However...Build on the CIV 5 engine and the 100 turns pre-release video you'd expect this game to be CIV 5 in a different theme. A reskined and renamed game. And pretty much that's it! It is easy to relate resources, textures and names back to what they are in CIV 5. Really a somewhat 1:1 copy. I wonder how long it takes before workshop items appear that restores all to what they are called and look like in CIV 5.As BE is being sold as a stand alone game and not as an expansion package to CIV 5, you'd expect the game to progress in terms of bug fixes, system resource hungryness, gameplay and etc. But no progression on that.Random events are back from CIV 4 (or was that a mod?) and is the only additional thing. You can choose between two benefitting event options and that is the only gameplay that has been added in comparison to CIV 5. They claim to have worked on the multiplayer part, but it functions just as bad as CIV 5. Resync in turn 1, free techs being given to your opponents... Sad enough it is build on the same engine as CIV 5, but they removed the dx9 and touchscreen executable. Dx9 offered way less desync issues while playing multiplayer and the touchscreen executable in CIV 5 let you play the game without the game crashing while touching the screen.On the other hand they added mantle support to improve multicore performance, but hell i prefer a better functional product above mantle or a dx12 low level kind of api support.Looking further into the game there is some unbalance, unfinished work or too cheap reskinning ruining the gameplay.Playing on marathon in turn 75 ~ 150 and I have to put my city production to work on energy or research as I already literally build every building that I researched. This is the first time in a CIV game that I can't build anything anymore in a city so early in the game. Ofcourse I can put effort in researching tech so I can build more buildings, but w00t so early in the game and nothing to do.The cityproduction advisor tells me to build a building which improves the energy (gold for civ 5) output by +1 for each desert tile. But, I don't have a single desert tile anywhere near any of my cities so this building is going to cost me energy for each turn instead?Than the developpers crafted some awesome tile add-on called miasma (a marsh for civ 5) which gives you negative health for each turn you stand on it. By researching the correct stuff you can regain health when standing on it. A very neath idea, BUT... they did not change the code of the AI players when attacking defending. The AI idles in miasma losing health or attacks you from out miama... If they declare war you can just do totally nothing and wait for them to die in miasma!They should have made this an expansion to CIV 5, should have worked on the multiplayer desyncs and should have added mantle support to CIV 5 instead of this unlogic split. As a standalone BE is standing in the shade of CIV 5 as it offers less content, more unbalance and the very same bugs that CIV 5 today offers.			",228,40,15,26,38,3,45

												I'm going to make this review simple and short.  1. A modder could of done this. You most likely heard it before now you're going to hear it again. The features that the game have added are little and insignificant. They even take some features out like Luxury recourses.  Quest one of the new features. Most are just killing 10 aliens, building some kind of building, getting resource pods or excavations. You get a choice usually when you build a building. All it is a chose of one befit or another. Like +1 Health (Happiness) or 1+ Energy(Gold)  Orbital Layer is nothing but lunching a satellite that you wont see very much over a piece of land with give some kind of benefit in a AOE/AOI (Area of effect, Area of influence). Nothing all that special.   There is only a very small number of units. With only upgrade with your Affinities.   Affinities give bonuses and buffs. These act like you ideologies.  There is now favors which the AI will give you when they want something you have and they don't have or don't want to trade something for it. You can then trade them in for Energy, recourses, etc...  2. Bugs, bugs everywhere. They are so many bug that I can even begin to list them out. It could easily take up this hole review.   Here's a couple, some Aliens turning invisible when attacked, and then making the Attacking animation take a very long time while you look at nothing. Quest bugged, Crashing at start up.  3. Hello, Do you have a Sweet kickass Gaming monitor that can do more then 60hz?   WELL THEN YOU PLAY AT 1280x1024! Oh yea. If you have a high Refresh rate you have to play at 1280x1024! Or you can play in window mode. NO! NOT BORDERLESS Window mode. Window mode. It's been TWO WEEKS since launch, and still no hot fix for it. They don't care. How does this make it pass play testers?  4. Do you have out dated computer that meets recommended  System Requirements with room to spare? You will get a Weird rainbow box pattern Graphical Glitch on the land when you load up a save file, or at random. This supposedly has to do with older GPUs. Even if you meet the recommended  System Requirements.  5. AI is still on the brain dead and weak side, or even worst. The AI never really talked to me or even went to war with each over. Maybe 2-3 time and they were very short.   6. No personality in this game. Factions are bland, have no personality. They nothing different with them other than a bonuses, a color and a flag. They might as well have called them by colors of the rainbow. This game tries to tell a story with some special quest and the victories., but fails hard.  Theres rumors that some features have been taken out of the game to be later resold to you as a DLC.  There isn't enough here to be anything that great. At the time of writing this I have 10.0 in this game. At about turn 200 I got so bored with this game that I did every thing I could just to my victory as fast as I could so i could end this game. Going through turns as fast I can. I still haven't finished my game.I wouldn't say walk away from this game, I would say Run!Update 2/2/15: I thought i would just give a little update about how this game has progressed. It took them a month and a half to fix their game, yet that patch even broke the game for a lot of people. That inexcusable for a AAA Dev. Most Dev have a patch within a week to fix the big bugs, and then patch the rest ASAP. It's been about 3 and a half months and there is still many bugs that haven't been fixed. Firaxis Games has been very silent on what's going on. No one knows what they're doing, or even how long it could be for a partch, if they're even working on one. Please don't listen to the Fanboyism. They will defend their purchase, and their favorite Dev, to the very last drop of blood!			",186,28,5,30,46,2,81

												Played Civ 2, 3, and 4 extensively. I was really excited about this game and the scifi theme, but really disappointed once I downloaded and played it. There seem to be a lot of bugs related to the loading and startup, where it just sits on the title screen with no indication of if it's locked up or taking a long time to load. The UI and color scheme make it very difficult to figure out what is going on, and several quests are broken. I'll try it again after some patches, but right now I just feel like I wasted my money.

YouTube™ Video: Should You Buy Civilization Beyond Earth? A 3 Minute Civ BE Review 

			Views: 417		

			Civilization 5 was one of the greatest games ever made, roughly 3 months after it was actually released that is. It was a game that became better and better over time.		

It would not take much for a modder to create a replica of this game in CIvilization 5.  Unfortuantely it offers less in the ways of content and less in the ways of gameplay over Civ 5.  It lacks the character and spirit that made Civ series great.			",209,51,5,37,42,1,60

There is a lot of new stuff to be seen in BE, including a few features that I would love to see in Civilization proper, such as Quests, Orbital, and a non linear progression. However, many of the bugs that were in the Civ 5 engine come along through space here too.Early game is perhaps the best part of the game. You start off alone and weak, hoping to not anger the planet as you explore and get your feet wet. However the longer you play, the more you come to realize the blandness of the game. Quests are there, but they tend to only play a minor part of the game as a whole. You end up feeling you have a lot to do, but none of it really matters. The AI is some of the dumbest ive ever seen in a Civ game. They almost never directly confront you, and even if they decide to war against you, they wont do anything with it. TL:DR Nice concept, but feels hollow and empty. It has the makings of greatness, but for now, it is just mediocre.			",303,92,10,38,50,6,65

												I wish I liked this better. I wanted to like this better. I made myself keep playing even after I had the sinking feeling that I didn't like this better. It's just not very good, and I say that as a gamer with a broad tolerance range and a willingness to find something to like in most designs. There just isn't much here to praise even with a generous eye. When the gameplay is decent, that's because it's essentially re-skinned Civilization V. The tech web is really the only innovation that changes Civilization V's core design in some intriguing ways.Otherwise, this is totally lacking in polish, in meaningful iterations of Civ V's designs, in anything that would give it one-more-turn attractiveness. The factions are dull and uninvolving, which I think explains why the designers were so eager to discourage comparisons between Beyond Earth and Alpha Centauri. The aliens are just pointless nuisances rather than a major, interesting wrinkle in the Civ formula. The game could barely give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about building Wonders--they get no description and their impact is buried under their incremental bonuses. The interesting endgame units often don't even come into play. The AI is fairly bad, though that's not exactly unique to this installment in the Civ series. The end of the game just sort of happens without fanfare. The whole thing feels amateurish and underimagined, like the job was shoved at some interns. Civ V was underwhelming at launch too, but this has a much longer way to go before it's any good. I'm not sure that it even can be made good, compared to what was done with Civ V.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Civilization: Beyond Earth is a good game when looked at in isolation. The problem with Civilization: Beyond Earth is that it will be compared in one of two ways by almost anyone who plays it, one of which is a unflattering comparison to a huge degree:1: Against Alpha Centauri (not really a fair comparison in many ways, but understandable given that this is a sci-fi setting)2: Against Civilization V (an incredibly fair comparison, since much is reused from Civ V and a majority of players probably owned Civ V before getting Civ:BE).Now, let's deal with the first comparison: Alpha Centauri came out a long ways ago, pre-dates the game that Civ:BE is based on (Civ V) by a good number of years, and Civ:BE clearly was not going to have the same mechanics as Alpha Centauri. So, what's left to even draw a comparison to? Well, the sci-fi setting. Believe me, there are issues with Civ:BE, as I'll get into, but the comparison with Alpha Centauri is mostly not a fair one. That said, passing mention in interviews with those working on Civ:BE was made that Civ:BE would be a sort of 'spiritual successor' to Alpha Centauri, which may be true in one sense but in another sense was only going to encourage comparisons to AC despite the games being rather unrelated.But the big, fatal flaw with Civilization: Beyond Earth is that it fails in every conceivable way when compared to Civilization V. First of all, if you own Civ V with all the DLC, then you have the classic 'Civilization Sequel' problem of every Civ sequel having none of the DLC features of the game prior. Even Civ V launched without religion, which, actually now that I think about it, was a standard feature at launch of Civ IV. But what saved sequels in the past was that new mechanics were brought in that couldn't be added in another expansion: in Civ V, we have 1UPT (1 combat unit per turn), among other things, which really changes combat. But then we have Civilization: Beyond Earth, and whether you call it a sequel or a spin-off, it's still the next Civ game to come out. And it does virtually everything Civ V did, with a few minor tweaks, a less-linear tech tree (that still has distinct paths for certain strategies anyways), and way less content.If you already own Civ V and all its DLC, you have almost everything in Civ V as well as a bunch of things Civ:BE got rid of. Civ:BE eliminated different air-unit types... there's only one air unit now, which has branching upgrades that give you a choice of an ability. That's it. No bombers. No fighters. Just one basic unit. Civ:BE also back-tracked to having no melee naval units. Civ:BE also has no unique music (all music plays for all sponsors). Civ:BE also lacks unique units (no sponsor has any units that the others can't also get). Civ:BE also lacks artistic details for leader screens (very minimalistic  indeed).Add all that to the already in-grained issue of every new Civ game losing some features from the previous games, and you have a really good game that is virtually identical to the last one that probably a majority of prospective buyers already own.Even 'new' features are not all that new: aliens are barbarians with a tiered system of aggression... affinities are basically an extension of the tech system since most affinity levels come through teching and not quests...  the tech web itself still plays out in a way where you will bee-line key techs and follow several linear paths. In fact, the tech web most-of-all is a let-down, because it's really just a different-looking tech tree you already saw in Civ V. To be fair, there are fewer pre-requisite techs for bee-lining certain things, but the new lay-out is not as different from Civ V, strategy-wise, as you might first suspect.In the end, Civ:BE is a really good game... but is one that is likely to irritate its purchasers, as a large chunk will compare it to Alpha Centauri despite the two games being quite different, while an even bigger chunk will look at it and find it to be far less immersive than Civ V and drastically lacking in content *even before factoring in DLCs*. That's right, Civ:BE is one of the first Civ games in a long time that is virtually no better than the vanilla game before it (and Civ V vanilla wasn't even all that good). Which is ironic given that Civ:BE does incorporate some elements from Civ V's expansions (trade-routes, for one). I can't recommend Civ:BE. It's just too much like Civ V, which with all its DLC is not significantly more expensive than Civ:BE. I can easily recommend getting Civ V, but not Civ:BE. In an alternate universe where Civ V does not exist, maybe then. But the fact is that Civ V exists and does everything better, especially the artisic elements. Don't get me wrong: I like Civ:BE and will continue to play it. But not nearly like I played Civ V, because Civ V came out first and was a better game right-out-of-the-box in terms of interface and presentation. And even content-wise, Civ V had far more interesting unique elements for the civilizations than we'll probably ever see in Civ:BE.			",55,3,0,14,18,2,32

												Game seriously lacks polish - even compared to vanilla Civ V.Terrain looks worse and with less variation. There is very little leader dialogue and the quality of the flavour text is variable - it's no Alpha Centuri. Diplomacy and the AI has been copypasted from Civ V. Game needs a balance patch as well - covert ops and trade routes are crazy strong. There isn't a lot to distinguish the affinities/civs in terms of gameplay. The stations, quest system and aliens are cool additions but don't redeem the core gameplay. The game just feels like a mod for Civ V. Don't get me wrong I loved Civ V - I beat the game on Deity and have spent endless hours with my mates in multiplayer - but Beyond Earth isn't there yet. Save your dosh and buy it after the expansions. Maybe have a look at Endless Legend instead.  ",101,20,3,13,10,2,30

												I hate to pile on, but this game deserves it.  I'm a long time fan of the Civilization, going back to Civ I on the Atari ST.  This is by far the worst of a great franchise.  It isn't a horrible game - nothing like M003, but it isn't really worthy of the Civ, or Sid Meier, moniker either.  It is very lack lustre and lacks the famous, ""just one more turn"" digital-crack addiction of its siblings.Had this game arrived side-by-side with Civ 5 in 2010, it might have been received better, but it hasn't really brought much more to the table than a semi-ambitious fan mod of Civ 5.  The 4x genre has evolved in the last 4 years, and new comers such as Endless Legends really put this to shame. ",226,43,3,45,33,1,88

												The game is fun. It's like Civ 5, but with completely bland leaders. It also repeats things that peeved me in Civ 5, like snapping me away from a unit I'm already interacting with to automatically put me in control of a different unit, or wasting my time by showing me somebody else's low-rank warrior fight a bug a hundred miles from one of my towns.The new aesthetic is pretty neat. Everything is very spacey.  Your towns and units change in appearance to suit one of three general game paths that you go down. There's harmony, which is coexistance with the aliens, and purity and supremacy, which honestly seem to be the same, as I can't tell the difference between the two. One's orange, the other is red, and they're about...being violent, maybe? Or being a militaristic human? I don't know. I don't think anyone does.The leaders? There are a small number of them, and they're meant to represent groups on earth that banded together. I.E., there's the Pan-Asian Cooperative. None of them are really interesting in any way. They have different accents, different colors for zones of influence, and have varying weak and generally non-influential powers. None of them have unique units. It's really a letdown. My favorite is one that speeds along espionage, as that seems to be the most useful. As the game goes on they have some kind of visual effect to denote the path they've chosen (they're subtle, and some paths may not even have ones, it seems), but you will never be able to see yours. That's a dropped ball.I'm new to the Civ series, and while this game is fun, vanilla Beyond Earth just isn't that good. I recently bought vanilla Civ 5, and this is just so inferior. When compared, the rulers in this one are weak and uninteresting, the wonders are nearly pointless, and the names of military units are completely unrelatable (and, by the way, the names of them change throughout the game - have fun keeping track!). Maybe expansions and future patches will make this game better. Until then, I feel like I've wasted my money...tl;dr It's Civ 5, with a new skin, the return of irritating features, and new boring leaders.			",253,43,2,22,12,2,25

												Sid Meiers has always had a reputation for ""screwing"" the consumer, Beyond Earth is no exception. One could relay back to Civilization V without any DLC and see that it was nearly unplayable. Beyond Earth is simple a rehash of what Civilization V is (currently) but with a mediocore space theme. The apperance of the game is almost one of a mod, created by a user. Overall wait for DLC but for now ""Two thumbs down, would not bang.""			",50,6,1,6,10,2,20

												If you have been waiting for Sid Meier's Alpha Centuari 2 then you will be greatly disappointed.  This game falls very short of the potential of what made that game unique and amazing.  The complete lack of water development and terraforming brings the lack luster of this game to an apex.  Does this stop me from playing, not exactly.  I do find myself wondering why do i keep playing it.  The trade system in the game is so completely unbalance it is depressing.  The end game is anticlimactic, and the quests quickly blur together into repetition.  I would have liked to have seen more of a cross between Alpha Centuari and Call to power represented here. That is not why i cannot bring myself to recommend this game.  I can not recommend it because I feel like this game was released because it was time for a new game to come out in the series people and franchise held with little to no regard.

												This game has received huge critcism from several sources, but despite reading all of this I still brought it, and i'm glad I did, at first it is very difficult to understand with lots of new situations andchallenges to adapt to, but I feel this is all part of the experience of the game. It gives an interesting insight to things that at this rate of scientific discoveries are very plausible situations that we could be in. I'd recommend buying the Rising Tide DLC as it really adds to the game, for example aquatic cities, they're so fun but also hard to manage, this game seems to be severely underrated and i'd really recommend it to civ players with expererience of the franchise but i'd lean towards Civ 5 for new players, I look forward to future updates and DLCs and, with civ 6 rumoured to be released this summer, I can't wait to see the latest installment if it is indeed released. It is a thoroughly enjoyable game with good graphics and designs, It is interesting from start to finish and fun, I hope you enjoy this game if you do indeed buy it, thx!I'd rate this game about 84/100			",143,26,3,13,14,5,11

The game is so butts I'm just not willing to risk buying an xpac hoping it gets fixed until I hear there's been some AMAZING changes.

												Absolutely incredible. Gameplay is similar to Civ V only better. There is a lot more decision making that makes you feel as if you were actually in charge of a civilization, and the results have real, almost tangible effects on the game. I felt like I was discovering a whole new world the entire time and really strategizing my resources and decisions, whereas Civ V, I often find myself in the same worlds making the same decisions. Here, the victory combinations and outcomes are endless. My favorite component of the game are the quests. It gave me something to do and incentives to build improvements, fight aliens, go on spy missions, etc. Similar to the quests given by city-states, but self-paced (no turn limit), no diplomatic pressure, and better rewards. AI is much better. I played for about 185 turns and no one declared war on me. I also didn't feel as if someone were nagging me every two turns. There are no city-states, per-se, but there are stations you can establish trade routes with and the benefits are much better (more science, culture, etc.). No one begged me for money, either, which was nice. There was lots of room for expansion, even on the standard map, so border issues were almost non-existent, save one time I discovered artifacts near Brazil. You also get to choose missions for your spies and what they can steal (if they succeed). Alien personalities were pretty random and I had a few explorers killed, but not as much of a nuisance as the barbarians in Civ V. Never felt as if I had to constantly protect my workers or colonists, and they didn't pillage tiles nearly as often. Few drawbacks: 1.) Resources and their management. Rather than relying on the a few basic improvements/resource types (quarries, mines, plantations, etc.) there are a lot more resources (which I liked), and most of them have specific improvements that need to be discovered by exploring the tech web. Thus, resources take a lot longer to obtain, are more scarce and harder to trade, and can drastically effect game play depending on your location and what type of victory you're aiming for 2.) I was a bit confused as to how expeditions work. I did a few, but there were times I would bring my explorer to an expedition site and couldn't do anything. This could very well be a big that requires what I imagine to be a small patch, but nonetheless it was a bit off-putting. 3.)The miasma was an inconvenience.Overall, the strategic value and adventure in this game off-set these things. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys any games from the Civ series and anyone looking for a strategy game that really puts you in control. Still haven't finished the current game I'm on (I believe I left off at turn 185 which put me around 2900 AD from what I remember) or tried multiplayer, but I can't wait to see what else this game has in store. Overall score: 92/100.			",37,8,1,6,5,0,16

Rising tides makes the game a much more enjoyable experience, not that vanilla BE isn't good but the whole diplomacy system is leaps and bounds better. Love this game, just needs more content.

Firstly, when a unit is given its orders the game on regular occasion waits a few seconds or even minuets before it moves on. The only way to get around this is to save which seems to reset the game back so you can issue orders to the rest of your civilization (quick save bound to F11). also, the minimap is almost completly broken and no soultion has worked for me so far.

												Having played a solid 40+ hours of this, I feel I can give a fairly straightforward review.First of all, if you are a fan of Sid Meier's games, especially in the last several years, then you will likely find enjoyment with this. It feels like 75% Civ 5 and 25% Alpha Centauri. I played very little AC in the past, and don't remember a whole lot, but the spirit of that game is noticable in Beyond Earth.Those familiar with Civ 5 will have no trouble getting started in BE, requiring low in-game-advisory assistance. At first the game feels somewhat like an expansion to Civ 5, but you slowly realize that it separates itself fairly quickly with the tech-web and some of the missions/quests.It's a lot of fun for a Civ-junkie like myself, but I still question the $50 price tag. There doesn't seem to be much change in the Civ 5 game mechanics to warrant a $60, but also feels much more than a $30 expansion. It also feels incomplete. Not like there are bugs of any kind, most of the errors in the game are the same that exist in Civ 5 and they are pet-peeves that could be worked on to improve stream-lining the gameplay more than ""bugs"". I just feel that the game was designed with limited flair and depth to make way for future DLC. Looking at how expansions were handled in Civ 5, I can see all sorts of additions to BE such as playing non-humans or a reworking of some units and the tech-web itself.One thing I have considered from trying to get a broader view of the variety of quests/missions that are unique to this game is the potential for a much deeper story, something that strays from the usual Sid Meier's style, a bit more reminiscent of Warcraft 3 in how that game introduced characters central to a campaign. Your units in BE improve as your affinity levels rise, giving you some customization and beefing up their strength significantly. This makes you slightly more attached to units than previous Civ titles. While this is turn-based and Warcraft was real-time, it would still be neat to see a sort of campaign mode added to set this title apart from others, since it already seems like a hybrid.Sid Meier's fan rating, despite it seeming prepped to cash in on future DLC: 8/10Overall rating for casual fans of turn-based 4X styled games: 7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Like Alpha Centauri before it, Civilization: Beyond Earth breaks the shackles of the third planet and offers up a gameplay experience that is both familiar and alien at the same time.A friend once remarked to me that everything he knew about human history, he learned from Sid Meier’s Civilization games. Well, at least the stuff that he fondly remembers—not the Indian history lessons hammered into his brain thanks to the fear of an impending exam the following day. With Firaxis’s Civilization: Beyond Earth, however, there’s a different kind of learning to be had—you learn more about yourself as a person, or more particularly, whether you will turn into a megalomaniacal dictator with a thirst for blood, a defender of humanity in its current state of technological and social evolution, or a future-ecologist who has a curious love for all things alien.IT’S NEVER TOO LATE TO GO BACKIf anything, Civilization: Beyond Earth made me realise that it was never too late to go back; back from the ocean of triple-a blockbusters with obscene production values and downloadable content to a game that’s mostly about building stuff, indulging in a spot of faux diplomacy and spending several hours to get a minor Tile productivity bonus. This is interesting because Beyond Earth is doing the opposite as far as the series is concerned; it’s going forward. No longer constrained by our miserable little blue planet (which Firaxis foresee becoming uninhabitable in the future), Beyond Earth takes you on a journey to the stars—the story begins with a moving cut scene in which we see a father bidding farewell to his daughter so that she can find hope for us all somewhere else in the universe—a theme that carries through across the game.OF AFFINITIES AND FAN SERVICEThere isn’t much of a departure from the way in which Civilization fundamentally works in Beyond Earth—fans will be greeted with familiar visuals (which could use a sprucing up after all these years) and scenarios that require decisions to be made. While the game does allow for players to choose their own path by picking an ‘Affinity’, of which there are three: Supremacy, Harmony and Purity. Suffice to say, they’re both akin to ideologies from Civ 5, but offering military and other bonuses.With Beyond Earth’s considerably hostile planets, armies are of utmost importance. Alien life-forms can be quite aggressive, while planets are laden with Miasma, a harmful gas that damages units over time (at the beginning, at least). Over the course of several hundred turns, I noticed that pretty much all non-military activity plays second fiddle to the might of your armies and their quest for blood. Yes, you can still achieve endgame objectives without annihilating all other human factions, but having already built up considerable forces to repel alien threats, it feels like a no-brainer to achieve your goals through might. Besides, diplomacy doesn’t always produce good results given that the AI is pretty dodgy for the most part.CLOSING THOUGHTSCivilization: Beyond Earth is the absolute perfect follow up to Civilization V, with strange new worlds to explore and advanced societies to establish. What’s more, Beyond Earth’s sandbox allows you to really play the way you want—made possible by the flexible research tree/leaf system. The quest system gives the game much needed context while easing players into the kind of choices they will need to be making on a macro level, while the endgame is greatly affected by the path you take in terms of Affinity. On the downside, I found the emphasis on combat to be excessive—more so than previous games in the series, while the UI (despite streamlining) can still feel overwhelming to new players.My Rating: 8/10 ",807,308,49,101,97,14,113

Pros:✔This is still Civilization experience, so you can actually enjoy this for some time✔Immersive music and sound design that perfectly fits the new space setting of the game✔Overhauled visuals✔Affinity system allows you to choose the 3 ways to build your civilization: Harmony, Supremacy, This system was perfected in Rising Tide expanison by allowing players to create hybrid affinities.Cons:✘Quests system. A good idea actually, but gets repetitive way too soon✘No actual terraforming✘Broken diplomacy. I know diplomacy is not a strong side of Civ series. But in Civ BE it's a complete disaster. AI is too passive. Diplomacy was partially fixed in Rising Tide. But why we should pay for fix?✘Lazy design of the interface✘Late game is boring. New type of victories is getting repetitive after the first timeBeyond Earth is the ""safe sequel"" to Civilization V.  If you were looking for Alpha Centauri experience this is not it. This game is such a waste of opportunity. Firaxis could create something bigger than cheap Civ V reskin. And now dev's abandoning Civ BE (no second expansion pack and further updates) and concentrating on Civ VI. This is how they treat their fans, who actually supported them and bought this game.

												So, my impression after 12 hours: Can I get about $45 back?First, let's talk about the tech tree. I'll compare it to Endless Space's ""web"" tree fyi. From the first turn, the ""web"" in BE is fugly beyond compare. There are so many techs and one tech rarely leads to another tech in any way that makes sense. Endless Space (ES) has a nice, orderly web to it. Military tech goes up, science/industry right, growth/happiness left, colonization down. I don't even have to look at anything to know where everything is. If I want a military option, I go up. BE though, there are so many links that have nothing to do with one another. My first game had me research something that required a special resource, where was the tech for that resource? I still don't fk'n know, buried within a million other options. The Web is a horribly ugly thing.Second; AI. The AI is atrocious. Enemy factoin explorers can't figure out how to move, so they move between the same 2 tiles till I destroy it. Autoexplore is garbage, I hit that on my explorer and it sits there till I take control of it. Civ5 had AI personalities like Montezuma or Ghandi, but BE I feel like I'm playing against the same 7 people, all of whom are completely irremarkable. To top off the irremarkable factions though, the AI is completely passive. I've tried to anger it multiple times to no effect.Third; Aliens. These things should make early game a pain. They do not. They will 1 shot an explorer, but they'll ignore my colony or the military that is murduring them into extinction. Seige worms? They are target practice. They don't ""seige"" anything, they sit there till I've taken the required 20 turns to kill them. Yawn.Fourth; decisions. Here is something I thought BE was going to do well. My first game had me make choices, does my ___ give me extra production or food? Cool....next game I get the same exact choices to make and they all end up feeling boring. I would love to see some randomization, maybe a chance that something fk's up and my thorium reactor does something bad. but no, the same boring decisions each game. I never feel that the choices I've made actually make a difference. Some choices have you allow an invasive species to continue invading the planet or stop it, you choose and your affinity level goes up, but beyond that, nothing. Fifth; UI. So, one gripe I've had with most 4x strategy games is the UI, especially the Civ games. What's worse is that Endless Space has an amazing UI. However, BE's UI is worse than I could imagine. Sometimes the ""exit"" button is on the bottom of the screen, sometimes It's on the top.... CONFIRM CONFIRM CONFIRM CONFIRM and, you guessed it, CONFIRM AGAIN!!!!! When I make friends, I get the same message from all my other friends talking about how we are friends with their friends....I don't like the ""Let's get our names tatooed on eachothers butts and be BFFF(yes, an extra forever)"" AI, much less the fact that I have to reconfirm it a million times. ES is amazing because everything I do can be done with the left mouse button or the rmb quickly, completely, and, most importantly, comfortably. This UI though, has me hunting everything down. It's fugly beyond compare.Sixth; A glorified mod. That's all I can see this game as. It's Civ 5 on another planet but without civiliaztions that feel different from eachother. I didn't expect the game to be something so completely different so as to not be a civ game anymore, but I also didn't expect it to play it SOOOOOOO safe. Every design decision I see feels like the accountants decided to design the safest game they could. BE doesn't really do anything remarkable.It's a decent game, but it's a glorified mod worth about $15-20 and not $60. And, worst of all, it's an ugly glorified overpriced mod that does nothing remarkably. I have no doubt in my mind that I will forget about BE as soon as the next competing game comes out. It's a good game, it's just a completely averge good game.Final score: Gonna forget it within 1 year/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												fitst of dont let the play time fool you i played about 30 hours while my wifi was down for a while and steam did not count it.The civ franchise is or now was my favorite Strategy franchise except mabey rise of nations. So when i first heard about Beyond earth i was super pumped i unfortanetly bought into the hype and it bit me in the♥♥♥♥♥so hard. first of all if you want a new inovative civ game you wont be getting it. This ""new"" game could honestly be a realy well done mod or hell they probaly could have just made this a big Dlc pack. the factions feal pointless as they offer next to no variation not to mention their are a lack of factions and unit variation in general. also unlike how you could have games of 16 in civ 5 now that number has been limited to 8 because of lack of factions i am guessing? They could have easily given each faction a unique unit and building but instead each faction gets a little wimpy bonus and diffrent color. The actual gameplay is exactly the same to civ 5 only with the new health system that in my opinon is broken and realy limits your empires growth while not even effecting the Ai. Amitidaly the game has a few redeming factors like the planetery wonders and affinitys and even the difrent world types are real cool. But it need way more variation and content to even be considerd a new game. Even the Native aliens which are cooler than Barbs from civ 5 massivly lack variation and loose relevence after the 2nd age , the "" mighty"" siege worm being killed by one tank unit and such.They even dumbed down the mod buddy and such by removing the world builder which was huge fun for me in the last game. that realy pisses me of since their was no reason to get rid of it and they promised it in the pre release. Over all the game is ok but it dose not deserve to be considerd its own game at all. like i said eaither a good mod or big Dlc. Good for about 25 to 35 hours of fun depending of online freinds wait till its on sale to buy. Over all its a 6 outa 10 for me and it saddens me to give it that score			",33,1,0,13,7,0,16

												Disappointing.  Graphics are less than expected for an update to the Civ series. Game flow, while somewhat familiar to Civ players, is sufficiently foreign to warrant better guidance than is provided in the Civopedia.  The robotic advisor provides guidance but gets on your nerves after a while.I've been playing the Civ franchise ever since Civ I.  I think the merger with 2K has weakened the Civ franchise.  Still a big fan of Civs III, IV, and V, especially with interesting mods that extend the units and techs.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

However, the reason I like it is also the reason I hate it. It is much too easy and lacks any sort of challenge.All in all, this is an extremely fun game BUT it is not for everyone.

												First off let me start by saying that like others, I love Civilization. Got into it around it's third iteration and loved it, as well as, 4-5 + Alpha Centauri. I went as far as buying a Surface Pro 2, just so I could have a mobile touchscreen version of Civilization 5, that's how much I love that game. Despite a long backlog, it's the game I tend to play every night after work.Beyond Earth will not be replacing CIV5 anytime soon unfortunately. The first thing that made this game a complete step backwards was the lack of Touch Support. Here is a game that is pretty much a modded civilization 5 and they somehow made it even less optimized and unable to support touch input. Despite lowering all the settings on my SP2 it quickly crashes after 2-3 turns.So then my only option is to play on my gaming rig or stream it to the tablet. So I played through my first game on the gaming rig. While it wasn't terrible, I agree with everyone else. The AI isn't very intelligent, the leader screens are bland, aliens (barbarians) are really annoying, help is non-existent in the game or just not streamlined, it's missing things like advisor pages, etc... Health and energy, affinity and tech are all there to limit and draw out your city's progression.To give an example of the difficulty I had with this game, I was at one point bored enough to attack another city. I could see from their defenses they could easily wipe out some of my military. But a few turns later they were begging to give me a city. Meanwhile I can't even explore the ocean without a group of Kraken ganging up on my ships.The Tech tree is just convoluted and difficult just for the sake of saying ""oooo sci-fi."" Did I mention that I'm color-blind and the colors do me no favors..? Not to mention the Miasma that just seems to blend into the tiles for my eyes. I of course will parrot the same disdain for trade routes constantly bugging you for renewal.I want to love this game. I want to pretend that my disdain comes from it being different. But ultimately I feel like they got rid of a lot of the good and balance that was in CIV5. I know when CIV5 first came out there was a lot of hate and people felt there were balance issues. Hopefully the same will be said about BE and further patches + dlc will really develop this game.This will be the last game I preorder from Firaxis, next time I will wait for a sale on HB or GMG with all of the DLC at $5-10. Especially if touch support is completely dropped.			",45,4,1,8,1,0,16

												I really, really want to love this game.  There's a lot to like about it.  It's gorgeous, the combat is meaty and satisfying, the core Civ 5 gameplay is as good as ever... but something's missing.I know it's unfair to draw comparisons to Alpha Centauri, and I'm going to try to avoid doing so, but it's disappointing how BE lacks any real, impactful way to conduct diplomacy or interact with the aliens.  There's no global council/UN sort of diplomatic institution.  The addition of ""favors"" doesn't have much of an impact.  And even for a Harmony civ, there's no real difference in your approach to the aliens; sure, your unique units have aliens in them, but the ones on the map are still as mindless and randomly hostile as ever.The small map sizes and the small number of civs also hurt the game.  Even a ""huge"" map feels much smaller than a Civ 5 map of the same scale, probably to make up for the fact that there are only a handful of civs--and those civs' leaders don't really seem to have the kind of powerful, identifiable personalities of their quasi-historical forebears.  The few snippets of dialogue each leader has only communicate the barest sliver of personality.  The ARC lady likes money, I guess?  Elodie is French?  The African Union guy is... there?  All of the techs have little quotes, many of them written by one of the leaders, but even these don't have a tenth the personality packed into, say, Miriam Godwinson's furious screed about nanomachine ""homonculi"" from (drink) Alpha Centauri.But the biggest drag comes from the most boneheaded carryover from Civ 5: happiness, nee ""health.""  Just as in Civ 5, it's an annoying drag that forces you to spend resources combatting it.  Unlike in Civ 5, however, you can't mitigate it with luxury resources, and you can't turn excess health into a powerful golden age.  You have to either keep building and researching Health buildings--which basically negates the entire point of the game's touted ""tech web"" system, since you'll need every single Health structure you can get just to stay out of the red--or manually take control of your army of Workers, since their auto-build AI doesn't seem to care about Health and won't build Health-boosting improvements without specific direction.  (They will, however, be happy to build huge swaths of Energy-sucking Terrascape improvements... which also don't benefit Health, which is dumb.)There's potential here, but this game is going to need expansions and mods before it starts to shine.  Don't buy it just yet.			",118,43,0,41,20,4,33

												If you liked playing single player in other civ games, hold off on purchasing this one for a while; the a.i is weaker than ever, with it being ridiculously passive throughout the game despite my attempts to royally♥♥♥♥♥♥it off (unlike a few certain civ's in civ V). The a.i does almost nothing except makes a few cities even on the highest difficulty.The civ leaders also lack any real kind of personality and just come off as boring. They have very few lines and practically all non-spoken dialogue is word for word from civ V.The aesthetic for the tech web and so on is horribly designed. It is very hard to differentiate things or tell if the tech you're researching unlocks a wonder. It's all just boring as hell monochrome.The aliens would have been a great addition if they actually would attack your cities and destroy improvements, currently they just mill around outside your borders (even without city upgrades that force them two spaces away from your cities) even if you start comitting alien jihad. Sure, they'll actively try to murder your units when you♥♥♥♥♥♥them off/are within two hexes of a nest, but otherwise they really don't do anything.Espionage is very fun and worthwhile in this, with you building up intrigue in cities by doing operations with your spies in them, unlocking new operations you can do within them. You also get quit a few spies to conduct these operations with, so if you wanted to focus on that you easily can.Trade routes are a lot more essential in this than in other civ games, especially since there's no max distance a caravan can travel (just need a clear route) and that you can have two trade routes in each city. The changes to them have made the game much more fast paced, since you will have quite a bit of currency to spend to directly purchase buildings/units.All in all, I would wait for a sale and/or for the first expansion to come out to round out the game better, it just feels kinda bare gameplay-wise in some areas and has strange mechanics decisions in others (new cities being founded take a few turns before they're fully built and operational being one of them, it isn't annoying or anything, but it doesn't seem to accomplish that much in the long run). Do not believe the hype.Alternatively, if you have a few friends to play this with, this is probably the best civ to do it with to date, since the games end faster than in other entries in the civ series. Though there apparently are problems with the multiplayer, though I haven't really had any issues yet.			",224,51,0,59,24,2,58

												As much as I looked up to this game and wanted it to be good, it really doesn't live up to its title. Doesn't have the feel of progression that you got in Civilization, and it got pretty dull for me after the first game. Considering you start off with the ability to build roads, farms, mines, and generators(tradingposts like old civ) straight off the bat, and then later you are getting all sorts of tile improvements that are way better so you wind up having to build over half the stuff you allready made making you spend uncessisary amounts of time micro-managing your workers. (I've never been a fan out automated workers.) The Technology tree is, in my opinion, VERY unbalanced. Because of its web-like structure there are pretty much 3 levels beyond the middle. And when you research one of your technologies you realize that it would take around 30-40 turns to get a tech that is further away from it, so you research other techs instead while you get your science up. Not with free technologies though. With free technologies you can jump for techs that will give you HUGE advantages over everyone else. Say you research Physics, then that unlocks bionics which would normally take 60 turns to get from your position, but not with free techs. You can instantly research things that would normally be FAR beyond your reach until mid-late game. So far i've only seen a few ways of getting free techs, Franco-Iberia gives you a free tech after 10 virtues, and Slavic Federation gets one after they launch their first orbital unit. Also another way is if you put 15 points into the Knowledge virtue tree, which doesn't take long because the knowledge tree is focused on science and culture. By combining these you can gain technologies that are normally unobtainable until late-end game. Say you get 2 free techs some time during mid game and you have got robotics allready, You can then grab nanotechnology, meaning you can start building the exodus gate as soon as you reach purity 13. Using free technologies can allso be used to get affinity points quicker than everyone, and it doesn't take much to Upgrade your units into much stronger units. All you need is 6 points to get the 3rd tier Soldier giving it 24 str. where as the marines prior to it only have 14 str. , nearly DOUBLING your units strength compared to everyone elses. And once someone gets ahead in affinity there is normalling nothing you can do unless you can catch up, and catch up fast. Oh yeah and you know how in Civilization 5 you had to build any new units you got or upgrade your now-obsolite units inside your borders? Well once you upgrade a unit in this it automatically changes all of the units to the upgraded version. So you could be fighting a large group of enemys and then all of a sudden all of his men turn into super powerful Centurions (48 str.) who are literraly 2x as strong and the unit prior to them. Oh yeah, and because of that it means someone can build loads of units and then get one more point of affinity, having a much bigger army then if they built them after they got the upgrade. (Upgraded units cost much more production to build.) On the topic of affinitys I feel that purity may be a bit stronger than Supremacy and Harmony. Harmonies units abilities are that they get large bonuses for when they arn't adjacent to eachother and for being in miasma, and supremecies units get bonuses for adjacent unit to them and flanking enemies. Purity on the other hand get bonuses for attacking and defending. Their Soldier units can get bonuses when on defence and/or bonuses for unspent movment, along with the abilites to heal every turn with the Centurion. Then their tanks (instead of getting the same bonuses like the other affinities get for all of their units) get bonueses to their attack strenght and/or bonuses for unspent movement, (kinda the same but still a bit different), and with the Dragoon tanks they get 50% bonuses against cities. Also take note that their tanks are stronger than the other affinities tanks. Not saying that the other ones are bad, I just feel that purity gets move convenient abilities. And on the normal difficulty the ai are very unintelligent, taking forever to level up their purities making them very easy target mid-late game for players. Also I once played on a huge map and meet an ai whos capital was about a good 50 tiles from me who had a good location for a second city near it. Instead of settling there though, it traveled 50 tiles down to my capital and founded their second city in resource-barren location right next to my capital. Speaking of cities and resources, the removeall of happiness and replacing it with this 'health' system has, in my opinion, SEVERELY broken the ways you build your empire. Unlike in Civilization 5 where you could build many cities, just as long as you keep them relatively small until you build more buildings and improve some nearby resources to get happiness, you could have a large, vast empire of cities. In this that is nearly impossible, having more than 3 cities mid-late game you will still be struggling with keeping your health positive, let alone 5 or 7 cities. Why is it so hard to stay healthy? Because the only way to get health is through buildings, no longer is there any resourses to build cities at to make sure your empire stays in the posatives while the city grows. No longer is there any way of getting help from another Ai or Player and trade for a resource to get you out of a bad situation. All you can do is build buildings/and or raze every city that you can. In the end the customization is poor, ""Choose good upgrade A or near worthless upgrade B."", honestly, who is going to choose +1 movement when you could have it heal every turn? No actual choosing what weapons, armors, chassis, or reactors like you could in Alpha Centauri. Affinities are pretty much glorified ideologies from Civilizaton 5. It runs off of the same engine Civilization 5 does which kinda makes it feel more like I paid for a overhauled version of civ 5. I could really go on a find more things to say about this game but I'm thinking I'll just end it on this. In the end this game is basicly a unbalanced version of civilization 5, feeling very slow at alot of times. I'm sorry to say this but being a huge fan of the entire Sid Meier's Civilization series I do not recommend it. If you are still intrested in getting the game for yourself I wish you the best of luck and hope that you have a better experience than what I've had. If you'r looking for a game that is like Alpha Centauri and more up-to-date then I would highly recommend you have a look at Pandora: First Contact developed by Proxy Studios. In my opinion it does much better at brining back the Alpha Centauri gameplay elements that we all love along with some newer features. Kinda a shame when the company that has been developing these civ games didn't manage to make a better sequel to their own game...			",99,6,0,16,12,0,13

												Feels more like an overpriced expansion than a stand alone game. Given the resources available pales in quality compared to Endless Legend. Victory conditions are very dull, as is victory. Poor UI, very limited performance information and the happiness/health mechanic carried over from Civ 5 is simply baffling.			",91,14,2,30,12,2,43

												9th August 2015:It's basically a re-skin of Civ 5. Some new elements here and there, but not enough to make the game feel fresh :SDo not buy instead of Civ 5. Civ 5 has much much more content - we have yet to see what the Beyond Earth DLC will bring, but as of now, it's a no-brainer to get Civ 5 over this.Personally I love space which is why I got this - other than that Civ 5 is sooo much better ^^12th January 2016:I picked up the first downloadable content pack, Rising Tides - pricey at £25 but it wasn't really discounted much in the winter sale anyway :(. It does freshen up gameplay by adding new features (aquatic cities, artifacts, marvel quests) and expanding upon existing ones (hybrid affinity bonuses, more in-depth diplomacy)However this should not have been an expansion. Vanilla Civ: BE is far too bland a re-skin of Civ 5 to warrant anyone paying full price for it. Also wait for the dlc to go down in price, cos it definitely isn't worth 25 quid. Look forward to seeing what new features we can expect in coming dlc though :)			",263,67,25,20,19,2,26

												This is one of my favorite games.  Ever since I got this, I cannot go back to Civ V.  Perhaps its the alien atmosphere that pulled me in, or perhaps it was the aliens that are watching your every move, staring at the 'aliens' inhabiting their planet.  The tech web is amazing, to the point that it can be overwhelming to newcomers.  Long gone are the linear tech lanes of Civ V, which to me makes the game better in that aspect.  You no longer have everyone running to create the same Wonders in Civ V, thus making the game less linear.  I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys good 4x strategy games and enjoys Sci-fi titles.  Highly recommend.  10/10			",427,90,17,68,28,5,91

Let me remind all of the people who played Civ 5 when it was vanilla that it had comparable features and content. You can't expect a game that is brand new to hold as much content as a game with numerous expansions/dlc content.

												Too many balance issues at the moment to find this game enjoyable. Trade routes are tedious as all hell (8+ cities? You will be assigning a trade route every single turn) and they completely imbalance the game as the AI doesn't know how to use them. Difficulty is a joke. Snowball factor is still in this game and its much stronger than in Civ 5.Unless you're like me and just a Civ addict, wait for the expansions / GOTY edition.			",297,51,4,38,22,3,53

												So much disappointment here.The first thing I learned is that this game was made with the same engine as Civ V. That means most of the mechanics and the tools to modify them already existed. This game wasn't made so much as it was just slapped on top of it's predecessor. With all that I at least expected that the developers could put their time into expanding the game play and adding new features but after spending the last 3 nights with it, it feels like a gutted product. I couldn't find enough to like to justify the price or the name.Here is what I found missing.No religion - Now we have affinity instead. You gain levels by researching certain since paths in the tech ""web"". All but two of the victory conditions require you to pursue an affinity at the cost of a well rounded society.Confusing Interface layout left a lot of information hidden by default.Neutered Diplomatic options left you with little options when it came to protecting the new versions of city states.Boring victory conditions -You need to research a tech, gain x affinity and then construct a wonder.No cut scenes for wonders/victory 4 hours of playing and I was rewarded with the same tired victory screen from Civ 5.Terrible wonders that take way too long to build. I saw very few wonders that actually had an impact greater then a regular building...they just took 50-70 turns to build.I'm hoping for a patch of some kind soon...I feel like I got half a game here.

												This...well, put it like this: When I bought Civ 5, I played it for hours on the first day I bought it. When I bought-no, sorry, preordered-this, I played for a bit, realized I didn't know what I was doing, because of the nowhere-near-as-useful help system in Civ 5, watched the AI build wonders that I didn't know how to build because of the disorganized tech web as well as the fact that a Wonder looks like a normal building, and then played Civ 5. I really wish I waited for other people's reviews and give this one a miss. There's technically 1000 civs, no joke, but only eight sponsors, the things that would be considered actual civs. Eight's a bit of a step down from the full count of 43 with all expansions and DLC with no mods in Civ 5, plus, there's no feeling of dread if you meet a warmonger, no feeling of awesome when you meet that civ that's always your friend, and, since these are future civs, you have no idea what their personality is, especially their preferred affinity, as, it seems, that decides who your friends are. (Although these may not exist as I saw the Asian civ pick Harmony on my first full completion of the game, and Purity the second time, but since there are preferred ideologies in Civ 5, I'm assuming there probably is.) This game isn't terrible, but there are very few things that set it apart from Civ 5, and pretty much all of them have problems of their own. First, there's the tech web, which is a tech tree with less techs and higher science requirements. The tech web has ""branch techs"" like Ecology which usually give a couple of buildings, like your average tech from Civ 5. It also has ""leaf techs"" which, far more often than not, contain a level up in an Affinity and a bonus to an improvement or a wonder which does much less than one of its Civ 5 equivalents. Then there's the Affinities themselves: Harmony seeks to live in, well, harmony with the aliens and the planet, Supremacy turns your civ and its population into cyborgs, and Purity which does nothing but be human and dismiss everything else as ""false."" These Affinities, as said before, dictates who your friends will be, and it starts fairly close to the start. Even worse, it's quite difficult to change your main affinity, in fact, it's much more difficut than it is to change your ideology in Civ 5. None of the victory paths are familiar except for Domination, but the other ways are...odd. The Contact victory is essentially meeting God, the Emancipation victory turns all the people still on Earth into cyborgs, the Promised Land victory takes everyone from Earth to live on the new planet, and the Trancendence victory effectively makes everyone share a brain with the planet. These are more ridiculous than the Diplomatic victory in Civ 5, because there's just too many people on the planet to have one person rule over them. About the only good thing I can think of that doesn't have a defect somewhere is the Virtues, or Social Policies: Unlike Civ 5, they provide bonuses for adopting multiple policies horizontally as well as vertically. The game certainly is playable-I pretty much only play singleplayer in games in general-and I would go so far as to say it's good, even great if it was the first Civ game I played, but the first Civ game I played was Civ 5, and it's definitely not as good as that. Maybe when expansion packs and DLC come out, it'll be a pretty good game, but for a Civ game, the combination of unanimated character faces, or even the fact that their facial expression changes to anger when hostile/guarded, the slower tech speed, the lack of eras to know how far you've gotten through the game, the lack of unique units for civilizations (Affinity unique units do NOT count), the nerfing of City-States to Stations that give a fraction of what City-States gave you and the general blandness of the game (Civ 5 was a LOT brighter, as in brighter colours, as well as the generally absurd events that can take place during a game of it) leads to me not recommending this game. In the future it may be better, but for now, it is very disappointing, and currently not worth your money.TL;DR: Read the second-last sentence.			",15,12,1,1,29,0,2

												I absolutely loved Beyond Earth. The one problem I always disliked with other Civilization titles was it seemed like I could never enjoy the era I was in as I was always trying to out tech my opponents. While in Beyond Earth having a high science is great, it really doesn't feel like you have to be racing the other civilizations. My one complaint with Beyond Earth, and particularly it's DLC, is that terrain has little strategic value when the oceans are colonizable. However, I would still recommend Beyond Earth to any fan of the Civilization series.			",89,8,0,12,24,0,27

												Sid Meier's Civilization Beyond Earth + Rising Tide DLCBeing a huge fan of space exploration and sci-fi fantasy games, Sid Meier's Civilization Beyond Earth fits my taste perfectly. It has enough new content to feel fresh, while also keeping the familiarities of the series at heart.Positives:+ Gigantic tech web where you can research new upgrades for units and buildings, which grant affinity points. These points further your progress in a particular affinity - purity (human focused), supremacy (machine focused) and harmony (alien focused). Each affinity has unique combat units and a different appearance for said units. With the addition of Rising Tides DLC, you can create hybrid armies with multiple affinities. + Many victory conditions exist, from domination to contacting aliens and liberating humans on earth, to name a few - so you'll get multiple playthroughs.+ The introduction of artifacts and research pods at the beginning of the game is great. Sending explorers to derelict settlemens, sunken colony landers, crashed satellites, alien ruins and more results in the chance to discover rare artifacts. Such items give either an immediate benefit or can be merged with eachother to produce a powerful building schematic. + Graphics are good, considering Sid Meier games are typically birds-eye. + I really enjoyed the atmosphere of Sid Meier's Civilization Beyond Earth and how this changed between map types. The terrain detail was superb. Depending on the map selected, you'd have desert or tropics, perhaps a frozen ice world scattered with tiny islands. It changed the way you approached the game and how you felt about it. Variety is important to maintaining interest.+ Another part of Sid Meier's Civilization Beyond Earth that I thoroughly liked were quests. Small decisions which influenced how you built your nation, which resources you acquired and which affinity you would lean towards. Do you choose to eradicate local alien wildlife or study them? There are probably well over 100 of these quest decisions in the game, meaning each new game can take a new direction. Mixed:~ Combat between nations is really fun but not very challenging once you've built a foundation for yourself (even on higher difficulties), it's usually the first 100-150 turns which you struggle in.Negatives:- Really hard to find any cons with this game. Extremely solid across the board. The one thing I would say is that the highest difficulty tends to result in unrealistic diplomatic backlashes, where it becomes unbearably hard to manage relationships and you have enemies on all fronts. I was really keen to try and finish this game on Apollo after beating every other difficulty, but it's too much of a chore than balanced strategy. The AI bonuses are so huge it's stupid. Overall Score: 9/10Definitely worth getting this on sale.			",66,3,0,9,2,0,8

												I dunno where all the hate is coming from regarding this game. Sure there are a few issues here and there but overall it is fun. Although many have compared it to civ 5 and argued civ 5 is better, i disagree. This game is similar to civ 5 but different enough that it has its own personality (i.e. affinity levels are how you level up your units), quests for you to do (which is new) and instead of trying to use characters based on earth history (albeit loosely) like civ 5, this game starts you on a new planet. Sure that path you choose (i.e. affinity) means that pretty early on you have to decide which affinity your going to major in (as this determines which resources you will need the most). Its still engaging. In my opinion this is no different than when I played civ 5 and had historical expansionist leaders nearby to me (i had to formulate a strategy early on to decide whether i was going to woo one or some of my neighbours or go full on military myself and quash my neighbours). This game requires similar decisions as people with similar affinity will be warmer towards you and more hostile towards you if your not. So all in all i don't find it detrimental that early on i need to pick an affinity. In general though the comparison to civ 5 (which is also a great game, but has been around for years and has had expansions and other dlc content added on over time) is not a fair comparison content wise. Civ 5 has been out for awhile and they released content that expanded the game...beyond earth just came out and people are comparing to civ 5 as it is now (not as it was when it came out..which was still damn good). The graphics are amazing, it plays similarly to other civ games so if you have any experience with previous civ games you should be good to go after a few games. New fans to the series will face the daunting task of anyone coming into any civ games (using the civilopedia and advisors often to find out WTF is going on.I haven't played this game as much as some of the negative reviewers simply because i have bought a lot of games lol..what can i say i love games. But i can still come back to this game and enjoy my time spent here (i just have to be in the mood to play a 4x strategy title, and have the time to to so, as i like to play through a whole match in one sitting) as any 4x strat fan knows it takes awhile to go through a whole game. All in all this game lived up to my expectations from viewing the early gameplay videos and developer videos. I read the reviews before i bought it and they recommended it too. overall i am satisfied with this game and have already preordered starships (as this game although a standalone will have some cross over play features with starships). final opinion...its a great 4x strat game, buy it if you like 4x strat games as there is a lot here to do, and its fun and has a good deal of depth.

Had a good time, and it kept me coming back. Like others have said you keep telling yourself, ""just one more turrrn."" lol But yeah it's got a few flaws, and I wish the edga pan and keybind were customizable because the setup theyve got going is super annoying but for most I imagine it will be tolerable. I'd pay $20 for this game. Any more than $25 and I'd pass it by, Gonna try playing Civ 5 now. From what I{ hear it is better.Edit: I played Civ 5. I like this better.

On Sale it's enjoyable enough but with CIV VI out now I'd sooner point you there.			",260,61,2,27,21,2,40

												Really disappointing. I pre-ordered this game hoping for a spiritual successor to SMAC, and it instead turned out to be Civ 5 in a dull new skin. Actually, it is not quite that either. The gameplay feels more hollow than Civ 5 somehow, which is an accomplishment considering the additional game systems they have added, such as orbital satellites. Visually too the game manages to look underwhelming compared to Civ 5. Narrative-wise, the game does itself an incredible disservice by laying bare all the major plotlines right out of the gate, inside quest/win-state descriptions. There is no sense of mystery to anything, and it really beats me why they decided to do that. What was meant to be the player's new alien world to discover, feels instead like an uninspired sci-fi B-movie reboot where nothing interesting ever happens.  What disappoints me the most is the lack of ambition and innovation from Firaxis at this point of the franchise's life cycle. If you are looking for a 4X style game that actually makes an effort to break the mould, I would highly recommend Endless Legend instead. Those guys are actually trying out new things, building amazing worlds and factions, while Firaxis seems to be sitting on its laurels and living off Civ's inheritance.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Civilization Beyond Earth, whilst a very good game, feels like a good mod for Civilization V. If you have Civ V, in my opinion, you DON'T need this game unless you collect firax games. The only reason you would want this is if you have played every empire several times and you wnat something new but not too different. New players to the Civilization collection may want to skip Civ V and go straight to Civ: BE - don't. Civ V is a much more rounded game with much better AI and more choice. Ok, there are exactly 1000 different starting situations with the new set up game idea - which is very good but limited to 8 factions - but only three are really good adn meake a difference to the game. Certain factions are OP and whilst the patch fixed this, many are still always going to win.The Ai is awful. I settled 4 cities as close to the slavic federation - the warmongers of the gaem - and they told me to stop 37 turns later. 37. Then they were still 'friendly'. i then declare war and as cities are so weak i capture all their cities within 5 turns. Micro management needs more shortucuts. if you 10 citites you can have 20 trade routes and whislt that is great, there is no key to sewnd them on their previous routes which is not needed in civ as you have only 5 or 6.I promise this is my last groan. Improvements. Tile mprovements are great in this game but they cost TOO much. Really 2 health for a petol well? then you have £2 on top of that. AARRGG. i am just in positive happieness - but i need the petrol to advance on my victory situation. then the better farms - terrascapes - cost 6 energy. If you have to settle near tundra at the start of the game YOU ARE SCREWED. Restart the game immediatly. the affinity system is great and the fewer units makes it all so much simpler - but the affinity system is limited and it almost feels like it has been stuck at the end of the game to allow end game to be fun. I love the virtues as i felt in Civ V there were too many different paths to go down, the four is just the correct amount. in conclusion Civ: BE is a good game but has been shamed by previous civ games and after a long wait I expected more form the best stratagy game maker, in my opinion. Dont get me wrong I had fun playing but i think i prefer Civ V. I would recommend it but it is not worth he money you have to pay. With some patches, I think this could go to great places, but before them DONT BUY IT.			",22,1,0,8,3,0,6

												Disappointing.There are some good changes to the Civ formula here, but it isn't enough. There's just so much that feels unfinished or half baked. If you're looking for a successor to Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri, this isn't it. In the end, it just makes me want to play Civ 5 again. Good: The map feels much more alive. I like that the aliens can be tolerated or destroyed. Eventually those alien nests become valuable, though, as they conceal a strategic resource.Mixed: I don't actually miss trading technologies, but what are favors and why do I want to gain them? Mixed: The addition of the orbital layer is kinda neat, but it doesn't really add that much. It will get some attention in the first expansion, but this is not a review of future potential. It's a review of what I already paid $50 for.Bad: The science fiction technologies available in the tech-web are sciencey sounding gobbeldy-gook. There isn't a solid sense of scientific or technological progression. Thus, the implicit narrative of progress is largely lost. This is a major bummer. It just feel like you're constantly choosing the next bonus. Bad: The endings are largely unuitive, anti-climactic, and unsatisfying. The writing and lore don't bring a satisfying or coherent sense of narrative and once it's done there isn't so much as an animation to pat you on the back. Worse yet, the old series of ranking, replay, and analysis screens are absent. About all the fanfare you get is a ticket back to the title screen. Bad: There's a general sense of unfinished clunkiness to a lot of the UI. It doesn't even bother to remind you what a city just finished building when prompting you to chose the next project.

												17 December 2014: I would not recommend Civilization: Beyond Earth yet, but that might change in the future. See below for details.In short: The game as a whole seems LESS than the sum of its parts. Similar to Civilization V when it came out - Beyond Earth for now is not a good gaming experience. With time Civ V was patched and extended and became one of my favorites. I hope the same will come true for Beyond Earth. But  what exactly is the problem with the game? For me it's two things.First of all the different pieces of otherwise very good mechanics don't exactly come together because of the lacking lore  of the game. The story, the different philosophies of the factions and personalities of their leaders and the overall world setting are far from complete, deep or anything but basic. And when inevitably compared to its spiritual predecessor - Alpha Centauri which had epic lore, Beyond Earth seems pretty poor...for now.As a result the game does not escalate in scope, something that Alpha Centauri did quite well.The second problem is the ""Technoabble"" used in Beyond Earth. The naming of technologies, build options etc. is ""clever"", but really not clear in it intent and purpose. That kind of ruins the atmosphere. It makes you feel at times that you don't know what you are doing and prevents you from clearly setting your goals in game. Going through several replays of the game you will eventually figure it out, but IMHO it should be more universal and less clever to be more enjoyable.I'm hopeful that beyond Earth will grow with time to be much better.

												It's okay, but I wouldn't recommend it to most people that I know. It definitely needs some new content as the vanilla version of this game went REALLY fast. Why do all worlds have bugs on them? Hopefully there are expansions planned that make this game have more longevity and variance. I mean come on, there's a whole galaxy of planets, yet they all look and act the same (and again, bugs).			",4,0,0,1,3,0,8

												I gotta do it, it pains me but I have to write a negative review.I can sum this game up in one sentence: Re-textured Civ 5 vanilla.I defy anyone who doesn't think so to prove otherwise.Basics:1) Energy is gold.2) Health is Happiness (and no, saying they're different because you only get a -10% productivity at -20 health instead of your people rebelling is not making your point for you).3) Virtue is [culture].They function literally the same. Virtue increases your borders, just like culture. Resources, strategic resources, etc.. all of it is just re-skinned. AI? I played on Apollo, not once did the AI attack me, even when I was buying land all up on their border. You get a passive aggressive message saying ""I see what you're doing"", but that's it. I spied nonstop on people and got caught many times, blew up their satellites, made units defect, etc... yet all I got, again, was ""I see what you're doing"". You want to know what BE is like? Load up Civ 5 vanilla and play it on the easiest difficulty with no AI and that's BE. Wonders? When you can figure out where they are (hint, it's the smooth hemisphere icon with something under it on the tech web) are just like regular buildings with n+1 modifiers. Oh this increases the virtue in said city by 5% AND counts as a node? Why then did I spend 1200+ production on it? No wonder movies. It's an aesthetic thing, but when you grew up with AC busting out with wonder movies that made you FEEL in wonder, it's kind of lacking. Same thing with the tech. Uninspiring. There is no race to get gunpowder, or friction-less surfaces (AC), it's just clicking for a marginal improvement. And the reason for that is that buildings in the bases are underdeveloped. It's like the wonders are the regular buildings, and they just didn't do the wonders.Affinities? Good concept, atrocious execution. You get them by default for researching things. You want to play harmony but really want that gene tech? Guess what, you're bootstrapped into going purity as well (some people would call this ""strategy"" as I would have to balance tech with affinity. good point, Unfortunatly, it is irrelevant when I can simply research all the tech and have max affinity. So, I call it lazy execution of another layer of gameplay). Like wonders, affinities do almost nothing for the bulk of the game but give your units a different skin. Sure, there are SOME benefits per affinity. Harmony level 6 heals in miasma, but by the time you reach that level, getting +5 health from miasma is worthless. Same with all other affinities. The only purpose for their being in the game is to trigger some of the end games. Units? SIX (I'm ignoring worker/colony). Rover, Missile, Soldier, Boat, Air, Super. That's it. Sure, you can upgrade them for a marginal improvement based on your affinity level (and you get one or two new ones based on your affinity...yaaaayyyy, but they are, again, virtually identical to what you have already), but Civ 5 at least has the common decency to give you units that vary in skill and use. Better still, AC let you design them. Here, you get SIX. Unacceptable.End games. Too easy. You build gates/flower and then you wait X number of turns or put X number of units through them and you win. There's no race for tech and components. There's no launching with a 1/3 complete spaceship hoping it'll make it, it's either all or nothing.Gameplay: The only other time I've felt like playing a game was a job was when I was going for gold in GT and missing it by .0001 seconds. THAT is work and yet, somehow, clicking the ""next turn"" in this game felt eerily like that. I've never been as bored playing a Civ game as I felt playing this.The basic problem with the game is this: Like with recent releases this game suffers from one major drawback: oversimplification. X-com did the same (but it pulled it off WAY better), Simcity 5 did it, Deus Ex Invisible war (and to a certain extent Human Revolution) etc... They all did. It seems that now days companies just want to move product. However, because they've gotten so big, they have to move a LOT of product and they are so afraid that mouth-breathers aren't going to be able to handle complex computations and thinking ahead. So, in order to appeal to the broadest base, like Fouchet in Bad Boys, they cut their product with something. In these cases it's with ""stupidity"". What you get then is Civ 5 in space. Literally.In the context of complicated games being good, Civ 4 took the cake on that. But Civ 5 was a massive simplification. It's like they thought they'd streamline it and people were like WTF is this, and then they took it back to 4 with the expansions. Same thing with BE, but this time it doesn't feel like an honest mistake, it's almost like they knew from the start what they were doing.It's unfortunate. This game could have been so much better, and what is even more galling is that it is GOING to be so much better....five months and 30$ later when the expansion comes out.Save your money and wait till this is either on sale for at MOST 30$ or they do some GOTY edition (obviously with the expansions) for 60$.

												I've been playing Civ V for a very, very long time, and yes, when the DLCs came out, it took me a little while to fully understand how the all tied in together, but it wasn't a big learning curve.Compared to Civ V, this game just want in a completely different direction and not in a good way. I've only been playing for less than an hour because that is about as much as I can handle with this game.After playing for as little as I have been, here's what I can take away from this game:- The learning curve is you start out with the game turning on and then it just go right through the roof with the rest of it.- It's not really clear the tech paths and how they are applied to the game.- Yes, they do explain a few of the new features, but my issue with it is it's almost counter intutitive to what was in Civ V.- They put too much, too soon on the game when you first start out. When we started in Civ V, a city, a unit, some hidden ruins, some state cities, and then the other AIs. All of it pretty straightforward. Here, they give you crashed space craft, aliens that seem to be able to kill you out right, AIs who seem to be able to get the upper hand faster than you, etc. and this was all on easy, are you kidding me?!Do yourself a favor and do not buy this game. The only other game that is similar to this and more fun, IMO, is Endless Legend. It's basically like Civ V, but with a more magical theme to it along with some very interesting game play that is difficult at first, but you really get the hang of it.I'm going to try and give Civ: BE another chance and at least try to play one game, but overall, don't buy this game. Just don't.I'll update this review once I get a game fully completed.			",83,21,0,22,20,0,11

												as you can see i obviously havent played a whole whole lot of civ BE so dont use only my reivew as a tiebreaker to decide whether or not to buy this game. during my time playing this game i found some things just outright stupid. health(happiness) is ridiculous. i understand its purpose to keep the player from massing cities everywhere but i feel as though it drops too dramatically. i also deeply detest the same basic units just upgraded to have a different bonus. heres your infantry. heres your land rovers. heres your ranged and heres your siege weapons. can we throw anything else into the mix like civ V did with different factions having special units that would help them out alot at their prime in the game? orbital units are helpful in some ways but too much of a hassle for my taste. aliens will rage to to no end if you hit them once ever until you completely erradicate them, and then be ready for all the other civilizations to be on you for harming the bugs. theres really not much i like about this game. there arent luxury goods you can get to increase health. its like whats even the point of having chitin and resilin. even gold and copper dont give you energy(money) from what i understand. just smh. i wish it was better. im not sure how one would make it better but i expected more.

												First, i am comparing this game to Alpha Centauri. Ruthlessly. Why, you ask? Because Beyond Earth was called „spiritual successor“ of that game. And because Alpha Centauri is truly a pearl of a game that sets the tone of every sci-fi Civ-like game in the future. Second, I deleted my original review and added this more improved, more poisonous and better review instead. Now, let us start. -	The factions. Alpha Centauri had sever distinct factions. All of them were given proper personalities, they played different, they felt different, the AI treated them different. From fungus-covered territory of Lady Gaia to industrial lands of Chairman Yang, they were all different. And the quotes! People still quote the words of all of them and remember them. In CBE, the factions lack any personality. Previous Civs had the historic figures that would mean something to you, but in CBE, there are bland characters that add to nothing, are not really different and are completely forgettable. -	The affinities. You can go for purity, harmony and supremacy- meaning staying human, becoming cyborg and hugging aliens. In theory. In practice, they are completely cosmetic and don’t matter much. You get some slight differences in units and cities use a bit different skin. That is all. And it is not logical- you can become purity without killing a single alien and you can become an alien-hugger harmony player and you can wipe out the entire alien population of the world without any penalty. Mostly- you can make a choice that does not matter. -	The aliens. They were supposed to be different then barbarians in the Civ games- and they are. Unfortunately, they are more like neutered space-alien-barbarians. Never in my game had i had one attacking my cities. Especially when there is improvement that keeps them at least 2 squares away from the city. Even in the beginning, they are a no-threat. And even if you murder them by dozens, the aliens don’t seem to mind. Not more hostile reaction, aliens taking the offensive or something. Nothing. Even though there is first level harmony affinity that makes the alien hostility to come down easier and that does basically nothing. -	The victories. Whatever victory you achieve doesn’t matter much. You get an uninspired pop-up text with a pretty picture saying basically „Congrats you won“ and voila, here comes the main screen. And all the victories except conquest one are basically science victories, where you have to build stuff and do some stuff as well. -	The diplomacy. As bad as in Civ 5. Combine that with bland factions mentioned before and the diplomacy becomes a bore. Plus, no clear view on how one faction is feeling towards the other? Are the Polynesians and Africans close or do they hate each other’s guts? No way to tell? In addition, no Planetary Council or UN-like feature where you decide global things. And the city-states, now dubbed as “stations” are even less of a value then in Civ 5. You cannot interact with them diplomatically. You cannot warn other players who are attacking the station you are trading with stop, you cannot declare war on them. Or you can declare war on them by moving your melee troop (yes, the soldiers/marines are called melee troops) and attack the station. That is declaring war- no other way. And the AI is not aggressive. Wars are few and usually end up in status quo. -	The planet. Looks like ye goode olde Earth, but perhaps with different skin and different kind of neutered barbarians roaming around. Terrain types are the same, terrain bonuses are the same, mountains have bluish skin. The resources are a bit different and occasionally, you see floating rocks or green goo. You feel right at home if you have played Civ 5- but is the point of Beyond Earth to feel right at home?-	The military. Less units then in Civ 5. One type of ship and one type of aircraft. Oh, and a carrier. No choppers, no bombers, no fighters, no heavy battleships and light destroyers. Same with land units- one melee unit, one ranged, one tank or cavalry like things and one catapult with missiles. Plus some affinity-specific units. One unit per square, soldiers and tanks are referred as “melee” units. Guess they use the butts of their guns. They also upgrade automatically when you gain affinity level- that is kind of nice. But adds to confusion- suddenly all your soldiers are called Cobras or whatnot. And the combat is quite similar to Civ 5, only you see less, because AI is not very aggressive. -	Quest system. Oh, the system that was going to bring the game to life! Really? Don’t hold your breath… Around 90% of the quest decisions are choosing what bonus to add to your building. So, do you want +1 health or +1 production to your new fancy clinic? Rest of them- you have to work really hard to fail and usually you get bonuses to your currently most advanced affinity. Sometimes you get to choose what affinity. And that is pretty much it. In addition, there are minor nitpicks:-	When the colony produces a construction, it does not tell you what building or unit it finished- just that project is complete. If you have 10+ colonies, you cannot remember what you built. -	Wonder pop-ups- when someone else builds wonder, it does not tell you what it does. It makes sense when you get that someone build Sixtine Chapel, but less so when someone builds Archimedes Lever.-	When you build Archimedes Lever, you get a nice boring blueprint nondescript wonder screen that tells you what bonuses you get, but does not answer the main question: the hell is Archimedes Lever?-	Same applies to all techs and wonders and buildings. You get a name, not-half-as-good-quote as from Alpha Centauri and bonuses. To dig deeper, you have to look into Civilopaedia. Works fine for Civ 5, where for example “Gunpowder” and “Writing” or “Barracks” and “Temple” does not need further instruction, but when dealing with “Soma Distillery” and “Xeno Sanctuary” or “Alien Ethics” and “Dark Networks” in Beyond Earth. There is still more, but the review is already two A4 pages long, so I’ll spare you. The conclusion- Beyond Earth is more like a badly done expansion pack of Civ 5 then a standalone game. It might get better with DLC/expansions, but at its current state I would suggest to wait with buying until the price drops about 75%. Or just do buy Alpha Centauri. If you manage to look behind aged graphics and terrible interface, you discover (or re-discover) a truly great game hidden behind it. Thanks for reading! ",97,24,4,22,19,0,39

												For me and most others the real draw to a civilization game is progressing through the era of humanity, slowly feeling a sense of progression as you discover the wheel and later research particle physics. I stopped lying to myself a long time ago that Civilization is the best 4X turn based strategy game out there, but the sense of progression through time it gives is not matched by it's competitors. However, strip that progression away and the game is nothing. Building a library to introduce education and learning to your civlization feels great, as you really can see what you are doing and it's effects. Building some random Sci-Fi garbage like an Xenofuel Plant gives no sense of progression, that trademark civlilization feeling. Sid Meier's Civilization Beyond Earth was and is a nifty little experiment, but for a civ game it is boring, uninspired, and bland.The tech tree is kind of cool though!			",52,7,0,3,7,0,4

												I don't know what is with all the hate about this game. I prefer civ beyond eath to any civ game so far, my only problem is that there is too little things to do like the options to choose quest or rewards are quite limited. I do not have the dlc yet but I have heard good things about it. I would rate this game 8.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've played well over 1500 turns at this point and still haven't had what I would call a ""fun"" game.  The UI is pretty miserable when compared to Civ 5.  The tech tree, for instance, doesn't really *pop* out anything except the affinities.  You get to search and hover over everything to figure out where the wonders are.And on the topic of wonders...why don't many of them build anything at all?  They feel very uninspiring and not very wonderful at all.  I built 3 or 4 last game and not a single one of them had a building on the landscape.The aliens are annoying.  You go from barbarians that can be turned off or at their worst can be defeated in a 100 turns or so to aliens that are never ending, respawn nests, and harass your units ceaselessly.  Or, you can build your tech tree to focus on being friendly and adapting to them.  Who cares though?  That isn't really very interesting, and again, the lack of anything physical from this (other than alien units) is very bland.As for the AI, it is downright annoying.  Diplomacy is one thing.  Being spammed by the competition every single turn with the exact same boring audio and requests is awful.  It doesn't take very long for their voices (especially the Asian lady) to grind on your ears like nails on a chalkboard.  Speaking of annoying, the trading is just awful.  Every 20 - 30 turns you have to reassign your traders.  They should adjust this to only needing interaction if they are attacked, the city is attacked/under siege, or if something changes with your relations with the other faction.  If you have 10 - 20 trade convoys or vessels running, you can easily expect to spend 50% of your interactions in the game just managing them.Oh, another UI problem....the victory types aren't explained.  You can hover over most things in the setup of the game and get some information, but the victory types just say Domination (ok, duh), Contact, Promised Land, Emancipation and Transcendence.  I had to look them up to figure out what some of them were.The game **could** be fun, but it really is just a slightly different take on past Civ games with less of a physical presence in the world.  Most of the things you do augment what you've already built, not build anything new.  It is very common to have the territory and your units looking bland and similar at turn 1 and turn 200.As it currently stands, I would not recommend this game.  Civilization 5 was so well done, has so many mods, and the expansions are actually most of what this game contains.  There is no reason to upgrade, and it is arguable that this is not an upgrade at all.			",277,54,12,44,109,2,102

												This is of course subject to change once it's balanced, but right now I do not recommend the game. This is coming from someone who happily has played 400+ hours of Civ V too.It feels like a poorly balanced Civ V mod. There are some novel things in there - the affinity trees for instance are pretty neat. The questing (done better in Endless Legend) is also ok as is the esponiage. But there are too many annoyances - health severely limiting growth, overly aggressive native life forms, oribtal layer not being very well developed, bad AI - combined with balance problems and a real lack of personality make this one a pass. Frankly, I've found myself clicking ""next turn"" over and over again because the game punishes you from exploring, the health problems prevents you from conquering and there's nothing else to do. What's the most maddening thing is that Civ V encountered - and then patched OUT - many of these same issues. There's no excuse for them to happen in Beyond Earth.The real killer is the lack of personalities. Yeah, I know that this game isn't a remake of SMAC but it's supposed to be inspired by it. Well, the thing that SMAC did that was so innovative was to give each faction a very distinct - almost unique - personality. The wonder movies, diplomacy and even the tech tree descriptions were all written around those personalities. Instead of copying this strength, the factions here are all faceless until far too late into the game (and by then it's too late). It's an absolute deal killer.Even after patches it's still a collection of half-baked ideas that simply don't work together. There are far, far better 4x games on the market. Skip this one.

												The first 100 turns or so hooked me.  The next couple hundred made me wish I could relive the first 100.  Becomes grindy and repetitive due to simplification and stripping down the Civ formula, especially if your a vet of Civ5 w/expansions.Brief +/- based on my playthrough+ The aliens.  In the beginning they're tough customers.  Honeymoon ends early...+ Great art style from units to cities to map+ The tech tree/map takes some getting use to but is interesting, but...+ The three affinities, but...- - Civilization ""Health"".  Mine was beyond -100 for the last 60 turns and it didn't hinder my ability to continue on.  Maybe, someday I'll go back and learn more...maybe.- ...how the three affinities are unlocked in the tech tree actually take away from replayability.  You're going to want to     go all in with any one of the three affinities to unlock their full potential thus limiting the paths you take for each tech/affinity. - ZERO improvemnets on Diplomacy and AI (my biggest Civ gripe)- Legacy performance issues.- The aliens.  Once you start teching up you'll start to see how one dimensional they are.  I was really intrigued initially to see what part they'd play in the long run, unfortunately they become little green barbarians.- Unit levelups totally underwhelming.  One option only: +% to ranged/melee strength.  Really lame.- City interface bare bones.  (why are building, construction, details all default ""off""?)- Mini map is way too small- No map overlay toggle like CIV5 so I can add resource icons to the map?- No great people- Wonders.  They don't provide a large bonus, but they're also not difficult to build.  Not very ""wonderful"".Overall, it feels like a WIP total conversion Civ5 mod.  A missed opportunity as the mid-late game really just feels like a feature-trimmed Civ5 with a graphics and names swap.  At best, this should have been a $15 mini expansion to Civ5.  Very disappointing.			",127,16,0,27,19,2,46

												I’m a long-standing fan of the Civ series and I’ve logged over 750 hours (!) playing Civ V. Needless to say I’ve been looking forward to this for quite some time. Unfortunately, while the new setting is welcome, I really feel that a lot of what makes Civ a charming and involving game has been stripped out – the core mechanics remain similar and the new tech web is a welcome departure – but it lacks the satisfying depth of its predecessors. Something that you begin to realise playing Beyond Earth is how much the Civ series depends on a familiarity with its historical setting to give flavour and inform your decisions. You know that Atilla the Hun’s hordes rampaged across China and consequently what he might be like to deal with; you have an idea of who Ghandi is therefore what he might play like – their histories inform their game mechanics, but there are no such cultural touchstones here. Yes, the characters that lead each faction have certain traits, but they might as well be called “blue team” or “red team” – there’s no historical contextualisation or existing character to draw from and because of that it becomes difficult to care about them. I’ve seen it argued that it’s actually the inverse of traditional Civ – that instead of having a pre-formed personality which eventually becomes more homogenised, leaders start out as blank canvasses which gradually develop personalities shaped by their tech. However, in practice I’ve seen little evidence in the writing that this is actually the case, merely that you mentally note that a faction is leaning towards one affinity and they might now shift their focus in one direction or another.Additionally, because of the futuristic setting, it’s difficult to actually tell what you’re researching. Beyond providing stated bonuses to tiles or buildings, there’s no way to actually conceive of what the building looks like or its function. That’s fine when it comes to basic buildings like the early trading posts and clinics but it really suffers when it comes to wonders. I know that a Bytegeist gives me a cultural and scientific bonus but what actually is it? The lengthy text descriptions do shed some light on this, but it’s hard to form an immediate connection with it in the same way that say, The Pyramids or The Statue of Liberty do. Wonders have been relegated to just expensive one-time buildings. While you can argue that that’s all they ever were in Civ, a hallmark of the series is how well it hides the raw stats in each play-through behind charm and personality, something which is completely lacking here. This is actually where I really miss the little wonder cinematics which are also absent in Civ V – a little video could go a long way to showing what kind of effects that wonder has (something that Call to Power 2 did nicely way back in 2000).This also extends to culture. Yes, a culture bar ticks up a few points every turn and yes you can build things to influence it but it’s hard to see what the culture is actually representative of. Culture implies a certain diversity and identity and that’s something that Beyond Earth really lacks, especially because there are no civ-unique units or buildings. That’s disappointing because the intro cinematic actually suggests a cultural dimension which is absent in gameplay. The designers seem to be well aware that a lack of historical narrative is a problem and have introduced quests in order to give a bit of contextualisation and direction to gameplay. However, what these mostly amount to are just “choose one bonus, this or this” or “choose one action, find out what you get several turns later”, neither of which are particularly satisfying.The aliens are a nice idea and welcome change to the usual barbarians, but they’re still more of an annoyance than anything else. They have rather unpredictable AI – they’ll ignore units and trade caravans one minute while decimating them the next – at least with barbarians you sort of knew where you stood. Also, once your Civ has reaches a certain tech level, they seem more of a chore than anything to deal with – all they really seem to do is pick off trade caravans which need to be tediously defended. I was disappointed that there wasn’t more interaction with them. Even when you play towards the Harmony affinity which is ostensibly about integrating with the indigenous flora and fauna, there’s no obligation to keep the original aliens around and as they’re frequently in the way of valuable real estate, they just become cannon fodder. It’d be much more compelling to perhaps allow units to tame wild beasts with a certain affinity level and use them for more than just military units – then there’d be more of a trade-off between exterminating the bugs and keeping them around – and a narrative and gameplay reason to prevent other players from doing so.   Here I also think they missed an option to be really creative – different aliens for different worlds or even simply different habitats (curiously, all types of aliens seem to be found in every type of terrain) could lead you to assess if it was worth domesticating them.The way that difficulty is implemented will be a familiar gripe to fans of the series. The AI has a base level and the way that the game is made harder is by giving the AI more stuff, not making the AI actually better at what it does. It’s no more cunning at higher difficulties; it just has more to throw against you. I’m not really sure if I expected this to change in a new Civ game, but it doesn’t require you to make more creative decisions, just more efficient ones. And the bizarre and unpredictable demands of the AI  - notably the “stop settling near us complaint” – which seems to occur at the drop of a hat, seem to have been intensified here.That’s not to say that it’s not a solid enough game – the Civ franchise has had two decades to develop and the core 4x gameplay is decent, but the inherent charm, the soul of the game, seems curiously absent. It functions perfectly adequate as a collection of systems and numbers, but it doesn’t feel like more than the sum of its parts. All in all, in feels like a re-skinned and modded version of Civ V – but actually with some features removed; the religion stat added in the Gods & Kings expansion isn’t present here; you can’t win a cultural victory and the lack of diversity of units and buildings is disappointing.That makes it hard to recommend even if it’s not actually bad per se but it’s certainly a much shallower, homogenised game and a much less satisfying game experience.

												Civilization Beyond Earth has got to be, in my experience, one of the worst additions to the Civilization series. It is monotonous and has an uninteresting interface. I would consider myself a huge fan of turn-based strategy games and i love Civilization 5. It seems as though this sequel to the rest of the Civs is lacking in factions, interesting units, fun strategy and it certainly isnt as spacey as one made it seem. It makes me just want to carry on with Civ 5. There is a lot of improving to be done with this game to appeal to me. The game needs;1) A better landscape - The current one is hiddeous and unimaginative. 2) More factions - The ideas behind the ones that are there are fabulous, however they lack in being clearly more different from one another so i feel like no matter who i choose i will be playing the same stategy. 3)The release price does not at all reflect the games value in its present state.4) The Diplomacy interface is unorigional and too easy.5) Finally, the level of difficulties are not challenging, it's almost like a game for Civ Noobs.Overall however the game will be improved in the future i hope and it has some potential but right now i would not recommend the game in its current state.

												It has potential to become an excellent successor to Alpha Centauri.  If the developers spent ""one more turn"" on the game and polished things up before release there would not be so many negative reviews.  The early game is great with a variety of options to seek via virtues, affinity, and resources.  The aliens offer resistance and there is a feeling of exploration with the quests and explorer units.Mid and late game it bogs down due to poor AI and many choices that are hard to decipher due to a poor UI.Overall it is good game, but won't realize it's potential until it's been patched and balanced.Release 10/24:  7.3/10			",97,16,2,12,7,0,20

												The game plays like Civ5 but worse. The game doesn't provide information very well. It provides lots of information, but some critical information like ""you unit is about to die in miasma"" is not displayed. You therefore have to keep an eye out for many things manually and if you forget about something you'll lose units or other important things. The research tree is not good. On one hand you could say it provides options right from the start, but if you don't go for certain techs anyway, you'll get problems in the game. The progression in Civ5 was handled much much better.Also from what I've seen the unit composition is not that huge. You'll always build the same units, the just look slightly different. There is no real specialisation. The differences are very very small.So far the alien race don't seem to provide anything to the game instead of being more annoying than barbarians. I thinka chance was wasted here. Also City-States have been reduced to mere stations that provide just ressources.The technology is solid behind the game, but if you have to choose between Civ5 and Beyond Earth I'd recommend Civ5. It's the superior game.			",103,8,3,12,33,1,26

												I have over 1100 hours in Civ V, and over 40 hours in Civ: BE. As of today (30/10/14), I have finished all victory types except domination, and am working on beating the game on the highest difficulty.Firstly I would like to say this game is *not* Civ V. It looks like like Civ V, has many features like Civ V, but it is *not* Civ V. This is also not Alpha Centauri. Much like XCOM, Civilization: Beyond Earth  is a spiritual successor to SMAC. It brings to the table many new features, many of the things we loved in Civ V, and a few things that need improvement.The biggest difference is the new Tech Web. No longer are we confined to a linear path of building, but now we can branch out as we see fit, adapting to our enviroment, and investing our sciences as needed. This is a breath of freash air from Civ V, where going through the Tech Tree was almost formulaic. This allows for each game to be different in how and what you build, as well as allows you to quickly change plans should the need arise, and focus your efforts elsewhere.Unfortunatly, the Tech web is not intuitive. Since Civ V is about history, even those who know little about the past still have an idea what Metal Working would be, or what a unit called ""Knights"" are. With Civ: BE, as this takes place in a sci-fi  setting, we now have techs like ""Transcendental Math"" and ""Genetic Mapping"". Figuring out all the new techs, buildings and units are a simple search in the Civopedia, and though I enjoy reading through the lore and learning about these, I do not believe many have that kind of patience. Most would want to just jump in the game and play.Aliens replace barbarians, and do a good job. More dangerous than the barbarians, at lower difficulty levels they are hardly a threat, but at higher levels they spawn frequntly, and you cannot easily avoid killing many as you have to clear them out in order to expand. This causes the aliens to become more aggressive to you, and if you're not careful, you may find youself not only fighting the AI Civs, but the aliens at the same time.Quests have been added to this itieration in the Civ franchise. Unlike Civ V, where we already know the stories and history of the civilizations, we do not have that with Civ: BE as it takes place in the future. Quests add a neat narritive to the game, and rewards for doing them are minor so as to not cause an imbalace, and can even be ignored should one choose.The AI is no different than Civ V. To many players it poses some challenge, but to long standing Civ players, the AI is about as smart as a wet towel.Worlds are colorful, and Firaxis did well in making the planets feel alien, and the music in the game is nothing short of brilliant!The three aspects you can build your civilization around (Harmony, Purity, and Supremacy) are all unique, add great bonuses, and there's no penalty for putting points in more than one. I persnally encourage people to branch out, as even lower level bonuses are amazing. Much like the tech web, this allows for a different, less linear play style than Civ V did.However, Civ: BE does have it's problems. Automated pathing for Explorers often leave them moving back and forth between two tiles, and automated workers will prioritize the best possible thing to build, which costs energy, so if left to their own devices they will quickly drain your economy! In the last game I just finished playing, I had a mine built on a hill, and when I discovered one of the mineral resources, it did not add the mineral to my total, allowing me to use it, nor could I overwrite the old mine with a new one.Much like Civ V, after a few patches I have no doubt Civ: BE will be just as polished as Civ V. If you have played Civ V, and are looking for something different, this would be a good choice. If you're new to Civ in general, save your money for now, and invest in Civ V's Gold edition, where you will have a more polished game, DLC, and two expansions for cheaper price.Civilization: Beyond Earth will not replace Civ V, but it is a good game to go to when you want something a little bit different.

												I had lots of fun beating Beyond Earth. It plays a lot like a full conversion mod for Civilization V, but to say that's all it is betrays the beautiful restructuring of game mechanics that this version posseses. The game feels more dynamic (thanks to a tech web, as opposed to a tech tree), making each playthrough a completely different game. While Civilization V (and its predecessors) was completely addicting, Beyond Earth makes each game a radically different experience, something that Civ 5 did way better than any of the other installments of the franchise.That being said, I wasn't particularly fond of the glitches. I've heard a few people mention them before, but when I sat down and played through Beyond Earth, I found them to be quite bothersome. None were game-breaking, but often they were reptitive annoyances that are completely circumventable... once you learn what they are. The achievement counters also seem to be off, as I found myself occassionally getting two points for certain things when one normally ought to receive only one... Not that I'm complaing about that though!And the achievements are indeed a stellar part of this game. Civilization V was the first game to add them, and they often felt very grind-y and unneccessary. Beyond Earth slimmed most of those bad ones out, leaving in just a few for those gamers dedicated enough to endure the small bits of grind and reach 100% completion.At $49.99 currently, Beyond Earth has quite a hefty price tag. I'd personally wait until a 50% off or more sale, just to feel like you had no doubt that buying this game was money well spent. If you can get it for that price or less, it's simply a steal.

												It's playable, it's pretty, it's pretty stable at present, but it's not terribly gripping, and it doesn't move the series very far.The redone virtues trees with rewards for both breadth and depth are interesting, sure.The tech web has been done before (see, say, Endless Space) -- and it shares the common problem that the techs are a bit abstract and unfamiliar, lending itself to eiher ignoring all the names and descriptions to optimize for in-game benefit (if you're interested in playing *well*) or futzing around and finding yourself on an inefficient course.The sponsors aren't terribly different, the AIs still provocative idiots who aggress at the drop of a hat but have no clue about actually waging an offensive war without massive production bonuses and aren't amazing on defense either, covert operations are still grossly inferior to the Civ 4 mod ""White Lies/Black Ops"".  The UI is terrible and Firaxis should replace their designers with the guy(s?) who wrote InfoAddict.  And the fact that Firaxis has announced *another* 'SM' game in development suggests that attention and resources have probably already been shifted and that the Civ:BE spin-off won't be receiving much more.It's still on my SSD, but it's not calling out to me.  Valkyria Chronicles is a more interesting strategy game with more soul, and I'm more likely to go back to Dominions 4 if I want some 4X -- at least in the latter I can amuse myself by grafting copper arms onto Gelatinous Cubes and have them wield swords, and other silly things.  The AI won't keep up there, either, but at least I can be gratuitously funny and creative while I stomp them with werewolves using two-handed swords or maybe a moose trained as necromancer.

												Though lacking the historical depth of classic Civilization games, this is one of the best 4X stragey games available. At once, much more accessible and with better controls than previous Civ games, it also includes the affinity system to take a colony's progression into ingenious new directions. I loved the way the graphics and music added to the sci-fi feel and how the developer's preserved the sense of exploration--this time on an alien world. I'll still play Civ 5, but not until I have all the achievements for BE. Excellent job!			",1072,485,13,185,62,3,101

												Sry but this is another Scam.... this is not a new game, if you want to play wait for discounts this don't worth the price.This is a Failed DLC, they really screwed up this time.Really disappointing.So... now come the list os problems1) The maps are small you can`t customize your planet;2) The Leaders don`t have any personality, they are just talking heads and there are few;3) The made the diplomacy even worst then Civ5;4) You have to do everything by hand, managing trade routes on many cities its a NIGHTMARE!;5) The UI is abysmal, sometimes you need alot of clicks just to Queue stuff;6) The tech web is a mess and you don't fell any diference after you complete stuff;7) The aliens are stupid the A.I. make no sense and the creatures at the sea are REALLY unbalanced almost everything can easily kill your ships.8) The lack os inovation kills the game;			",38,7,0,7,13,0,32

												While the non linear tech tree may seem really confusing as  there are only certain ""real"" helpful thngs for people along certain points and you have to research stuff that ""Doesnt help at all"" think about it in a realistic matter. Never once in the course of history, even on accidental discoveries, have you had to first discover something completely irrelevant to find what you want, even if that accidental discovery did turn out to be what you wanted. While it does need more dlcs, and I would definitely hope for multi-planetary combat as it would involve not just land, sea, orbital and air but also space; but theres no point in complaining over  ""the unfinished thing"" if it isnt even FINISHED. A movie critic doesnt judge a movie before it comes out. they judge it when its DONE. sure you can judge this part but dont give up on it until its got the full-product out of the oven. Its like treating a cake that just came out of the oven terrible because you havent frosted it yet.			",2,0,0,0,0,0,5

												How you mess up sci-fi is absolutely beyond me. This could have been an amazing game, but the economy and diplomacy systems are completely and utterly screwed. Due to this, it ruins the game. They could have made this game insanely good if they would have concentrated on the core gameplay, but the developers obviously put too much time and effort into the graphics... which is the only decent thing about this game, and that's a shame. If I was to put a price on this then I'd say to only buy it when it's at £9.99 or lower. It's totally not worth the money with the current price being £29.99.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At some point is like playing Civ V without DLCs: Lack of playability. I figure this is why people give negative score to it.Well, I didn't take that point to evaluate SMC:BE. I enjoy it like I enjoyed playing Civ V vanilla. It's an entertaining and enjoyable game if you like 4x strategy and civ series. As negative factors, its interface is not good (seems like 'futuristic' means 'horrible UI'), tech tree could be a little confusing the first time and its lack of factions gives it poor variability every campaign.Not bad at all.

												Very very disappointed.I'm a big Civ fan, been playing since the origional and I love sci-fi so I was really looking forward to this game.However instead I get a dumbed down version of Civ 5. If you've got Civ 5, there is little to nothing to recommend you get this game instead. Lets list the major issues:1> AI still very poor2> Terrain/Starting City placement even worse than Civ 53> Alien infestations can make it impossible to leave your base, or there can be no aliens near you at all.4> 'Quests' with no explaination of where the rewards are coming from5> Complete lack of anything resembling reality..... I can build satalites and missiles, but I can't build a basic scout plane or a tank......6> Poor graphics, terrain types are not very well depicted. Hard to see a lot of features.7> Lack of new features/gameplay. In fact its basically Civ 5 with a load of features cut out. 8> Tech (web) is basically the same old tech tree but more simple, yet made more confusing. 9> Unintuitve interface.I'd like to include a list of good things about the game, but I'll let you know if I find anything. I'm going to give it a few more hours and will update this if I change my mind, but I really doubt that I will.			",23,0,0,8,8,2,22

												I've finally started playing this game, although it's been waiting in my library for a while now. I kind of forgot about it, but I recently noticed there was a DLC out, right about the time I was looking for something new to play, so I figured I'd get the DLC and give this game its rightful chance.I can't give you a thorough review yet, but I can tell you that at least so far (10 hours in), this game feels just like the previous games in the series, or at least like Civilization 2-5. I've never played the first, so I don't really know what it was like. I'll get to the specifics after spending some more time playing, but generally, it's pretty much what I was expecting, and what I suppose anyone who's ever played a Civilization game before should expect.Anyway, I know this game wasn't received as well as the last couple of Civilization games, and honestly, if there's a good reason for that, I haven't found it yet. I'm writing these very lines after forcing myself to stop playing, so I could get some sleep before a long day tomorrow. I could have otherwise easily kept on playing for a few more hours at least.More info to come as soon as I feel I have a good enough grasp of the specifics, especially in comparison to the previous games in the series.Update (14h+):While my general opinion of the game hasn't changed much since I started playing, I figured I'd share what I now consider to be its biggest flaw, which was also mentioned and discussed by many other reviewers. While the formula hasn't changed much since Civilization 5, the game's main backstory theme has, and in my opinion, it has changed for the worse. Up until Civilization 5, the series, at least for me, was about history, culture and progress. While Beyond Earth is also about progress, it lacks the other elements. Sure, each faction has its own history and culture, but those are totally alien and meaningless to me, as they're not an important part of the game, and I feel no urge to learn about them. If Civilization 5 was based, loosely as it was, on some true historical background, Beyond Earth is pure fiction in that regard. Some people may find this futuristic theme curious and refreshing, but I, for one, would rather have it the way it was before.Having all that said, as of now, there's no other strategy game I'd rather play. Not even Civilization 5, which has my highest playing time count (500h+) on record ever since I installed Steam.			",233,98,1,103,60,0,70

												First of all, I love Civ games. I have been playing Civilization since the original. I have 770 hours played on Civ V. Also, I didn't start playing BE assuming it was going to be exactly the same as Civ V. Just like when Civ V came out, there is a lot of pushback from people who don't like Civilization changing. BE does many things well, but it does things differently than Civ V.Pros: - Tech ""web"" makes game progression much more interesting. Tech is much less linear and you can specialize if you want to. - Aliens are done well. I feel like they updated this part of Alpha Centauri well. Miasma tiles play an important tactical role in combat, and Harmony players can use them to their advantage. - Unit upgrades aren't tied directly to tech. I think this makes the game more interesting, as you have to choose between techs that will upgrade your troops and others that might unlock more buildings, etc. Units can also be upgraded outside the tech tree through quests, and you there is a degree of customization to the upgrades.  - Espionage is improved from Civ V with more stuff for spies to do. You can even have spies add to a project that helps your cities instead of spying. - Lots of choices for tile improvements, with powerful ones costing upkeep. Tech allows customization of improvements as well.  - Setting is cool, although the game could use a few more terrain palettes for variety.Cons: - There aren't enough 'civilizations' to play as. This is inherent in the setting, as they have to make up every sponsor instead of just drawing from history. But there does feel like a lack of variety over Civ V. - Stations aren't done well. These serve a similar purpose to city-states, but they only function as trading partners. However, they always seem to disappear, either from neglect (they just seem to die out), or from other people attacking them. There is no way to enter into diplomacy with them, so you can't defend them from other players. - The game is a little too easy to play against the AI. The non-linearity of the tech web allows you to upgrade your units faster than the AI does. Since they balanced trade routes, this isn't quite as bad.Overall, it is a great game. Is it as good as Civ V? Currently, probably not. There are still updating it, with much needed balancing being done (e.g., wonders have been much improved). But that doesn't mean you shouldn't play it. If you haven't played Civ V yet, by all means, I would say play that instead. But if you want something new, this is a great addition to the Civilization series.			",244,73,3,37,37,2,56

												Beyond Earth is stylistically and mechanically a Civilization 5 mod.Basing the game on Civ5 is a good idea, but the game feels like Civ5 design principles held the game back.There is a tech tree web, but the freedom this affords is all an illusion because all the victory conditions except total domination (capture all enemy capitals) are technology based.  This means two things: (1) the game is a technology race (2) you don't get to enjoy most of the tech tree, because most decisions are forced in order to win the tech race.Pre-patch, there actually was a good mid-game military strategy.  But that got nerfed into oblivion.  So military option is a tech race, too.Sid Meier has long been interviewed about why the Civ series does not continue into the future.  He has said that Civ game concept is to (re)play through world history.  So there is an overarching fear to not to change too much from original.  While I play these games a lot, Beyond Earth promised something fresh.  It isn't.* Brand new foreign world or Civ 5 resources with different art and icons?  (There's oil and titanium, which serves the same role as aluminum...)  There are 3 faction specific * Tech tree --> not really innovative for reasons above* Combat -- this is stuck in Civ embark units mechanic -- it's 2600 and you don't start with hover tanks.   -- there are no melee naval units   -- your units upgrade for free with tech (hurrah ftw) but also your opponents (IMBA ftl)* There is novel affinity/unit promotion systemOn the whole, this game offers very little in the way of a new play experience.  It's mostly cosmetically atttactive TECH RACE.			",188,17,0,27,19,1,27

												Really wanted to like this game, but unfortunately...I love the Civ games, I loved Alpha Centauri. but this is the worst Civ game to date.It has some good points, and new thinking, but it is over shadowed by som many other things.Most importantly the tech tree doesnt make any sense, even through research on the net. A lot of buildings that just adds +1 one to something that you already have +6 on in that city, so you are not looking forward to a new building its just another +1.Health which is happiness is extremely hard to come by, so it seems to be build one city and make sure to starve the rest so they dont grow.I guess if you never played CIV games you might have a chance to like it, because you wouldnt know what a real civ game could be.Sid Meier you lost a long time fan.

												I made the mistake of pre-ordering this game based on how good Civ 5 is. I realize that Civ 5 with all expansions is a completely different and much better game than it was at release. Having paid twice as much as this game is frequently on sale for, I sure hope they release substantial fixes and improvements for free, rather than as relatively expensive expansion packs as they have in the past.It's not Alpha Centauri, it's not Civ5. It's Civ 5 with a different skin and a few half baked ideas. It isn't fun. I've put hundreds of hours into Civ 5. I can't bring myself to put any more hours into this one. I gave it a fair chance I think, but I lose interest so fast.EDIT 10-10-15: And just as I suspected, no real improvements to the base game. Instead they release a high priced expansion that fixes some things and further breaks others. Maybe by next Christmas they'll release another expansion that fixes this expansion, and maybe I'll pick that up on sale right before they release the third expansion.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Sid Meier knows what he's doing. My only pet peeve is the normal price. 50€ is quite a lot.Wait for the next sale and buy the game. It's definitely worth it.			",23,3,0,5,12,0,5

At the end, it is the same as other planet. It is too lazy for a AAA game title to not add each map a different experience, they can just change the name and visual appearance for the miasma, aliens, resources and typology type by keeping the same characteristic to make the map feel more unique to one another. For example, just change the green miasma to purple and name it as ‘xenon’ but it give the same gameplay effect. Hello lazy developer. In real world none of the planet look and feel the same.

												I played through one playthrough of BE, unfortunately, I cannot recommend this. While I am likely to play more of this after DLC is released, this game is hardly different from Civ5. The AI is no different. I knew not to expect any different gameplay, but the new features hardly have a real impact on the game as far as ""wow"" factor for me. The changes from tech tree to tech web is really nice and lets you focus where you want. The espionage system is much better than in Civ5. Unfortunately, neither of these make a large enough impact in the overall enjoyment I had to the game. It felt exactly like Civ5.The game overall is solid, but it doesn't have the new feeling that it should have, and it certainly is no spiritual successor to Alpha Centauri. If is a shame that I have to give is a not recommended, because I was so excited to give this game a try. It is likely that the DLC in the future will make this better, but it just doesn't feel like a new or special game right now.			",116,39,1,62,30,0,21

												Great art style but slightly too easy gameplay and an awful approach to diplomacy in both the base game and Rising Tide. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the game and don't quite see why there are so many negative reviews. The new approach at the tech tree and the added interest of choosing and working towards the affinities is something that sets it apart from being simply 'civ 5 in space'. The fun in the water settlement and moving introduced in Rising Tide is something that the main games will never have, along with unit customization and a few others.Maybe not as good as other space-themed turn based civilization builders, but a good game regardless.

												Don't buy this game thinking it's going to be anywhere as good as Alpha Centauri.  It's not a worthy successor to Alpha Centauri and I don't even think it's a worthy successor to Civilization V.It honestly feels like a reskin of Civ V; which would be fine if it was an expansion pack.  However, it's not an expansion pack; it is a full price game that should bring more to the table than what it does.  Civ V was a great game, but I already played it.  The changes Beyond Earth bring are not better, they're just different.Pros:Interface and game mechanics are similar enough to previous Civilization games that there isn't much of a learning curve.Interesting Setting.It's NEWCons:Lack of cinematics: There is only one cinematic in the game: the intro.  Everything else is done through text boxes, with the occasional voice over.  Alpha Centauri was made fifteen years ago and had one for every wonder. TEXT BOXES:  Congrats! You won the game!  Here is a text box explaining the ending(sort of).Lack of voice acting:  There is less voice acting in this game than both Civ V and Alpha Centauri Confusing world leaders, lack of story:  I haven't played Alpha Centauri in ten years, but I still remember most of the faction leader names.  I played Beyond Earth twenty minutes ago and I can't name one.Diplomacy:  No united nations/ planetary council.  Some of the same bugs and AI annoyances from Civ V are present.Tech Web: confusing, non-intuitiveInterface:  Hard to read sometimes.  Oh and if you're color blind you might find the game unplayable.If you're a huge fan of Civilization you might love the game, but you may feel cheated if you pay full price for it.  If you're a huge fan of Alpha Centauri prepare to be let down. ",38,15,0,11,8,0,12

												The mechanics that allow the game to be played are all here and seem to work well enough for me.  However, the lack of a fullscreen mode with HD resolutions, and the number of situations where there tooltips and flavor text is just flat out missing or lacking tells me this game wasn't entirely ready for release and should have been delayed or sold as Beta access.The game is playable, its even enjoyable, but there is no polish.  I feel like I'm playing a bare-bones beta game with only the most needed features to allow the game to be played.			",43,9,0,21,5,0,16

												I played through one playthrough of BE, unfortunately, I cannot recommend this. While I am likely to play more of this after DLC is released, this game is hardly different from Civ5. The AI is no different. I knew not to expect any different gameplay, but the new features hardly have a real impact on the game as far as ""wow"" factor for me. The changes from tech tree to tech web is really nice and lets you focus where you want. The espionage system is much better than in Civ5. Unfortunately, neither of these make a large enough impact in the overall enjoyment I had to the game. It felt exactly like Civ5.The game overall is solid, but it doesn't have the new feeling that it should have, and it certainly is no spiritual successor to Alpha Centauri. If is a shame that I have to give is a not recommended, because I was so excited to give this game a try. It is likely that the DLC in the future will make this better, but it just doesn't feel like a new or special game right now.			",116,39,1,62,30,0,21

												Currently the game feels as if the vanilla is stripped down to its bone. There are a couple of features that give it a different look and feel as opposed to Civ 5 and SMAC, which is a good thing. But I can't escape the feeling of wanting a more immersive experience in this game. Deciding for myself which way I would like to go, rather than founding myself lost in a maze of research goals, with a fixed capital city unable to move it, an AI randomly asking for 'favors' and declaring war the next turn or not really feeling connected with the building options. This all makes this a too confined experience. Simply give me a map editor, or some sort of option to increase my freedom of play. I seriously felt like I wanted to play Civ5 again, rather than continuing this game and after I noticed on the Community Hub that this game will be 'milked' with DLC incoming, I seriously advice to wait untill a hefty discount comes along. I'm sad that I can't give it an overall general recommendation, but I'm really hoping for a redemption patch in the future or some free or low-priced expansions.			",126,40,6,39,59,0,77

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!! What a WASTE of !50! dollars! this game is buggy, crappy and just flat out BAD! the AI sucks. the menus open 'sometimes'. If you go to war then you will be at war for the rest of the game because the AI doesn't know how to make peace.I've played every one of the Civilization games and this one is the WORST! WAY worse than Civ V which was the worst until this once came around. Sid Meyers is sure losing his touch.

												Sid Meier should consider removing his name from this product.Unlike Alpha Centari, or Civilization IV, who's production value drew a player into the world and made you care about what was going on, Beyond Earth is sterile, unimaginative, and process-oriented in the worst kind of way. It's like the developers started with a checklist and then made a game, instead of starting with a creative spark and figuring out how to make it work.This game is a retread of old ideas, and it isn't fun. Not worth 50$ without a major overhaul. Sid, I am not impressed.			",33,5,1,9,20,0,28

The lack of content, polish, and deep thought into the game slaps you out of the richness and immersion that Civ is known for, and makes it feel more like a tower defense game with a ""cool, sci fi, atmosphere.""

												I'd like to suggest that anyone who played Alpha Centauri not buy Civilzation Beyond Earth. It has shook off all of its spiritual predecessors selling points. The distinctive characters have all become generic and lifeless. The frighting nature of the new alien world and its wild life have become plain big bigs and, most importantly, the strong sense of the dystopian civilisations struggling to survive on an alien world has been utterly lost. All these issues culminate into a bland, cookie cutter experience. It is possible that Fraxis intend to change things with future DLCs, but its a sad state of affairs when you spend $50 on a title that needs another $50 of investment before you get what was expected with the initial purchase. Do yourself a favour, spend $5 and boot up AC! ‪#‎BeyondEarth‬ ‪#‎NotAlphaCentauri‬ ‪#‎ThankGodICanClaimThisBackOnTax‬			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very, very very similar to Civ 5. Desperately needs the Brave New World/Gods and Kings treatment. AKA Needs to be turned into a completed game.So much potential for a much better game. Aliens, who are neutral unless you're too close, could evolve and be a faction. Communication and the like. Perhaps they will become aggressive if a player ♥♥♥♥s with the environment too much? So easy to do, but laziness prevailed.the factions, jesus. Utterly boring and honestly there's hardly a lick of difference between them. The publishers are laughing all the way to the bank, as there's no ability to get a refund, but God don't buy this unless it's on special or you've waited a long time for it and have expendable cash. Cause honestly, it has less features than the fully expanded civ 5 game. Some backstory, or fleshing out, of the factions would be good? Perhaps some scenarios, campaigns or something? This feels like the barebones have been implemented, and they've asked their friends to try it and see how it goes. Rather than released for the OBSCENE price in Australia as it has been.shame on you. SHAME.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am hugely disappointed, to say the least. I have waited for the reincarnation of Alpha Centauri for all these years, and have bought this game at the first possible occasion. What I got in the end was just a dumbed down version of Civilization V, which was (in my opinion) just a simplified version of Civilization IV in the first place. Alpha Centauri was an etalon, a perfect game, which required only a graphics' revamp perhaps. There is nothing new in Beyond Earth, neither it has all the brilliant features of Alpha Centauri (unit constructor, terraforming, unique leaders' personalities etc.). Some people say that they are really happy that they never played Alpha Centauri. Poor souls, they even don't know what they missed. Even when not compared to its spiritual predecessor, Beyond Earth remains just an empty husk, and no pearls will appear from it.I WILL play this game, and WILL try to decribe all its cons and (if I find any) pros in more detail. Affinity system isn't bad, but it's more boring and less flexible than the social engineering system used in Alpha Centauri. So far, I consider Beyond Earth just a worthless waste of hard-earned money. It seems that the developers haven't even tried to make something worth the name of a successor to Alpha Centauri.P.S. This is my appeal to the people considering buying Beyond Earth. Go and buy Alpha Centauri instead.			",50,3,0,14,15,0,33

												I hated it. It's boring. I bought this game expecting it to be like Alpha Centauri: different philosofies clashing in an alien environment. But the factions in this game seem generic, their different points of view not interesting at all. This apart from the fact that the technologies you research seem to make no difference. Place sattelites, clean up the noxious alien gas. Settle. Deploy military units to kill aliens. Seems interesting? Well, it's not. Trust me, this game is B-O-R-I-N-G and I wish I had spent my money elsewhere. You should too. Go back to library and choose another.			",97,42,0,38,31,0,27

												Well if you like getting frustrated and annoyed this is the game for you! I loved Civ 5 and this is pretty much a reskinned civ 5 with a lot of shenanigans. There is a green mist that is randomly placed around the map that hurts your units and heals the aliens. Luckily you cant clear it right away so it makes it more fun? Also, Your expidition units which are used to clear satilites only start with 1 recovery unit, so you have to travel back to the city to get a new one. I could go on and on but I am going to uninstall this. I waited to see if it would get updated and fix some of the annoying and nope. Damn you Civ!			",125,13,0,25,2,2,24

												Having been exited for this release for quite some time, I was not disappointed.  Beyond Earth is definitely a Civilization game, though there are many differences that set this game apart from its predecessors.  To keep this review relatively short, I'll make a list regarding the game based on what I experienced on my first full game of it.- Similar to Civilization V's policies, Virtues allow you to pick and choose bonuses which will assist in the development of your civilization.  They are extremely well balanced and work well whether you focus mainly on one of the four categories (Might, Prosperity, Knowledge, Industry) or if you pick and choose throughout.  Synergy bonuses are given for both building wide or deep on the Virtue Tree.- The technology web was very enjoyable for this type of a game.  The old technology tree worked extraordinarily well when Civilization was based on history, though the open web is an excellent change for a Sci-Fi futuristic 4X game.  You can, for the most part, pick and choose which technologies best suit the style of play that you are going for.- Affinity, is somewhat similar to the Ideologies of Civilization V, in that it affects your relationship with others depending on which of the three that they have chosen from.  I focused on Purity, the affinity that seeks to keep humans human.  They seek to hold onto their culture and turn the newly colonized planet into a second Earth.  The other affinities are Harmony, which is the goal of integrating into the ecosystem of the planet, and Superiority, which is the modification of humanity via technology to reach a higher state of being.  Each affinity has it's own sets of bonus, special buildings, and unique units that give each and every affinity a different feel.Though there are many other new features (and others that were cut) these were the three that I thought drastically differed from the Civilization games of the past.  This game is a lot of fun to play and I'm very excited to see the expansions that will be released for it.Overall Rating: 9.5/10			",622,155,2,165,79,3,130

												There are a lot of good ideas here, but most of them feel half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Here are my main gripes, based on 10 hours of play.- At times UI is trying to be cool looking rather than functional. For example, minimap is quite small and contrary to store page screenshots, the color scheme has been changed so that continents and oceans are different shades black and gray. Not to mention you can see through the map which adds to confusion. Colors all in all are quite annoying. Sometimes miasma is quite hard to see, and resources of xenomass easily disappear into green mess that the map sometimes is (at least on lush biome I've been playing on).- Aliens are quite interesting but in my opinion they should be more varied and far more aggressive (note: I'm playing with ""frenzied aliens"" option on). Even when I killed them in the dozens and raided their nests they didn't seem to get more aggressive in return. Even AI civilizations are too passive. I can't remember a single instance where a civilization declared a war on another (in my 10 hours of playtime), except when I declared a war on AI player, and even then he surrendered without a fight.- Quest decisions are way too linear. About 80-90% of the time it works this way: You built a building and now some scientist/engineer has improved it, choose between bonus resource A or resource B. There, quest done in a couple of clicks. Same thing with unit upgrades, now you get to choose between instant heal or 10% strength. Unit upgrades you get via affinity are a bit better, but the choice is still always a binary one between 2 options. Can't we have more variety in our choices?- Each faction severely lacks personality since their leaders are straight up boring. Their specialties could be better too. For example Brasilia's +10% to melee strength is very unimaginitive. I would have much preferred Alpha Centauri like leaders with strong and well developed personalities, but that is hard to tie into Beyond Earth setting with the affinity system.- Oceans need more life in them. This time only developer's imagination was the limit and they chose not to utilize the oceans in any interesting way. How about super rare and useful resources in the middle of nowhere, guarded by krakens? Alien artifacts sending signals from the deep, inviting explorers? Aquatic cities?- No natural wonders. But why? They should be easy to implement and would add a lot of character to the planet.Tl;dr: Game needs more variety and depth (in quests etc,), utilize the setting better, more aggressive AI and some fixes to color scheme and UI in general. These issues need to be addressed quickly by the developers. It's a tough decision, but at the present state, I can't really recommend this game, even though I'm enjoying it despite its many flaws. There are many good aspects to the game: tech web, virtues, orbital layer, affinity progression... but right now the negatives weigh too much.			",854,297,31,116,79,9,156

												I love the Civ games, but cannot directly recommend buying this one. For a high priced game, I was expecting a lot more.The game may be worth buying when it hit a 75% price reduction, but right now I really feel ripped off.The current feel of the game is an unfinished Civ 5 clone. There is some nice ideas, like the new tech tree and affinity, but the implementation is horrible at best.The tech tree idea is great, but the current ""navigation"" is horrible. The techs lack flavour. It would have been easier if they had just called it ""upgrade 1"", ""upgrade 2"" etc. (Comprared to the Tech description in their older games this is really lacking).The affinity system is a nice idea, but you lack control, and with the way the tech tree/upgrades work, it seem more random what you end up with, not that this is a real problem as all the cool upgrades is in the start of the affinity tree.Some more ranting...Like the old Civ games, there is some ingame documentation (Civ manual), again this is a huge step backwards, as there are no ""links"" between relevant stuff.All in all, this seems like a game build upon the existing Civ engine, by some interns, with some rough guidelines and a limited amount of time.Now My review may seem a bit harsh, and the game is ""ok"" just not worth the full price, and way below the usual standards of the Firaxis/Civ brand.Having paid full price for theis ""product"" I really hope they will do their best to fix the problems (crappy AI etc.), if the fix is in form af a DLC we need to pay for... well then I lost the last respect for the firm. If not, and the problems are fixed/game improved to the normal standard of Firaxis/Civ products, then I will gladly rewrite this review in a more positive tone. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really wanted this game to be good. I really wanted this to suck in hours of my life so I could pretend to be humanity's messiah of the stars. Sadly, I was mistaken. I'll start with the few good aspects:-""Customizable"" Civs: This is a great feature because it really lets you fine-tune how you want to play in order to win. This customization also leads to unpredictability, allowing more replay value.-Tech Web: The tech web also allows you to customize what you're doing and how you're doing it with it's branching paths and tech ""leaves"" to research. Because it's so non-linear, it's harder to tell what other Civs are researching, and that leads to more interesting, varied gameplay.-Aliens: If Barbarians were cannon-fodder, then these are the guys shooting the cannons. Never have you felt so threatened by ""barbarian"" units as you have these guys. Naturally they eventually become less and less threatening with advanced combat technologies, although some of the aliens keep their threat kevel high even in the late-game.-Affinity-Specific Units: These are units that can only be unlocked through a combination of the tech web and having enough points in a certain Affinity. These units look cool and are fairly powerful, and create a bit of unit diversity.Now for the bad. With 200+ hours in Civ 5, starting off post-Gods-and-Kings expansion, I'm no newcomer here, although I've still never been very good at playing but always enjoyed the game nonetheless. Even still, I was able to win on turn 317 on the normal difficulty when I had trouble doing something like that in Civ 5. In fact, it was so easy, I barely even played. I more of just micromanaged my four cities after putting up my anti-alien fence building. Near the end I even just went ahead and started razing my neighbors cities with my ultimate Harmony unit JUST TO BURN TIME UNTIL I WON. No one put up a fight against me, even my neighbor-now-enemy had just a few ranged units, one planted in each of his cities! I also found some of the gameplay changes, like Happiness to Healthiness and lack of some kind of Beyond Earth-equivilent of tourism/religion, made the gameplay feel very dumbed down. The game also felt very bland, as I never really saw any other units besides a standard Marine, Explorer, and Worker robot until I got my special units, and even then only saw them (this is more relating back to the AI seemingly being incredibly incompetent, but still a con nontheless). As well, the color pallette seems to have noticeably darkened, and personally becomes much more boring to look at as a result. All in all, I think Civ: Beyond Earth needs what Civ 5 got; A GnK/BNW expansion that adds more to and fixes the base game. In it's current state, I regret spending $50 for what feels like a polished beta of a game.Pros:-Custom Civs and the tech web lead to unpredicatable gameplay with better replayability-Alien AI actually feel threatening and pose a challenge for a good portion of the game-Affinity-specific units look cool and are powerful; I was able to 1HKO an enemy outpost being built with my Harmony Ultimate unit.Cons:-Much easier/AI much dumber than Civ 5-Gameplay changes like Happiness to Healthiness and lack of depth (no tourism/religion or equivilent) make the game feel dumbed down/lacking-Lack of unit diversity; everyone practically has the same units until they start specializing down their Affinity; even then the majority of units are just reskins with some different stats.-Color pallette is much darker; I personally found it to be unattractive after a long session.

												LIKED THE GAME, NOT THE PRICE OR HYPE THAT CAME WITH IT. DID NOT LIVE UP TO THE PROMISES.NOT WORTH IT. Keep Playing Civ 4 or 5 and wait until its on sale for a couple dollars or if ever a decent mod comes out for it. Or buy PANDORA FIRST CONTACT, I'm sure the game WITH the expansion is less then Civ BE which seems to be an expensive Bad rip-off of it.  P R O S:  Music is amazing! Really good stuff, until you declare war or something, then it turns to the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t Civ 5 had, pianos and Very Sad Elevator Music.  Sounds are amazing as well, the rifles firing and the machines working are top notch!  Very Small Download - 1.7Gb download, unpacks to around 3gb  C O N S:   The Sponsor names sound awful. Really, they sound bad. How bad? ... BAD! Very Bad. Some of them sound like something a beauty pageant contestant would come up with, like ""My favorite Planet is the SUN! And my favorite country is Polystralia! Giggle, giggle!"" NO joke, that's actually one of them. NO matter if they are possible and grammatically correct, they still sound AWFUL! Again take a look at what Alpha Centauri did. Or M.A.X. or Pandora First Contact.    The Research narration quotes are all MADE UP! We have THOUSANDS of years of recorded human history and evolution, and what do we do? We say not today wisdom! Today is the day for re-tar-ded crap to spew forth like a river of retardation where all knowledge and profound wisdom gets swept away,like watching a marathon of Honey Boo Boo or the Jersey Shore! All the Civ games until now had amazing quotes every time you do a research or wonder, Its one of the best things the games had done right. Now, all that is history. Pandora First Contact at least had very witty quotes. This game has turds in word format.    GOD AWFUL NARRATION!!! Civ 4 had Leonard Nimoy narrating the research and Wonders and whatever else the game had to narrate, it was AMAZING! Then Civ 5 came out and everyone ♥♥♥♥♥ed about the narrator, even though I still wanted Spock to be reading them, I actually liked the narrator since he sounded like Charlton Heston, but of course he wasn't, it turned out to be a guy named William Morgan Sheppard. Still, it still sounded EPIC and Awesome and if you could imagine a God-like story teller's voice telling the ordeals of Humans on their existence, you could at least imagine either one being it. ON CIV BE, they, I assume grabbed the nearest east European intern, and had her read all the lines in one sitting. Seriously! She sounds like Katia, the Russian Bride who was US$ 10 more expensive, narrating the lines with all the enthusiasm and excitement of an autistic man reading a phone book. With the budget this game had, they could of picked a real actor, or and old good one, ANYBODY who could act and narrate. I actually think she was probably amazing, spectacularly good at giving head, since that would explain why she got the part.  Last but not least YOU CANT CREATE CUSTOM SPONSORS OR IDENTITY OR ANYTHING. Endless Space, Galactic Civilization, even Master of Orion had a way of creating a custom identity with custom bonuses. Since this is all Science FICTION and all the sponsors are FICTION and the planet is FICTION, why not us play around with it? Maybe the intern who narrated it wanted it this way...  Conclusion, its still a great game, but not worth the money its costing right now at launch.( I assume its US$ 60, for me it was more, that might explain my mood at time of writing). With the exception to the music and sounds, feels like a Civ 5 Mod, nothing new brought to the table. Seems like an expensive rip-off of PANDORA FIRST CONTACT without the innovations like being able to switch weaponry on your infantry or open an Alien Gate and trigger an invasion. Wild life on the planet is crap compared to PANDORA as well, no giant Aliens the size of cities. No day night cycles.			",685,164,33,81,60,4,146

												I enjoyed the first game I played. Afterwards I felt that this game had so much potential that it didn't reach. I felt unsatisfied by its $50 price tag and reminded me why I dont preorder games. I feel that this game is a reskin from Civ 5 with a small spin-off of the original game mechanics.

												Tech web seems cool until you realize affinities mean min/maxing. The culture system is a lot better about thatThat said, the different synergies the seperate affinity armies get gives them some personality. Affinities would be fine if everything else wasnt so poorly implementedThere was literally no reason to remove luxury resources and it's a lot harder to expand without sacrificing your ""health."" Removes a lot of the reasons you used to have to do dimplomacyReally ♥♥♥♥ing drab for an alien world, even the almost entirely green aliens look vibrant against their green, brown, sand, and slate backdrop.The way unit upgrades of different affinities work could have been expanded big time but muh streamlining. Warfare still feels a lot more tactical, but highly customizable armies would've improved this 10 fold.Get used to spawning right next to each other. Apparently no city-states means squsishing everyone together instead of letting us expand and explore.This is the future you chose.

												Though not without its flaws, Beyond Earth is superior to Civilization V (itself a great game), and the closest thing to a modern Alpha Centauri on the market.  Its rich graphics, audio, and art proved delightful, leaving me wanting more.  The formula of turn-based strategy may be archaeic, but it still lets me get up for another beer or drop everything when the wife is calling.  My initial frustration at the near-identical gameplay mechanics to previous Civ iterations was overcome by the smooth graphics and slick execution.  If you're a Sid Meir fan, Civ player, or just generally like turn based strategy, this game is the best available circa 2014/15!			",24,11,0,6,10,0,14

												I liked the game, the top combat units(angel, cdnr ect) are wofully inadiqute and the bonuses are pathetic. No combat Enginer's... shame about that, no canals.... roads are inadequte for the most part. being unnessersery for costal city's and taking too long to build,some victory conditions are much easier to attchive than other's and Domination is a victory apart.Loved the Tech tree, liked the attention to affinity's being the key to unit progression found the AI to be annoying, and too persistant..... the trade fiasco has been fixed so will not complain about that. Favor's both work and are usless, finding how much they are worth is not worth it. but like the idea and the cunning of it.			",2,0,0,2,0,0,2

												Many people have panned this game under the same general premise,.. ""it's not as refined as Civ 5 with all it's addons""No, it's not.  But I still like the game, and I like alot of the things that make it different from Civ 5.  The Tech web is cool.  It gives you much more flexibility, especially early.Not sure if it's been patched since others reviewed or if it's just other people being nitpicky, but I don't have any issue distinguishing tiles on the map,.. I don't have to hover my mouse over every tile to see what it is.Good variety of units and buildings.Trade routes have an auto renew button, so once it's set, you don't have to worry about it again.Espionage has more depth to it than Civ5.  I feel like my spies have more use in BE.  Civ5 it feels more 1 dimensional,... go here and see if they have anything to steal, or sit here and kill other spies.Affinities are a good aspect to the game, gives it a little more customizationVirtues tree has some good flexibility to it for tailoring your civI like the fact that the wonders are a bit more toned down than they are in other Civ games.  Makes it less about a race to certain wonders.Some stuff that I agree needs work:Yeah, the AI faction leaders are a little dull and could use some work,.. but it's never been a primary reason why I play.Yes,  the UI could use some love, it's not as polished as Civ5In all, I enjoy the game, and I look forward to what future addons could bring to it.

												This is an awesome game.  I love the fact that it stays familiar with Civ 5 gameplay techniques and even improves upon them.  The space theme is a nice touch.  I think it has received a lot of negative reviews because people have a difficult time adjusting to the fictitious civs and people and they cannot relate to anything in this game since it has no historical references.

												I'm not going to say that this game is better or even on par with Civ V. It isn't. But it brings a new take to the Civ genre, and I believe, that with good DLCs this game can become better and deserve more praise than it has recieved. As it stands right now, it is a rehash of Civ V set in the future with some elements missing and leaving something to be desired. I still like it though, it's fresh.			",101,8,2,18,23,2,45

												Is Civilization Beyond Earth a good game?  Yes it is.  Is it the best game in the franchise? No definitely not.  Until we see some game changing DLC/expansions I think that Civilization V is the superior game especially with all of the addons purchased.  So if you are a long time fan of the franchise I'd suggest waiting on this one until it is improved.  If you are a fan of strategy games then this is a pretty solid game.  I'd rate it 6/10.  I still recommend the game as it is still pretty fun but not quite as spectacular as Civ V.			",94,10,0,13,10,0,13

												Great game.   Not quite Civ5, not quite Alpha Centauri, very well done.At 39 hours now.  I like the evolution of the genre over Civ5, and I really enjoyed civ5.  It has the mood/flavor of Alpha Centauri without the prototyping.  Affinities are a good replacement for units levelling up with technology, the tech web is similar to the tech tree but different enough to allow greater flexibility.  Virtues are straight from Civ5 and well implemented.  Overall I'd rank this 4.5/5 or so.			",59,13,1,42,4,0,37

												Well, I will start off by saying that this game does not have the fullness that most civ games have. It has much less choice in civilizations to play as. I will say however, I really enjoyed playing the game. It's fun, new, and has a great feel. To ne honest, I think it was the stepping stone to civ 6, and is really a good stand alone game.

												           So, i am just going to jump right into it and tellyou i am a huge fan of the civilization series, and yes while this game has much less play time of mine than civ 5 does, i sat back and asked myself ""What does Civ 5 have that this doesnt?"". Aside from a few very specialized things that ONLY a well aged game would worry about (such as religion) i was unable to answer this question. Why you may ask? well what i've heard from most people that like civ 5 but dislike beyond earth it is because (and im quoting a friend here) ""just a reskinned version of civ 5 with a couple of added features"". Now, i dont necessarily disagree with this statement, but is it really fair to compare a new game that doesnt have years of ageing and updating plus multiple expansions worth of content to one that does?            This new entry to the series might not be the masterpiece that will completely overshadow civ 5 and alpha centauri but that doesnt mean that they diddn't do a good job with it. I myself am planning on waiting to see how this game ages, as with all of the other civilization games that seem to age so well.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For you youngins, this game was meant to be a spiritual successor to a game known as Alpha Centauri. Alpha Centauri is still an incredible game worth checking out by the way (and that's where the problems begin). This game gets a thumbs down not only for not being able to live up to its progenitor, but also because it fails to live up to its real parent, Civ 5.Why it doesn't live up to Alpha Centauri:Alpha Centauri had a functional elevation system, you can even change elevations through terraforming later in the game.Alpha Centauri had a more robust troop customization system. Units were 'Chassis' that you could add 4 components to making for thousands of potential combos.Alpha Centauri had a virtues and ethics system that made a little more sense. Rather than pure unlock bonuses, various political philosophies had benifits and drawbacks and colored the ideology of your civ.The aliens in Alpha Centauri are an actual threat, not only that but their difficulty and agression scales with the progression of the humans based on a pollution mechanic.Why it doesn't live up to Civ 5:People have made too big of a deal out of this, but Civ 5 feels more immersive or rather the context is more relatable due to the history. There is always going to be something amusing about Jewish Germans allying Poland that BE will never replicate. That said the personalities, techs and designs of all the civs are so super boring in BE it really made this problem stand out.The AI seems significantly dumber to me. I had to raise the difficulty higher to get the same level of challenge in BE. This makes no sense to me because Civ is always going to be a much more popular and mainstream game, BE should be MORE challenging not less, for people who love civ and want more.By far the weirdest problem that BE has vs Civ is the fact that in Civ each type of point you acquire (aside perhaps from strategic resources) has a lot of utility. If you go science, culture, military, money, these resources are always useful and put you on a path to winning the game. Civ is interesting because of the way these different resources can interact. You can leverage your science to focus on culture for example, and this was expanded and refined in the expansions. In BE however there are a number of resources that just plain max out and become useless. Health can't benifit more than a certain cap (unlike hapiness in civ) and the capital resource becomes more useless even though you get exponentially more as the game goes on.Final Thoughts: What went wrong? I think when it comes to failing as a spiritual successor to Alpha Centauri, this game showed a failure of imagination to look at how to take the creative aspects of that game and bring them into the new Civ formula. It looks like they didn't even bother trying to be faithful to the source material in a lot of key areas, including the aliens and pollution, the elevation mechanics, the ethics system, and most importantly unit customization. It seems whenever they had the opportunity they chose to err on the side of Civ 5 and that resulted in basically everyone agreeing this game was a bad reskin. They aren't wrong.The more curious question is, if all deference was given to civ 5 how could they possibly fail in that regard? Really the only explanation I can come up with is the Civ formula of expantion packs. Whether it was an intrinsic part of the design plan to wait on developing certain content for expantions, Firaxis genuinely needs more money, time, and player feedback to develop the game further, the designers have gotten complacent in their ability to deliver a half-finished product that can ultimately be fixed through expansions. Players had no patience for this in BE because Alpha Centauri and Civ 5 both already exist and boast a number of features BE clearly just didn't have. I think Firaxis was planning on weathering this criticism like it did with the civ series and hoping that it would iron out the flaws, however with critics panning it, fans hating it, and new people seeing all the negative reviews on the basegame won't even consider buying and expanding it. Their gambit failed and after one expansion it looks like Firaxis won't be speaking about BE again. ",175,37,2,66,94,1,111

												Bought and played the game the day it was released.  Played it for a few days and stopped.  Year later I picked it up again and after a few hours I remembered why I stopped.Fun at first, but after a while the issues creep in.  The game is a decent improvement from Civ 5. The mechanics are identical but they were never a problem, graphics/animations/sound are good, the units are exactly what you’d expect from a Civ game (with a few interesting twists), and the tech web is an interesting addition.But, as with the last Civ game, performance gets exponentially worse the longer you play it.  I play marathon games, and by turn 900 it’s taking 2+ minutes for all NPCs to go through their turns.  The interface is clunky and unintuitive – worse than Civ 5’s since they’ve crammed in more things.  Navigating the the planet is a chore - aliens (like the barbs in Civ 5) are annoying, there are miasmas every other tile (which damage your troops), the other 1/3 of the tiles are canyons or mountains which your troops can't traverse (you'd think if you have the tech to colonize another planet you might be able to get over a hill).  And ffs let me rebind keys.  Let me use WASD to control the camera and hotkey things the way I want.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After reading the reviews for this game I was really hesitant to purchase it, but when it became free-to-play, my dreams came true; I would actually get to test out the game before I bought it.Now, a LOT of people are saying that this is too similar to CIV 5 and that the gameplay is sub-par, but I don't think that. CIV:BE, while sharing a lot of aspects from CIV 5, is a completely different game. This game does not focus on a historical context at all. The methods in which things are done are different. New Concepts: Hoards - large groups of aliens together in ""nests""Technology Web - Instead of an almost linear timeline, this acts as a web. There are sub-points to each point in the web. You are not required to research the sub-points to move to the next major point. They are completely optional. Which direction you take, however can aid you in how you win the game. Orbital Layer - Fight and defend from aboveMiasma - A thick poison fog that harms your workers/soldiers/etc when standing in it until clearedFavors - Need a resource, but don't have anything to offer yet?

If a player captures all the other colony capitals while retaining control of their own, they achieve this victory. Players who don’t have control of their original capital can’t earn this victory.Contact: The player makes contact with a benevolent alien race by discovering certain sciences and building certain Wonders.Emancipation: Achieved by players pursuing the Supremacy Path. The player constructs a warp gate and sends a “liberation army” back to Old Earth.Promised Land: Earned via the Purity Path. The player constructs a warp gate and brings the population of Old Earth through to the “promised land” of the new world.Transcendence: The option for players on the Harmony Path. This victory is earned when a player triggers the merging of the planet’s latent sentience with the consciousness of all living things.In my opinion, while this game is NOT perfect right now, it has a lot of wiggle room to expand into something great. However, it is a game that I recommend because it is not CIV 5.			",37,15,1,13,18,0,15

												Not as good as SMAC. Prettier - but obtuse, derivative and more dated than the far superior original.The gameplay is a Civ 5 mod, with perpetual questions and no clear way of answering them. The factions are one dimensional and the choices are oblique at best.Sample: You allow some people to break off and become Augmented. Will you allow Trade with them? No.THEN YOU MUST KILL THEM!....wut?Alpha Centurai is still more gripping, and with more nerve stapling.			",230,68,0,52,49,2,52

												The simple Yes/No answer is not really enough when it comes to this type of game review. If there was a ""maybe"" button, I would choose that for this game. It is not a bad game, but it lacks the same depth and playability as Civ V. It's got some great ideas and fun concepts, but there are too many parts that either don't make sense, or just fail entirely. The upgrading of units is a good concept in its self, however it is also quite restrictive. In early to mid-game you have a very small selection of unit types that are quite weak and by end game a wider range of powerful units become available. By this point however, unless you deactivate the victory conditions, you are not left with a huge amount of time to use them. There is also the big problem of Affinity specific resource. You choose your affinity quite early in the game, however you may find by mid-game you do not have enough of the affinity specific resource and so you cannot build the new units you have spent so long waiting for.There is also the issue of the tech tree, which is just not user friendly. You really must take time to plan out your discoveries at the start of the game, otherwise you could find yourself missing vital technologies. Also, due to the affinity upgrade system, you end up targeting the affinity technologies to get the better units, and so fall behind in other basic areas.The intrigue system was quite an exciting concept with some great sounding abilities at the higher levels, however you rarely get to use them (if ever). You can place one agent per city and give them missions that will raise the intrigue level in a city if they succeed (level 0 to 5). The problem is that it takes far too long to raise the level and relies on multiple races targeting the same city. This means you tend to end up only using the level 0 through 2 skills, which are just a bit dull.In all I was disappointed by this instalment of Civ. I love Civ 5 and just feel they have missed the target with this update - a real shame as Alpha Centuri was a great game. I recommend you save your money, and get Civ 5 instead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Many reviewers expected Beyond Earth to be Alpha Centauri 2, which it is not. Neither it is a Civilization V mod. It IS a new game, which, although share some features of Civ5 (hex grid, battle system, unit classes, wonders, resources, neutral units) and AC (ideologies, sci-fi techs), is played differently.The main focus in BE is on affinity (ideology) choices. As you specialise towards a particular victory type, you need to focus on specific technologies. Each next progress level gives you an affinity point, which in turn provides you with useful perks (upgrades) for your units + bonuses. These specific perks will radically change your units as you progress on specific affinity path (alien-like units, machine-like units or human units).The culture works in a similar way as in Civ5. After certain level of culture is reached, you can acquire virtues (4 virtue categories – Might, Prosperity, Knowledge and Industry - in 3 tiers), which work in a similar way as social policies in Civ 5. There are synergy bonuses for focusing on same category virtues or same tier virtues.Also, there are quests, research pods and exploration areas, which substantially can boost your progress over the time. As well as the destruction of aliens and alien nests, especially with certain Might virtues.The victory types are following: Domination - conquer all other players; Contact - contact alien civilization; Transcendence (requires Harmony specialisation)  - civilization fully adapts to the new planet and becomes enlightened; Promised Land (requires Purity specialisation) - bring Earth population to the new planet; Emancipation (requires Supremacy specialisation) - conquer (""free"") Earth.So, it's a completely different setting in Beyond Earth. And you require a different approach from what you're used to in Civ5. Although, the same basic rules are still in place: e.g., a) food is population, population is everything; b) science is progress, progress is victory.When I played Beyond Earth for the first time, there were certain innovations that annoyed me, but after playing a while, I got used to them and they started to make sense for me.For example:1. Technology tree is replaced with technology web, which makes it hard to find things, unless you haven't played few sessions. However, with filters and search option, it becomes quite easy to find what you're looking for and to plan your strategy.2. Miasma - spore clouds on some tiles that damage human units. This was really annoying in the beginning. However with right technologies, it actually is kind of cool way to have something to transform. And besides, it makes sense, that alien planet is initially hostile towards humans, but as human population adapts to the new habitat, it learns to use the nature for its own good.3. Aliens – very hostile, very procreative and (some of them) very strong. Initially, it is very hard to avoid them or kill them, so it might be annoying experience for beginners, but, again, with right technologies and strategy, there are ways to overcome this problem and turn it for your own good. After you have the right technologies and units, it's a great opportunity to gain XP for your army. You can have neutral relationship with aliens (by not destroying their nests), but I have never tried this option, because they are always in your way and threaten you on each turn.4. Colour balance - blue and green are dominant colours, it's hard to distinguish miasma and resources. By turning resource yields and icons on, it's possible to minimise this problem, but, still, why couldn't they make miasma red or purple?5. There is a radical shift towards agressive playstyle compared to Civ5. It's almost a must to constantly build units and to defend or attack somebody. It's not something I was used to in Civ5. And at first I didn't really like it. But then again, the overall gameplay is more versatile and balanced and the player gets to use and enjoy all of his strengths in a versatile way. It really freshens up the TBS feel in this game.6. AI behaviour. AI players are either nasty or stupid or both. The diplomatic relationship and deals do not make any sense. There is no solution for this. Just forget about reasonable trade offers, when playing Beyond Earth. You're on your own. I hope Firaxis will change this with future updates.So, with that said, I think Beyond Earth is really a great game. Not perhaps as good as Civilization V, but it certainly feels fresh, runs smoothly and each game session offers a different experience. I would recommend it to all Civilization fans, not perhaps for its full price, but with atleast -40% discount (30 €), it's worth the price even in its current Vanilla state. However, I do hope there will be new expansions, scenarios and maps.My overall rating: 9/10.			",139,38,1,27,5,2,24

												After reading the reviews for this game I was really hesitant to purchase it, but when it became free-to-play, my dreams came true; I would actually get to test out the game before I bought it.Now, a LOT of people are saying that this is too similar to CIV 5 and that the gameplay is sub-par, but I don't think that. CIV:BE, while sharing a lot of aspects from CIV 5, is a completely different game. This game does not focus on a historical context at all. The methods in which things are done are different. New Concepts: Hoards - large groups of aliens together in ""nests""Technology Web - Instead of an almost linear timeline, this acts as a web. There are sub-points to each point in the web. You are not required to research the sub-points to move to the next major point. They are completely optional. Which direction you take, however can aid you in how you win the game. Orbital Layer - Fight and defend from aboveMiasma - A thick poison fog that harms your workers/soldiers/etc when standing in it until clearedFavors - Need a resource, but don't have anything to offer yet? Give favors. This allows them free resources at the expense of this favor later in the game, however.Quests - Tasks to complete set off by an event that give you added bonuses.Choices - A part of quests, gives you the oportunity to choose how your technology works. (The Thorium Reactor giving you either +2 Energy OR +1 Production depending upon your choice)""Reskinned"" Concepts: Health - Previously HappinssAliens - Previously Barbarians (7 different species of aliens, however)Energy - Previously GoldAffinities - Similar to Ideology, but not quite. /almost/ a new feature.Covert Operations - Previously SpiesIn my opinion, all of these reskins were concepts that needed to stay, but needed to be altered to fit with the game.

												Where to start with this title? Firstly I'll get it out of the way and say it's a good game, no question. It's far from perfect but if you like civilization then you will like this title.I fear the single downfall of this game lies in the development. It's as if Firaxis did not have a large enough budget to fully complete this game to make it unique. There are a couple things that bother me with the game so far, the voice acting and it's oh-so-similar CIV 5 likeness. Maybe this was my own fault coming in to this game expecting something COMPLETELY different or something similar to Alpha Centauri. Not that any of these reasons are terrible but I think I worked it up in my head that this game was going to be the perfect blend of Alpha Centauri And Civ 5. It's not, it's good but far from a breakout series. The sole thing I would say about the voice acting is that it needs more work. Each civ does have a unique voice actor but when wonders are complete or you're read a definition you get the voice actor who also voices the Kavithan Protectorate. Should this bother me? I think I was just spoiled with Civ 4 and Civ 5.On to the good stuff - There were a few things I really liked almost immediately after starting. The futuristic theme lends more capabilities and options for the familiar civ player to start with. I love planetfall, this is basically the enactment of your ship touching down and establishing your first colony on the planet you choose. Before this you are allowed to tweak how you start and what starting benefits your sponsor and civilization get. These options range from scientific, cultural to militaristic benefits to help you mould your civ before you start planetfall, Pretty cool stuff.The addition to upgrading your military was a very nice change. Depending on how you steer your civilization this can define what type of militaristic units you get. The 3 directions you can split in to are determined by how you research your technologies. Researching technologies can give you points towards an affinity which can affect your military in very unique ways. This is in addition to veterancy which was not removed but instead improved on.Overall I would say this is a great title. I have been playing it since release and don't foresee stopping any time soon.Go out and get it!			",459,77,20,118,91,5,122

												Civilization Beyond Earth truly deserves the title of spiritual successor of Alpha Centauri. Although it requires a bit of unit diversity, even with the upgrades, you'd still miss the custom unit creation that was available in Alpha Centauri. Factions are diverse but not too distinct from each other, which makes them somewhat easier to get used to quickly. Gameplay and turn times are much smoother than in Civ 5, especially in later phases of the game in a very large map you'd feel the difference of ai completing their turns much quicker.As i read the comments i see people who haven't played Alpha Centauri but fans of Civ series are a bit confused and calling this an expansion pack of sorts. It simply isn't. Just take it as exploring, or rather migrating to an alien planet because earth is no more habitable and imagine all that 'future tech' in Civ games are new set of techs in here. Sure it takes time to get used to but it doesn't prevent it being so much fun.It will become a legendary successor when they add more factions, a little more unit diversity and some other dlc add ons but it's still a must buy right off the bat for any Civ or Alpha Centauri fan.Update as of 23.11.2016 - It's still the closest thing to Alpha Centauri whether you like it or not.

												I usually like the Civilization series of games, but this one has a couple of serious problems.First of all, when the game ends it just gives you the option to go back to the main menu. The ""Just one more turn"" button does not work.  Secondly, when you lose, you don't see any feedback about 1) who won  2) how you did and 3) why you lost. The rest of the game is fairly decent. However, the ""hey, screw you, you lose"" aspect of the game makes it feel like you just wasted a number of hours playing. At this point I can't recommend the game. If Firaxis gets their head out of whatever orifice they have it stuffed up, they should be able to fix this problem fairly easily. At that point I'll revisit this review.			",119,19,2,15,52,3,109

												Let me start off by saying that like so many others here, I am a huge fan of the Civ series. I was a bit dissapointed by having forked over $50 to only receive an unfinished game. For half the price I could have gotten a generic clone that recently came out (look on steam). This is most likely due to Firaxis' business model of releasing expansions for their game. To be honest, this will probably be the last time I ever buy a game that is not a complete edition, because it is simply not worth it. Civilization 5 was amazing as a stand alone, but the expansions made it even better! This is just not the case here...I hope they can salvage this title, because it is pretty emberassing.

												Charging full price for a mod of civ 5 that's worse in every way.Remember all the cool content and extra effort that sid meier's games used to have, like the little movies after finishing wonders (civ 2,3 & 4), the well written dialog and attention to detail (Alpha Centauri) and god tier voice acting from Leonard Nimoy and William Morgan Sheppard accompanied by music you could listen to for hours on end it was so good.Nope, that's all gone now, welcome to the future, now with 90% less effort.It's all screaming Indian women and UI's that burn your eyes with how horribly dark and unreadable they are, Sid meier's should be dead so ""spinning in his grave"" references could be made, that's just how far from grace this franchise has fallen.The game play so far is a total mess, easily winnable through mind numbing micromanagement (the trade system in Civ 5 was a terrible Idea, and it's even worse when you have 3 per city asking for directions every 30 turns (get more then 7 city's and you'll have to order them about every turn) through the garbage UI where they've remove simple features like sorting by resource delta)Wonders are now just flat stat sticks, the bonuses compared to previous civ games where they could change the flow of the game relegates them down to completely pointless, and easily reproduced by land tiles and general buildings.my only consolation is they will continue to polish this turd with future DLC... but it's potential will never be more then a well polished turd.

												Tons of hours off-line.Alright, so here are the questions I wanted to ask before buying this game.WOW, IS THE GAME REALLY AS BAD AS THE RATINGS SUGGEST???Most (not all) of the negative ratings are people uber♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥they paid $50-60 dollars for the base game back in the day.  If you paid $50-60 for the base game, you'd be uber♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ too.  If, however, you paid $20 like me (or even less with recent sales), you'd be fine with your purchase.  The base game really isn't that bad; it's not particularly memorable, but pay $15-20, and you should avoid any buyer's remorse.DOES THE DLC HELP? IT'S KIND OF EXPENSIVE.Yes! Rising Tide boosts Beyond Earth from an okay game to a very good game.  If you even remotely liked Beyond Earth, pick up Rising Tide immediately.  If you have neither, you should be able to get both Beyond Earth and Rising Tide together for around $40-50 in a future sale.  While the DLC might have too high a price tag, the two items combined are definitely worth $40-50.LOTS OF NEGATIVE REVIEWS ARE SAYING TO STICK WITH CIVILIZATION V.  SHOULD I BOTHER GETTING BEYOND EARTH IF I ALREADY HAVE CIV V?Most defintiely.  Beyond Earth is NOT just a poor man's Civ V with a space skin thrown on.  Instead, I would say it's built on a Civ V chassis.  Players will recognize many of the same concepts and game mechanics, but also notice significant differences.  Just a few: 1) ""aliens"" function quite differently from ""barbarians"" in older games 2) the tech ""tree"" is really more of a ""web"" now, and many of the technological choices have no equivalent in previous Civ games.  They didn't take the existing tree and say, ""Ooooooh, let's just call it 'space bronze working' now.""3) affinity levels -- how your civilization will relate to the Old Earth and your new home -- have a significant impact on the types of buildings, military units, etc available to you.4) there are some cool new types of victory scenarios.  Ahhh, nothing like the feeling of sending giant alien hybrids through a warp gate back to old Earth to ""emancipate"" them from their petty bickering.It's a decent base game, well worth a $15-20 investment.  As with Civ V, I think it will become a truly great game once all the DLC dust has cleared.  Jump on the bandwagon now and enjoy the ride.			",66,22,1,42,9,0,24

												They released this game to early. Its clearly missing dialog when talking to other factions. You cannot alter the amount of energy you are trading. AI's will offer you trades then you click accept then the refuse the trade. The choices you chose for your units are not really unique and there is only one newly conceptulized ranged unit. They fixed a few things like you won't see your wonders in the water any more but the wonders are very lack luster and there is no reason to build them. You just wait until they are built and then take over the city that made it. But still they are not really worth it. I have a feeling like they are planning something like they did with 5 and making it so you need to get a expansion.			",26,11,2,17,11,0,15

												They released this game to early. Its clearly missing dialog when talking to other factions. You cannot alter the amount of energy you are trading. AI's will offer you trades then you click accept then the refuse the trade. The choices you chose for your units are not really unique and there is only one newly conceptulized ranged unit. They fixed a few things like you won't see your wonders in the water any more but the wonders are very lack luster and there is no reason to build them. You just wait until they are built and then take over the city that made it. But still they are not really worth it. I have a feeling like they are planning something like they did with 5 and making it so you need to get a expansion.			",26,11,2,17,11,0,15

												First of all, I have to say that I am a huge fan of Civilization games. BE starts very promising, but after a serious amount of rounds the game is repetitive and in my opinion , a bit pointless. The choices in the tech web are giving me the feeling that they are random and they don't have a serious impact on the game. Also, after so many rounds , the aliens are still doing the same stuff. I feel that the battle between another civilization it's a bit meaningless , because you left from Earth to find a better place to live, not to conquer. I am sorry to say that, but the game is boring. I am going to stick with Civ V. I hope in the future the DLCs will help the game, but i am not willing to gamble another 40-50 € for this game. If you love Civ V , don't buy this. The space theme it doesn't work for the nature of this game.			",286,61,5,49,27,6,45

												It's hard to describe this game and give it a grade. On the one hand, it was a lot of fun playing through my first victory and going through the tech tree and so forth as Kavitha. But it just felt so....Civ V-like. Yes, the graphics are different, the sponsors are different, and there's different buildings, units, and wonders. But the mechanics feel like Civ V-reskin. First off the good stuff: I like how the minor powers/city states only occupy one tile. You were probably annoyed one way or another when Monaco took that fountain of youth tile or another natural wonder. It's good to see that the sponsors get a lot of land to use. Also, I like the outpost criteria. I think that should be in Civ 6. Giving an output/settlement a few turns to fully develop is something unique. Rome wasn't built in a day right? :)I also really like the quotes. Now the things I don't like: boring leaders (they sound dull and uninspiring), boring units (there's only to be 3 types of units, vs unique units for each civ in Civ V), boring music (I played my own music when I play, and I  - Civ V's music was awesome with the peace and war themes), boring wonders (I had to look through all the wonders the first time, although it's quite easy to see that the ones that need more production are the wonders), some virtues are OP (propserity - bottom right with -25% health - and the other health benefits in that tree, make that area the new Tradition tree. YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT IF YOU WANT TO WIN. YOU HAVE NO CHOICE, unless you want to enter -20 health), and by far, this feels like an unfinished game. When I won through victory, the ending was so anticlimatic, and I went ""That's it?"". It's quite obvious that similar mechanics like religion will be in the game eventually: I want to worship Space Gandhi. But until I can, I can't really recommend this game at the regular price. Review subject to change with future patches and expansions.			",57,8,34,4,30,5,16

												Beyond Earth feels like an entry title into the series. With that I mean that it sure is a nice game on some fronts and it rolls with the alien theme, it let's you down if you are looking for that Brave New World vibe. The game feels and acts like a reskinned civ 5. The units let your expectations down, the year is somewhere in the future, and at this point still you have 'melee' units which in civ 5 style exhange hits with other units. The addition of satelites is a nice touch, however that feels like its the only thing added. You still have your Civ 5 units being a Melee unit, Ranged unit, Artilery unit and cavalery unit. However instead of the upgrades of these units being tied to your technology they are now tied to your affinity (basicly your ideology).How I do like the affinity system it does force your research, and strategy with that into a singular path. Since discovering certian technologies grant you affinity points you are forced to pick those techs up, which give you a false hope of an immense tech web with lots of choices. On top of this you'll find that (especcially) on higher difficulties that you don't have a free choice of affinity, with that your playstyle as well, either. You will be looking at what strategic resources are nearby and you will pick the affinity that goes with the specific strategic resource which happens to be in abbundance near your landing zone. On top of this the unique feel you used to have for your civilization is gone. Leaders talk less and feel less interactive as well. Furthermore instead of the leader sitting in their ""Throne room"" they now just show the leader without any background. The uniqueness of your civilization and your games you'll play are gone as well since there are just 8 factions. If you enjoy playing larger maps then these games will always be with the same factions. Factions have a random personality now as well it seems, so no more war mongering shaka. Along with the uniqueness of your civ missing, you'll find yourself looking for a lot more if you compare this to Civ 5. The victory system is simplified now, you have 3 basic victory types, 1 is bound to your affinity (basicly build a wonder after researching the right techs), 1 is bound to finding an artifact using the new scout system and the final one is domination. However the first two victories basicly feel like research X asap and perform action Y asap after that. So dumbed down you have 2 victory paths which is a huge letdown to the 4 victories in civ 5, which also felt unique in their playstyle. Performance wise civ BE runs great. I have had no crashes and it doesn't seem very taxing on the machine either. The game looks very nice from an observers viewpoint. However from a players viewpoint this is no longer the case. Be prepared for a lot of blue. The techweb feels like a blue hive which includes vague options and lacks color in general. You really can't find any tech or wonder or any other distinction in the tech web easily. On top of this the overall view of the game is messy. You cant really see terrain clearly and this results in you hovering with your mouse over all the terrain to see the yields (or turn the show yields option on). All in all this game is a great let down for the expectations set up by its predecessor. If you are new to the series you can pick this up to get a general feel of the Civ series. However your bucks are better spent on the full edition of civ 5 which all in all still feels like a superior game. Rating = 4 / 10, the game feels like a rushed product where Firaxis did not utilise any of the experience build up in making the previous civilization games. The good:* The terrain looks good visiually and offers a nice change* The new system of picking your cargo etc allows for more diverse games* The alien system makes ""barbarians"" a some what city state like faction of their ownThe bad:* The game feels messy and lakcs distinctive features in all parts (tech web, buildings, general overview, etc.)* Very  low amount of factions in the game of whoms abilities feel lack-luster for some and overpowered for others* Low diversity of units, everything is dumbed down to your basic units which use the affinity system for upgraded units* Units and buildings dont feel like what you'd expect from space faring civilizations* No more religion (or new equivalent)* Less diverse games by less victory types* Leaders feel a lot less personal and even more as just annoying pop ups* Spacing between civilizations (map size) seems less forcing you to have contested borders relatively fast. Short conclusion:Rating 4/ 10. Stick to civ 5 Brave new world, either as a new player or as an experienced player. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												$89.99 is what you pay for this game if you're from Aus and what you are buying is a breath of fresh air that quickly turns stale.You will still enjoy playing this, but not as much as you would enjoy playing civ5.The game feels as though it was released too soon with half the content missing, it plays like a slower civ5 because it's basically a modded version.A disappointing release out of firaxis, with a price tag that's double its worth			",52,3,0,4,3,0,9

												At first glance the game does seem drastically different than Civilization 5. There seems to be quite a lot of negative reviews but I personally find it to be a very pleasant addition to the Civilization series. I started playing the civilization games way back when I was in middle school and Civilization 3 had just came out. Here was my experience of this futuristic take on the civilization series:At first I had a hard time trying to get focus on the game and understand what was going on. I played very on and off for a few days and stopped playing for about a week. I later resumed playing the game again and took the same approach I did to learning civilization 3. Once I understood the new mechanics and got a handle on the terrain, resources, improvements, and the daunting orbital aspect ( which actually turned out to be very simple to understand and is a fantastic element I have come to enjoy. Especially because you can create resources ;D ) so on and so forth of the intricate elements of the game. Once I played through one game, all the way (win or lose and I actually lost this one though it was close haha I started my first game on Vostok difficulty) I honestly have not been able to stop playing it. A lot of the nuisances that were present in civ 4 and civ 5 such as battling happiness and upgrading military units to compete with higher level ai (these are just a couple).I really like how the virtues truly give you the ability to customize your sponsor (civilization). When the virtue tree has 2 bonuses branching to a higher tier bonus, you no longer need both of those bonuses to grab that higher tier and only need to pick one. The way units upgrade is a really cool approach as too. Again, it gives you full customization of your nation. Even when behind you can still put up a fight, albeit a struggle, but it is doable and winnable. It also gives hope to being able to win a game when quite a ways behind. The instant upgrade of all units once the upgrade has been earned (affinity level reached a certain level for a particular unit) is a very nice adaptation. I remember in civ 5 losing games becuase I had no money to upgrade units and continue to fund new units. Ultimately, I found this game to be very challenging, rewarding, and so many different ways to play the game and enjoy! I highly reccomend this game for someone willing to put in the time it takes to learn a game. Even if you are a civilization veteran, approach this game with some new eyes and it is all the more rewarding. ",6,0,0,4,4,0,18

Pros-*Choices at the start of the game - (e.g. +2 food, production ect in each city) with ""quests"" giving optional bonuses for different buildings (e.g. an extra point of culture for monuments or no maintenence cost for them) allowing greater specialisation. you are never limited by the fact there is only 8 factions. Unlike civ 5 where some factions were especially powerful perhaps even inbalanced.*Ideologies - The three main ideologies are all realistic, compelling and ultimately lead to different styles of play and win conditions. Solving one of my main gripes with CIv 5 in that your civ almost always favoured a victory so doing your best to win involved simply repeating a tried and tested strategy.*Tech web - While confusing at first glance and for a couple of playthroughs time it really does allow you to specialise. In civ 5 that one player with the highest science got first dibs on every wonder, not anymore!*Aliens replace barbarians - More than just a cosmetic change the aliens are not inherently hostile and will treat you differently based on how you treat them. Some are hilariously overpowered at the start of the game but can be avoided. The difficulty setting probably has an effect too.*Orbital layer - Allows another layer of military conquest where you can rain death from above with massive units or orbital weapons. But also satilites that can create new resources on blank tiles allowing you to develop the map in very new ways. I would love to see this be pushed further to allow a more earthlike climate for the purity ideology.Cons-*The game is outright missing some of the features that came with DLC for civ 5 and will probably end up being DLC later down the line. Including: religion, natural wonders, world congress, tourism/culture victory.*The game does not have distinct phases like Civ 5 which were based on different eras of human civilisation. As such it the game doesnt really have the same flow of technological advancement making it hard to see how well you are doing in comparison to your rivals. In times of peace this can make the game feel extremely detached almost like no progress is being made at all, at least in war you can see new units duking it out!*Unlike barbarians the aliens do not not gain any new units over the course of a game. Making them very strong to begin with but the weaker ones quickly become little more than wasted movement points as your units effortlessly plough through them.*Very little interaction with AI players - The only new addition being that the AI will compliment you if you same the same attitude towards the Aliens or for choosing the same ideology. Civ 5 was lacking in this regard as well, it simply isnt interesting to deal with them in any way.*Visuals while functional arent exactly amazing. Beyond earth being a stand alone game rather than a paid DLC for Civ 5 means there was an opportunity to up the visuals, which was clearly missed as the game looks to be on the same level of graphical fidelity as civ 5.tl:drDifferent enough from Civ 5 to be worth trying (I have enjoyed it thus far), similar enough to make you realise whats missing or hasnt been improved.

												Hello readers.At the time of making this, I have had only 6 or so hours of game time. Normally this would be far to little to write accurate review, and you are right!The first thing I did when I start the game was of course the settings, see how everything is set. First thing I noticed, no 1920x1080 resolution supported in full screen. I got confused, which game in 2014 didn't have it?!I went on the web and found out this is normal for those with a specific refresh rate of a their monitor, I guess this somehow got pets the superb Q/A testing.Fine, I will play it in windows modeI looked at the choices I could get, and I noticed that you only have 8 Civs, this was kinda mediocre to me when you compare it to the previous game, and because they aren't  the 'known' civ's of the world, it felt very lacking.The bonuses of each civs as well made them far less unique then I thought. But ill just go ahead and pick something.After 'personalising' my faction ( which with the limited choices you cannot really call it that ) I entered  the game!First thing I noticed, no awesome voice overs of William Morgan Sheppard or  Leonard Nimoy.I started, settled, and explored with my unit, already felt a bit CiV 5 but that doesn't have to be bad. I found something to use my explorer on, started to dig around and then it already started, next turn, next turn and next turn. Not much going on.I started fiddling with the UI and noticed so much is missing and its all very blend, while in previous civs it all looked quite nice with art and stuff, this game is just made out of bars that anyone can do! The minimap is very annoying coloured, everything is very dark which means you got to suck the player in for that next turn. Then suddenly other civs joined, landed on the map and I could see where they were,  meaning no exploring what so ever to find that other civilization. Played some more, heard my first research completed, no cool pop up, a very average voice over ( sorry.. ) made a new city with a oversized settler, started seeing the other civs units, all the same, as me, no uniqueness. I started looking some more throught the UI, Affinity, Virtues, Researching.I had a quest popping up asking me for a station to drop near me, I made my choice, it dropped down and well that was it, you can trade with this station but for the rest it does nothing. Imagen a city state without workers and units around it while growing and feeling sort of alive, no here they are just dead buildings. Speaking of quests, at first, I loved em, they do give a bit of lore BUT they the bonus is always very small, in the end, its just picking something you go for or what you need. You quickly just pick and forget.While I don't mind the Web of researching, its not good and it is very boring, while you see cool artworks from CiV 5, this again feels really cheap.Other civs started to ask for things, when I read what they had to say, it was pure copy paste from CiV 5.. and that is when I started to have enough. And I saw flaw after flaw and flaw. Wonders, I build them, never knowing I actually made one! Why? They aren't 'wonderful' I honestly thought they were just a building! When I started upgrading units, ah a bigger gun! Awesome!...150 turns in, trade spam became annoying, you can have as low as 2 trade routes on a city.(as you can tell by my writing I start to become a bit more unforgiving, exactly how I felt during my play session for the first time )I noticed that sure, affinity will make your units look different in end game, but they will still be exactly the same as any other civ that has it, while I know that in CiV 5, modern age it is the same as well, before that you had a couple of ages feeling relatively unique compared to the rest. Mods made this even better.As you have noticed I said nothing about the aliens, that's because they have nothing to do with the game, they are there, being annoying but nothing else, even when you kill nest after nest, nothing. I then gave up on the game, it was just to boring, to tedious and it has no soul, i feels like almost no effort was made into this.I do have one positive, I have to say, is the music, its beautiful  and I am 100% sure, that's the only reason I played it for this long.I will not recommend this to anyone, not at full price, perhaps at 10 euros max. I will also never recommend this to a CiV Veteran, because he will see this too. As far as it goes for me, this is a MOD, and a bad one at that.			",77,15,1,38,18,0,47

												First of all the game is not bad per se but for me it is lacking overall in general and especially compared to its predecessor Civilization V. The first thing you will realize is that most of the game is just like Civ V so there is not really a change there. But unlike Civ V, especially with all its addons, has a lot more to offer than Beyond Earth. The different civs are only a few and not really interesting. The difference between the civs is also negligible. The progression via affinity according to Supremacy, Harmony, or Purity is a nice idea but they are only 3 options compared to the numerous in Civ V via religion or culture. If you wanted you could win the game within a short time because the different goals, with the exception of domination maybe, is fairly easy. The tech you need to research does not take too long and then, if you have a strong town with good production, build the wonder fairly quickly and after about 75 turns it is over. Meaning the computer can also win easily in higher difficulty. I do not know if the AI actually does that because I did not get to those above normal difficulties yet. Marathon feels like normal speed in Civ V and is over quickly as well.The diversity of units is very limited. You basically get 1 unit of each type. 1 ship, 1 plane, 1 artillery, 1 infantry and so on.In general diversity is what I think is the problem that is most lacking. Nothing that they cannot add with mods or updates but at this point I rather play Civ V or Endless Legends.			",77,10,2,34,19,2,55

												So far after 100 plus hours of gameplay of Beyond Earth I'd give this Civilization game five stars. I like the whole space concept and the different ways to victory. Plenty of fun achievements to keep you busy for days even weeks. I wish you could choose allies during war to help you destroy the enemy and choose your terms during peace talks, other than that top notch game.			",3,2,0,2,4,0,6

												I'm giving this a 7 out of 10, because as a stand-alone game, C:BE a good 4X strategy game. But, I'm so used to the masterpiece that is Civilization 5 : Brave New World, that this rendition sadly pales into insignificance. Many of the features that made Civ 5 what it was have either been heavily simplified or removed entirely - good examples being the unit variety and faction identities/bonuses.Good/New features :I like the addition of the orbital layer - it adds another dynamic to empire building and warfare.The new Affinities (Ideologies) are a different spin on Civ 5, and I think do give you a feel of what your Civ represents in terms of values.Miasma - it feels like a major pain to start out, and if you play as Harmony, you can turn it to your advantage - a nice touch.The Virtues tree (social upgrades) are a nice touch giving you the option to progress either in a single tree or multiple trees - each having bonus boosts (i.e. you get bonuses for spreading across multiple trees - unlike Civ 5).The Quests - it adds a nice way to customise buildings to your specific playstyle, and gives nice little boosts to your empire. Ultimately though, it's a mechanism to reduce the number of buildings in the game.The favour system in diplomacy is a nice touch. If you don't need anything from another faction, they trade you an IOU which can be called in later.The visual appeal is a nice change from dull and boring earth :o)  Although, the graphics overall aren't really an upgrade over Civ 5 (not that it was needed tbh).Things that disappoint me :The tech web - although a decent idea, it just seems to be a random collection of upgrades that you stumble into. I never get a feel that I'm progressing towards something meaningful. Example : In Civ 5, acquiring Dynamite was a major boost for your Artillery capabilities, and you would often divert resources to getting it as early as possible if you were planning a war. You don't get that feeling in C:BE.The wonders are........Meh. They are small and fairly insignificant boosts that have little synergy with each other. Again, Civ 5 often required you to build/acquire certain wonders to achieve certain victories.The lack of ""atmosphere"". This is a new planet shrouded in mystery! The quest system is good for customisation, but they could have done so much more with it to give you that feeling that this is a weird and wonderful new place that you have to grapple with to get the most out of it. The Aliens are basically the ""Barbarians"" of Civ 5 - but they seem to flip a coin as to whether or not to attack you. Once you get to mid-game, they are irrelevant as a force - you might as well terminate them on sight, even playing as Harmony! Would have been much better if they made the natural inhabitants an AI-only faction in their own right, and link quests to them depending on your Affinity.The ""health"" system. It's basically ""happiness"" from Civ 5, but seems to be more forgiving. You can expand very aggressively in C:BE and not suffer too much. If you did that in Civ 5, you'd find life very difficult if your people weren't happy. The ""softening"" of this expansion bottleneck means that you are engaging far less with your neighbours to acquire happiness or manipulate the game in your favour via a league of nations/UN - oh wait, luxury goods don't exist anymore either. Why do I need to talk to anyone again?The NPC stations; the C:BE equivalent of City States. They are a trading option for a single trade route - nothing more. You don't fight over them. They don't fight for you. They don't consume land and foil your best laid expansion plans. You can't take them over. They don't give you a bigger voice at the table of international diplomacy - nope...they just sit there and give you a few extra resource points - and if you're unlucky they appear out of the blue and stop you from planting an outpost where you want it. Meh.Economy - I never feel like Energy (Gold) is a bottleneck. If you had an abundance of gold in Civ 5, you could do so much with it. If you weren't a gold friendly faction, you'd sometimes struggle to make ends meet - to field that Dynasty crushing army.  Where there were big gold sinks in Civ 5 like maintaining alliances and control over city states, upgrading units etc - the absence of this limits the use of excess energy to rush buying units and buildings.  So far - Energy is just something I casually look at. It's rarely in the negative per turn. It's just not a resource that needs to be carefully managed like in Civ 5.Lack of unit diversity - There are not many units at all. Only different ways to customise them via increases in Affinity. It's like the buildings - less of them, but you can customise them.All in all I'm disappointed - After Civ 5 and X-COM, Firaxis were the only software house I'd ever pre-order anything from. I'll be thinking twice now.That said - this game does have potential for modding and future expansions. My advice is to park it until that happens. Civ 5 only became truly great after the second expansion.For people who are new to the Civ franchise, you'd probably enjoy this game.  For Civ 5 veterans like myself, it's a bit of a let down that leaves you chomping at the bit for an expansion.			",21,5,3,19,14,0,22

												Sadly, this is the worst CIV game yet - all the problems and issues of 5 - no unit stacking, end game performance issues etc. but with added graphical issues and constant crashing. Every run of the game has crashed for me at least once so far - without save games, it would be impossible to play a game through.  The aliens do not add interest - they are just an annoyance, like permanently present barbarians.  I regret buying this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was so hyped for this game, i'm a Civ veteran, been playing every game in the series since the first Civilization game. I have over 150 hours on Civ5. So i was looking forward to this game as an advancement to the franchise.What i got was a cash in on a famous franchise, that has all the mechanics of civ 5, but none of the personality or features. And some people will say that it will get better in the expansions, but even civ 5 vanilla had more soul, features, and appeal than this game does in it's current state. It feels hurried and un finished.To put it in perspective, i have more hours put into Euro Truck Simulator 2 than this game =/Very disappointed, i feel a little betrayed by one of my favorite game studios.

												I foolishly decided to trust the positive reviews and am now left with a buggy and to be honest, a rushed game. Sid meier's is making a habit of releasing unfinished games that require patching and then releasing a paid patch cough cough brave new world to try and drain his fans of their earnings. This game is lets face it dull, the graphics are vibrant but not in the good way as i often felt my eyes being strained. The ads show off a wide new range of victories but once you play the game you'll know thats its just bs. These 'new' victories are basically science and domination victories, all 4 of the new victories require extensive research and are basically the equivalent of building a space ship in civ V. Don't buy this game till the patch comes and or the price drops.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was a sad addition to a great series.Cons--Boring the ai doesn't do anything, I talk trash to them and they don't care-masma is just a chore has no real sway -The tech tree is still linear, you go for the fastest victory, and supplement with spies-Spies are op-Tech tree is simple to complete - able to spawn virtues without much loss of good stats in other virtue fields-city states are useless, unless you want some extra culture - The game is just slow and boringPros--they tried something new- It looks very goodI have played a few games single and multiplayer, and it is just slow and boring, I never felt any threat and just turtled with a few good units and went for fast victory. I played through once and the end game is horrible just walking through whole civs with a few guys, no problem. This game is broken, and needs a patch pronto. 10/27/14			",18,1,0,1,5,0,11

After two hours of gameplay I realized this is just a mod for Civ 5. A 50$ mod for Civ 5. I spend a lot of time on Twitch.tv. Any new interesting game that comes out shows up in the popular streams. Even the broken Sim City was high up on Twitch.tv for weeks. I have never seen this one. It just isn't new or even fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I do not like writing reviews that are negative, But I feel that this has to be written. Civilization: Beyond Earth is rediculios. Unless I build a masssive army I cannot stand against the aliens even on the lowest level . I have tried playing several different organizations using harmony and when I try to even get close to an alien nest i am swarmed by more than 6 aleins and killed before I can do anything . If I attack them then The swarm my cities and I die. this is not a challenge this is a farce. Current dilemma is that and artifact has been found next to an alien nest and resource has also been found next to an alien nest I have lost 6 military units attempting to recover theses items and yet none of the aliens have even died. In my opinion I have wasted $60 dollars on a game that I thought would challenging and fun not frustrating and rediculous.			",24,6,0,8,3,0,16

												This is easily the weakest Civ in modern memory. It would have made an excellent mod for Civ V, but is absolutely not worth paying the full price for. If you are a massive Civ fan, it might be a good purchase but Civ V still remains a stronger game in every single measurable aspect.Presumably, until the first DLC release there are only eight playable civs. However, it does not make a difference as the civs do NOT have unique units. Instead, what units you can build depends on your 'affinity'. As you level up through the enormously complex tech tree, you will gain points towards one of three affinity trees depending on what skills you train- Harmony, Purity or Supremacy. Essentially this means that there are actually only an absolutely pathetic three sets of units possible to build. Wait until the Christmas specials for this one, folks. ",151,41,4,20,42,3,36

												I'm only downvoting this because I feel this game needs a 50% rating. Really, it's not a bad game. If you like the 4X genre, it's very well done. Pros:Graphics are well doneTech Tree is unique and well made. (If not a little confusing)Overall Gameplay is engaging, if not a little repetitive.Affinity trees finally have been paid attention to, and are moving in the right directionThe engine runs very smoothly. Even on Huge maps my slightly above mediocre computer runs it smoothly, with minimal load times for textures.Cons:AI is blah.Diplomacy is not only utterly confusing, but also very 1 dimensional.The range on units feels off. How can a guy on foot travel half the distance in a year as a boat can? Really, beating it once or twice is all you can really do. Civ as a whole suffers from End Game goals. At this point, I'd just wait for Civ 6. But if it's on sale, I'd pay maybe 20 bucks for the base game and the DLC. (You definitely need the DLC for this one)			",15,5,0,10,0,0,7

												The game still possess that mojo or whatever to make you wanna play yet another turn over and over, and in the next moment you realize it's 7 AM and you have to go to work. That's a huge plus.BUT, as a person who played and enjoyed Alpha Centauri I am deeply disappointed with this watered down version.  Diplomacy is practically non existent, some aspects of the game which are present in newer Civ games are cut out, probably waiting for yet another money grabbing DLC. Creating your own units is probably something very abstract for mainstream games nowadays.Buy the game, but only when the price drops below 10$.			",1751,632,70,225,227,26,333

												It's totally proper to say that Beyond Earth is an imbalanced game. Some aspects of it is just simple and even silly. It needs a crucial upgrade to revise its systems, especially the trade routes. Moreover, you actually have only 3 ways to win since your affinity is the subsidiary of the alien resources near your capital city and you might not choose the affinity you like if you want to win the game. The positive thing is that the icons and buttons in Beyond Earth are flat and you could control your troops easily and accurately with your fingers touching the screen of your Ultrabooks.

												Game is nice, looking good, and gives a lot of fun to play, but there's a lot of stuff that makes this game not worth to buy:1. This game looks like Civ5 graphics mod, cause nearly no new mechanics was added.2. All ""uniqe"" options that are here, Ive already seen in Civ5 or Pandora:First Contact.3. ""Prepare your ship, and choose what you will take on Your journey"" is actually choosing couple of benefits that were connected to nations in Civ5 (+2 food from cities or +2 culture from cities, free worker or free soldier etc).4. First game Ive made was on marathon speed and took me like 5 hours to finish it, and i havent even build a single combat unit. On fast speed You wont even reach your enemy with your army, and You will already be winning by tech victory.5. Theres only like 8-9 types of units in game, that can be upgraded (by a doctrine - no cash or comming back to your territory required).Conclusion:This game is not worth its price - it should be Civ5 DLC for like 10-15 euros max. Instead its standalone game that costs 50 euros, and it can be clearly see that it has only basic content which will be expanded very soon buy a lot of expensive DLC's. This game can be clearly named cashgrab. Playe Pandora: First Contact with no nukes mod instead. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Drop onto planet, get ur bugfree fences up. And you have defeated the entire planet. Games end by turn 200ish or earlier to affinity victories. Too fast for Aegis Purity unit to be even used. More worse, lately, random maps has been giving me bugfree starts with no nests around even when I been searching for them for 200+ turns with latest patch up. So I don't even have to build the bugfree fences at all!If I could get rid of the game from my library, CivBE is it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm very early in the game,   But so far this is the least engaging Civilization game.  It is, at best, an expansion pack on Civ 5. They combined efforts to streamline the game (which removes the Civilization early-game, effectively) and make it alien (so the tech tree takes more time to understand).  Together these make it so that you don't get engaged quickly and the game will take a lot of effort to really understand.  Effort that it isn't clearly deserving of.			",222,34,5,35,34,2,43

												Just terrible, the game is nearly unplayable in a literal sense. Any online play takes several tries to get off the ground because the game crashes constantly in multiplayer, although it is admittedly better in LAN play than over the internet.  It tends to be a toss-up whether or not the racial faction bonuses will work at any given time. The mechanics are unimaginative, with a completely uninspired tech-bubble that lets you decide exactly the way you wish your civilization to be the same as everyone else's because the techs are scattered all over the place and full of requirements from other techs placed far away on the tree. In the year 2014 there's apparently no way to make an algorithm that even attempts to balance starting conditions. In effect, it's pretty much the exact same deal as with civilization 5, although the tech bubble is less intuitive and harder to construct a proper build out of.Barbarians, one of the most annoying and random features of civilization 5, has been given a steroid treatment so that the game can rocket into the dull trope of all alien worlds somehow inexplicably playing host to naturally bullet-resistant life-forms. Rather than being an interesting event and object of interaction with the world, the aliens pour out of nests, meaning that depending on your location they will either be an insignificant nuisance that you don't really need to take a stance on or absolutely obliterate any chance of staying competitive with anyone who was placed elsewhere on the map. Their aggression is mostly tied into the nests - if you are surrounded by them then too bad, if not then you might not even need to escort your workers and colonists to new locations. This is unmitigated by the techs for dealing with them, due to their being placed on high tiers and randomly around the tech bubble.You're not alone in dealing with the alien threat, however. Every now and then an unafiliated outpost will land somewhere in your expansion circle, forcing you to go to war with them or 35 turns before they go away. Sometimes two outposts disagree about which one of them is going to ruin your day, and make you decide - never give you the option to tell them both to screw off. This happens at random times throughout the game, and you have no control over it. These are the exact two random events that will happen - outposts taking your spot, and aliens taking your spot. Other players may also take your spot, but that's to be expected as you can also take theirs, being that they don't fall from the sky without warning.This game is lazy at best, more of a late beta than a full release in most of the ways that matter. If you preordered, but are intending to play with friends who did not, you can't use the bonus map types - which is pretty stupid, but the blow is softened by the fact that the new map types are basically small variations on the old ones. In their botched attempt to basically recreate Alpha Centauri, Firaxis has managed to leave out most of the interesting parts of this predecessor - the tech bubble is bad, there is no lore to speak of, the factions are bland, even the quotes are terrible - and mashed it with the worst parts of Civilization 5's engine. Just awful.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This is running on the civ5 engine so it does not look next gen but it looks good.-The aliens are great. There are quite a few varieties and they pose a good beginning game challenge.-The tech tree is cool. There is a lot of customizablity.-the affinity system is good but could be more extensive. Most ways to get affinity points are passive (research this tech or choose a quest) but it is a nice addition that I'm sure will be enhanced in DLCCons:-There are not very many different units types. There are no civ specific units, and there are very few types. -This game is obviously built around DLC, there is a lot that should be here (more than just 8 civs) that have been left out-The few civs each feel identical and have almost no differences. At least the civ5 rulers were actual people.-There are not very many victory types. There is domination, first contact, and one affinity specific vixtory open to you. No culture, monetary or science victory can be won.-The AI is unpredictable. They attack without pretext and are almost the same as in Civ5.All in all, this game is not bad. I just find it hard to recommend this for 50 dollars. If it is on sale then I think it is worth it.Score: 6.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Is bad game. I regret dropping fifty dollars. Bugs is total snoozefest.All the reviews of bugs murdering you if you murder them recklessly is a total lie. Drop onto planet, get ur bugfree fences up. And you have defeated the entire planet. Games end by turn 200ish or earlier to affinity victories. Too fast for Aegis Purity unit to be even used. More worse, lately, random maps has been giving me bugfree starts with no nests around even when I been searching for them for 200+ turns with latest patch up. So I don't even have to build the bugfree fences at all!If I could get rid of the game from my library, CivBE is it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												1) Although Firaxis is charging a full price this isn't a full price game but essentially just a Civ-V mod.2) Welcome back to Civ-III micro-management. Having a dozen workers switching between two improvements over 100+ turns instead of assuring a basic road network is not the exception but the rule.3) Be sure to have a working internet connection since the Civilopedia lacks the most important informations. E.g. is there no list of all unit types but a nice article^W paragraph about ""unit types"".4) Victory around Turn 300 is not the exception but again the rule. Favouring the contact victory.5) The AI is either crap or will overrun you at turn 50.6) Dont expect a revenge of the planet like with the locuts of chiron in SMAC. This is Civilization, stupid.

												Once you're able to translate the new ""tech/space"" speak into Civ V terms, you realize you already know how to play and beat this game.There is really no difference between the three affinities other than the skin of their units. The tech web is an interesting idea on paper but in practice the web takes the exciting tech race and throws it out the window. No improvements to the AI. Also, if you ignore the Aliens then they'll ignore you right back... and that is it the Aliens are out of the game. The outposts which were city-states in civ v are dumbed down so that you can only send trade routes to them. The orbital layer is underwhelming to say the least. And the favors system in diplomacy is useless.The good news is that it is a very very pretty reskin of CIV and the good Civ V game play dynamics are still there. Additionally, Multiplayer is pretty good.My Advice: Wait for either good mod or a great dlc to improve this game. Until then it is unfortunate that I cannot recommend this game.*Just like everyone else I am a long time Civilization Fan.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My advice would be : wait untill they released all the xpansions and sell it as a package. But 50 euro + 2-3 expansions at full price is NOT worth it.That's my criticism basically : price/quality does not match anymore. You will have read all the pro's and con's from other reviewers. And its Civ's pattern of the last 10 years : bring out a non-finished vanilla game, sell it for full price, ignore the criticisms cos by the time you bring out a redeeming expansion (for full price of course) everyone will have forgotten.

												I was expecting a great game like Civ V, but revamped. All I see is a reskin, and a very poor one at that. You just dont feel acomplished even when you have the best runthrough you can. Rather than getting new units, all you do is upgrade existing ones, while this is ok, again, it doesnt feel acomplishing when you upgrade them. Before the new unit would replace the existing one (like replacing longswordsman with Minutemen, or Tanks with Death Machines), why they couldnt impliment that is beyond me. Also, rather than working towards the end of the tech tree to win, now theres a cluster F*** of a tech tree that will make new players heads spin. Another problem, the map itself. You see that ""Floatstone"" or ""Fireaxite"", well dont bother with it for half the game, because thats when your able to even harvest it. WHATS THE POINT OF HAVING REVEALED RESOURCES THAT YOU CANT DO ANYTHING WITH? What happened to Revealing it on the map at the point of when you need it. Best example of doing it right, Civ 5. In Civ 5, you reveal almost every strategic resource when you progress the tech tree. Here, most of it is shown you you outright. Not all, but most. Also, there doesnt seem to be alot of resources in total, and most dont have the same effect it did in Civ 5. Happyness, i mean ""Health"" is not controlled anymore by the resources you have, which makes it very difficult to keep the ""empire"" ""healthy"". Probably the worst part though, the part that really pisses me off, are the victories. I beat the game doing the promised land victory. Heres what you do, you launch the tellalink satalite and then you can get the Exodus Gate. Once you build that, you think the ending is right there right? WRONG? NOW, you have to teleport 20 earth settlers to settle on the planet, and they cant settle within 3 tiles of eachother or cities. This game ending is so ♥♥♥♥ed up its unbelievable, and to top it off, theres a glitch in the game where it wont give me the achievment for it. These are just some facts and my oen opinions on the game. I think they should have exapnded Civ 5 firther rather than give us this game, here here we are. This game is unfinished and unpolished in terms of gameplay and the victories are just ♥♥♥♥ing horrid. Avoid this game until proper DLC content make this game hopefully as complete it made Civ 5.P.S. I also forgot to mention that a bunch of animations either seem to be missing from the game or just not there. When I was attacking enemies, i didnt see anything that looked like they were getting shot it. What it looks like is the gun flashing w/ sound effects but no visuals of them getting shot, just them dieing. Best example, using the Rocket vehicles. I dont see any rockets fireing, just the red sparks of wat i believe to be them them coming from the end barrels.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												 Let me start off by saying that I have over 2k hours in civ 5 which started out rough but got much better with expansions. Well this game needs expansions bad because it feels like it is still in beta, there is poor unit diversity and the maps feel like civ 5 maps with new skins. In many ways this feels like a dumbed down version of civ 5 with out some features. I do like the new tech web, it gives you many more options in early research and i really like the unit upgrade system but besides those few features there is alot left to be desired.  I would wait for the first DLC or expansion before buying this game, it feels unfinished.			",59,8,2,11,12,0,16

												Played a massive map game with 8 factions that lasted around 21 hours. And lost due to the new purity exodus victory type meaning I could not select the just one more turn option. 10/10 Probably more like a 7.5/10 as it isn't as full as Civ 5 and most of the factions seem to play much the same as each other. The new affinities, unit upgrades and things that replaced ideaologies are quite fun and definately more influencial on gameplay. The load times seem a bit longer than necessary but it doesn't take an enormous amount of time. Graphics are fairly similar to Civ 5. The map generation seems a bit uniform across the map as I think I just got Tundra and desert which lead to a fairly brown game.If you want to wait for some expansions to flesh it out or the game to go on sale then have a look at Pandora: First Contact. As it is fairly similar and costs £22.99 at the moment.If you enjoyed Civ games and or sci-fi strategy you will probably enjoy this. I would definately recommend getting it when it is on sale if you are on the fence.			",102,19,1,42,15,4,32

												This simply isn't a ""full game"". Much like Borderlands: The PreSequel - it's a full price game without the content to justify the price.The AI is weak, the units are worse than ever before - the interesting veterancy system has been stripped away and replaced with affinity choice that affect all current and future units. All you can choose when you units lvl up is instant heal or more damge.The factions are confusing and due to weak voice acting lack personality. There are overwhelming balance issues which allow you to trvialize the game if you are willing to spam health buildings/improvments, found after city to create internal trade routes and send out spies to steal energy from everyone you can. There are essentially no downsides to this play style.Online play is also unstable and prone to crashes.The game also feels like it was made on a very small budget with lots of cut corners. There is very limited voice acting, there are no movies for wonder, no ending cinematics, no faction specific events or anything that would make the game interesting.  In short - this game is an uninspired unpolished cash grab.Just buy Pandora First Contact for $35 - it's a more interesting game at this point.			",261,40,13,54,38,0,63

												This game is unfinished, it lacks the diversity of units, of technologies, of gameplay overall. The game has too few interactions between the players, in between with the outposts, and in between with the aliens. Long gone are the days of ""barbarian"" defending, exploration of world wonders, and having to form and manage alliances, luxury resource trades; not to mention the happiness' replacement health statistic just does not appear to work properly. Beyond Earth relies too much on the modding community to improve the gaming experience, as well as certain DLCs that are planned pre-release. This is not okay and if I could sell this game back, I would; and just go play Civilization V instead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's basically Civ5 with a fancy tech tree; ideologies that are researchable and make a difference from the beginning (and affect unit upgrades); crazy-powerful barbarian aliens; 'miasma' terrain effect (handy!); and no religion too.If you liked Civ5, you'll probably have fun. If not, this is basically more of the same and you should probably steer clear.PS:- Hint: Dump miasma satellites on enemy cities if they aren't using Harmony. Pour miasma on everything, and watch them take damage from standing in the bad stuff every turn as they approach your cities. Get the upgrade that heals your units for standing in miasma, and pour it on YOUR terrian for super combat advantages. PPS:- Miasma.			",442,146,7,68,44,2,65

All I can say is that for a game aiming to be the spiritual succesor to Alpha Centauri they completely missed the point. All I can hope for is some really good DLC to fix this broken game.

												I almost didn't buy BE after reading so many reviews damning it all the way Hades. But I'm a big fan of Sid Meier and went ahead and purchased.  At first I could totally relate to all the negative comments. It really did seem like Civ 5 had been reskinned and renamed, but without the good stuff. What I discovered after sticking with it awhile, determined to get my money's worth:- This is not Civ 5, therefore you cannot play with exact same strategy as Civ 5. Similar, but different enough you will need to adjust a bit- There is a learning curve. Most overwhelming I found was the Technology Web. Definitely takes a while to wrap your head around what is important and when to research.- Wonders do help ALOT. If you build the right ones. Again, there is a learning curve- Read up on the Affinity's, pick one and go hard - Unless you only want to go to war for a Domination Victory, check out the ingame help, learn about the Victories, pick one and go for itOn the down side:- Trade routes are a nuisance. You always seem to give away more than you receive, but it can help things keep ticking over. You can more or less put them on auto pilot if you want to- Overall the game is a bit bland. In an effort to make it look futuristic all the developers have achieved is making it ""samey"" imho- Lack of variation in the color scheme adds to the sameyness feel of things, it also makes identifying different types of units etc challenging at timesOverall I am greatly enjoying this game. Each time round I discover something new and find a new depth. If you enjoy strategy and are prepared for a learning curve then you will enjoy BE too.			",11,0,1,7,29,0,11

												Civ Beyond Earth is an interesting game. Fans had been wondering when they'd see a spiritual successor to Alpha Centauri for some time, and Beyond Earth takes it into the modern era nicely, very much its own thing but with nice consistencies in lore and in some returning unit types, but apart from that, everything is redesigned from the ground up and is balanced pretty nicely for whatever type of game you're looking to get, from long and epic on huge planets to short, sweet and scrappy with a handful of opponents in close proximity. There's also a plethora of different map types and features to keep you occupied for hundreds of hours if you let it, particularly with the Exoplanets map pack. My favorite is a fixed-orbit planet, with scorching desert on one hemisphere, frozen wasteland in the other, and a sweet spot around the highly-contested equator area. There's a lot of little touches that add a lot of depth and replayability, which I like very much.A lot of people I've asked about it have given it flak for feeling like a mod of Civ 5 they charged full price for, but they're forgetting that Alpha Centauri was just an improvement on the Civ 2 engine, and it was just as unique and brilliant. I don't mind this, and I really feel like you get what you pay for with Firaxis games. Their QA has never been perfect, though. Even this far down the line, there's still graphical glitches and spelling errors remaining deeper into the tech tree. Not as many as there used to be, and I recommend just a little bit more power than Steam's recommended settings if you're looking to buy the right hardware to max out the graphics in this game.I am torn between recommending the expansion at this point or not. It adds a LOT to the game and distances itself further from what could honestly be called ""just a Civ 5 mod."" The gameplay is expanded into the ocean, with enhanced graphics for undersea tiles a welcome feast for the eye, with all-new tile enhancements and coastal graphics. Sea bases are finally a thing again, and the way they acquire territory and contribute to Culture is interesting. In other ways, though, it makes the game feel less complete and cluttered. I dunno why you can't zoom out in the tech web anymore, but the redesign with added color coding is at least very nice. The hybrid affinities are great, but at this point I feel like they're accomodating multi-class play styles a little TOO much. You can basically just blindly whisk through the tech web, researching whatever, and at any point you'll be pretty well-equipped with good options for any situation. I don't know whether to call it an improvement or a lack of focus. I've had some good games with it, anyway, and it does seem more effective in the short term at least to focus on one direction, whether it be an endgame plan or a particular affinity or powerful unit you want to go for. I think the clincher for me is how the alien AI behaves differently on different planet types in Rising Tide. It's such a small touch, but one that adds infinite variety, which is important in games that have a randomized element.In the end, if you like Civ, definitely get this game, and if you want a truly unique and rich experience, get the expansion too, but with that, it feels like they focused on some areas more than others, and like they might be gearing up for a second expansion at some point, like with Civ 5. In particular I hope for them to focus on the combat AI a bit more. It's a little too easy to steamroll them on the battlefield, even an expansion down the line. Word of advice: Even if you're just starting out with the game, play it on at least Gemini, because it is way less challenging than some Civ games.			",95,19,1,15,19,2,29

The best part of the game is the intro video, probably because they didn´t even bother to make one for completing the game.I´ll be back in 2 years, CIV V vanilla was bad aswell, and it´s not like they don´t know how to make a good game, they just want to sell it in parts.

Missing the FunYou just don't have the fun in this game.2. Tech WebVery boring, very slow. Just a mind map.3. MiasmaIt does not make the game fun. It actually slows things down as your exploration is hampered by -10 life.4. Nothing uniqueEvery race is the same.5. AffinitiesRevolves around the Miasma. Why? What does your affinity have to do with Miasma immunity? Harmony, Purity, Supremacy. Doesn't really make a lot of sense.Specialization resources? You land, you find Xenomass(Harmoney)/Floatstone(Purity)/Firaxite(Supremacy), you beeline to using that particular resource. WTF? Just a replacement for Horses?6. Build Expeditions (limited by Expedition Module)They are randomly generated as you explore. They give good benefits but they are so slow. You have to move a Explorer onto the Progenitor Ruin, then build a expedition and you are limited by the number of modules.Not to mention aliens and Miasma. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I've had some good games with it, anyway, and it does seem more effective in the short term at least to focus on one direction, whether it be an endgame plan or a particular affinity or powerful unit you want to go for. I think the clincher for me is how the alien AI behaves differently on different planet types in Rising Tide. It's such a small touch, but one that adds infinite variety, which is important in games that have a randomized element.In the end, if you like Civ, definitely get this game, and if you want a truly unique and rich experience, get the expansion too, but with that, it feels like they focused on some areas more than others, and like they might be gearing up for a second expansion at some point, like with Civ 5. In particular I hope for them to focus on the combat AI a bit more. It's a little too easy to steamroll them on the battlefield, even an expansion down the line. Word of advice: Even if you're just starting out with the game, play it on at least Gemini, because it is way less challenging than some Civ games.			",95,19,1,15,19,2,29

												Hmm...i have mixed Feelings about this Game.First i was amazed by the new Hud, Fractions, Units, by the new research System... but now after about 50 hours its already boring and im happy when im done with my Achievements to uninstall the Game.Pro and Contra	 + New Fractions, Units, Hud, Techtree/Researchsystem + The Graphics and Animations are a little better than at Civilization V. + Nice sounds and good ambient Music.+ Steam Workshop Support+ The Multiplayermode seems to work fine, but take this with caution, only played 2 Matches.+ Running smooth and didnt crash a single Time in 50 Hours.- The AI is terrible. Sometimes unable to build Units, just bulding Cities and even more Cities, not gathering ressources. At other times they attack you out of the blue, for no reason.And this happens like a gamble, totally random and can happen on every difficulty. Often all the AI does is a) nothing besides spamming Cities or b) Steamrolling you with a an Army that contains mostly just one Unit type. If you play with AI vs AI, your AI is mostly nothing more than a victim. On higher difficulty they just get rushed without resistance. For fun i tried several settings like 2v1, 3vs1, 2vs2  and even 6 AI + Me ( playing defensive) vs ONE Enemy AI, and guess who won? the Enemy rushed one unable Teammate after another. Also hilarious, when the AI ends up with a cashflow of MINUS 7000 per turn, like this- If youre not familar with Civilization IV or V, its hard to find into the Game, the Settings, Hud, and Overview are very confusing.-  Wonders and Quests have an insufficient  or confusing Descriptions. Also some Quests are bugged in case that they wont be completed, even if you did all required tasks, and sometimes they just repeat themselves over and over again. - No Match Statistics after the Game. I loved to see a Gameoverview at CiV 5, but here it seems to be missing. All together Beyond Earth has some nice new Changes, but also a lot of Civilization V in it.Thats not bad, but considering the high Price, Broken AI, confusing Descriptions&Menus and that the lack in variety makes the Game boring after ""only"" 50 Hours, its a tough decision. Currently I would say that you better install and try the DEMO before you buy it!  ( You can find it on the right side of the Game's Storepage )   To be fair, there is hope that it will be patched soon and even with its flaws it kept me entertained for 50 Hours, so it gets a ""YES"" from me, but please dont expect it to be Fun for hundreds of Hours, like former CIV Titles, because it just isnt.

												As a regular gamer from CiV Games this one was probebly the one I looked forward too. and for some reason it dissapointed me a lot. Ill go with the pro's and con's Pro'sNice graphicsNice audio Okey-ish story (ffor what you can put into the story) Gameplay looked good to me New models are quite cool con's The info tips confused me more Wonders don't add anything (close to nothing) Victory quests are quite dissapointing The thing is. I wanted a lot more of beyond earth. If you see Civ 5 In all its glory I think it is a dissapointement. Just because of the fact that not a lot matter anymore. you dont have relegion, you dont have wonders and their story. Well you do have wonders but they dont add so much on it anymore wich is quite the shame. So in the end I would not recommend this game but I would say : Get CiV 5 It is a lot better explained if you are new. the story is a lot better (wonders and how it works) And it makes more sense.

												I don't mean to rehash other reviews, so I'll try to be short:I'm running it on max settings with a good, large monitor, btw and still:* Hard to distinguish what's on each tile.* Unlike Civ V, many resources and technologies have unfamiliar names. There's very little intuitive about what you're getting by researching or building certain things. Especially since sometimes the bonuses aren't fully explained or apply to other new or renamed concepts.* Tech tree pretends to be less linear, but it's not. The exponential tech required for each subsequent trie means that you still end up going in a more n-level preferential pattern. I tried digging deep initially and paid for it.* Maybe my game was bugged or I did something wrong, but I was constantly surrounded with 2+ Krakens and 2+ siege worms at all times. For reference, since that doesn't mean anything if you haven't played, these are alien monsters that one-hit the majority of units in the game. They take about 5 turns to kill from a distance with mid-game units. I was unable to expand due to the siege worms and being surrounded by ""miasma,"" which damages and hinders units on tiles with miasma. While I'm aware there are techs to get rid of it, the rest of the AI didn't seem to have the same problem.* I kept wishing I was playing Civ V, or something that more closely resembled it, actually--even the base game without the DLC's. They should have used more familiar concepts with regard to resources, technologies, and buildings.* While they could be an interesting game mechanic, the constant quest popups get old quickly.On a positive note, I really liked how intra-civilization trade was a viable option in this game, with included techs and culture (or whatever) options to boost that option; most especially because I was surrounded by aliens that would blockade my trade routes otherwise.Maybe with updates and DLC this game will be better but honestly I think there's a fundamental problem with the art design and the general naming conventions etc. that would stop me from playing--again for context, this is coming from someone who loves scifi novels and has an engineering BS and is a year away from an MD, it's not like I'm unfamiliar with the pseudo-scientific terms they were trying to use.Last, sorry I know I didn't keep this short, I found the interface overall more difficult to use than Civ V. They repositioned many of the old menus, and there's no longer the top-left drop down menu with the most important views (units, tech, etc.)--I made significant use of that panel in Civ V and its exclusion was frustrating. WRT menus, the art design used a very monochromatic theme with poor visual differentiation. Hard to read.			",69,7,4,11,9,0,9

												It's little more than Civ 5 with a skin, updated espionage, numerous bugs and a less polished feel.  The art budget has clearly taken a nose dive and it leaves you with the feeling that they gave up developing it half way through and just threw some stuff together to get it finished and out of the door.  Everything about the game leaves you feeling meh and it makes you wonder if Firaxis are trying to flog a dead horse rather than come up with something new and innovative.  Fully expect plenty of expensive add-ons which bring little more to the game than the army of modders out there could achieve.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sid Meier's Civilization has been one of my favorite PC series since I first laid hands on Civilization II. With the more recent release of Civilization V, my love for the franchise was rekindled; the revamped, addictive gameplay model was remarkably difficult to put down. When Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth was announced, I figured developer Firaxis would keep the trend going. Thankfully, that's definitely the case.Beyond Earth, as its name implies, is a sci-fi-tinged take on the Civilization formula. On different alien planets, you establish an outpost that becomes a full-fledged city. The names of the planets matters little; instead, each planet represents different map layouts. Some feature multiple land masses and smaller bodies of water separating the land, while others may have an extremely large land mass surrounded by ocean. There's a decent variety to choose from, along with more advanced types that feature tougher climates and layouts than the standard set. You can also dictate the overall size of the map, allowing for two, four, six, or eight different sponsors on any map.As you might suspect, a sponsor is essentially a nation or faction controlled by you, another player, or the AI. Beyond Earth features a total of eight sponsors. If you're willing to delve into the optional Civilopedia, you get a lot more information on the background of each sponsor and how each relates to real-world cultures. Each sponsor also has a distinct attribute.There are even more options at your disposal when beginning a new single-player game. Aside from picking the size/type of map and sponsor, you also choose a colonist type. You can also choose your spacecraft, which grants additional bonuses, like the ability to see all coasts or see all alien nests on the map despite the standard ""fog"" that needs to be lifted via exploring units. Finally, you can choose what cargo to bring on your journey, essentially providing another bonus.Having all of these starting options and choices helps to make each single-player game feel unique, regardless of how many times you play the game. The options aren't uncommon for the Civilization series, but I enjoyed the sci-fi spin. Every bonus or ability provided by cargo, spacecraft, colonists, etc., helps you mold the game to your play style. Any game can be won in a number of ways, so you're pretty much free to explore the victory condition that you'd prefer.Most victory conditions are spread across three different affinities that you can explore: Harmony, Purity and Supremacy. You either choose to live in peace with all forms of life on the planet, wipe out alien species or dominate opposing sponsors. You can devote time to all three affinities or focus on just one. Each affinity ""levels up"" as you gain points by completing branches of the Tech Web. This in turn provides you with new technology, units and buildings to further enhance your cities and sponsor.Leveling up your affinities provides special bonuses, often to military, land and sea units once you hit certain milestones. The different affinity bonuses do a solid job of complementing their intended path, but some of the military-focused upgrades get a little generic and repetitive.While the Tech Web is chock-full of various technologies to explore, it's a bit clunky and difficult to navigate. The biggest issue I had was pinpointing the natural progression of the affinity on which I was focusing. It doesn't feel as organized as it should, and for a new player, it is absolutely overwhelming. While Civilization V focused much of its early game on battling against barbarian hordes in order to gain footholds and experience for starting cities and units, Beyond Earth has a slightly slower pace. Barbarians are replaced by alien bugs, which are generally peaceful unless you attack first or get too close to their nests. Instead, many of your early turns in Beyond Earth are going to be focused on exploring. As you roam the map, moving from one hexagonal tile to the next, you'll luck into resource pods, which can provide quick boosts to base resources like energy and science.Once you've mapped out a sizeable portion of the area and have likely run into rival sponsors, you'll want to begin expansion by designating new outposts. Once an outpost is established, it slowly grows as long as it remains healthy. Health essentially replaces the happiness stat of other Civilization titles, but maintaining it doesn't feel nearly as problematic as it did in Civilization V.As cities expand, they occupy more of the surrounding tiles. These tiles can be modified by worker units, which enhance or mine the natural resources. As in other Civilization titles, you can automate a lot of unit functions, but you'll likely want to be hands-on with most of them. Unit speeds are pretty quick, so most turns pass quickly.The only real issue I've had with Beyond Earth is that the opposing AI is remarkably docile. On various difficulty settings, I've had to really work hard to trigger any sort of diplomatic incident. When you encounter new sponsors, they're generally jovial enough to immediately engage in a dialogue with you. You often receive notices to open borders or establish trade.While perfectly playable via local means, with both LAN support and single-machine ""pass the mouse"" modes, Beyond Earth also hosts online multiplayer. There don't seem to be many players still using it, as I'd only run into one or two hosted rooms at any time of the day.Passive AI and lackluster online support from the community isn't enough to make Civilization: Beyond Earth a total wash. If you've enjoyed the series over the years, you'll likely spend many hours with this entry as well. It deviates just enough from the excellent Civilization V to be a worthwhile experience, and it offers a different pace than its predecessor, so even though it's not a significant upgrade, it's still pretty remarkable.

												Having not been a gigantic in-depth Civ player in the past I'm not too sure what the hate toward this game is. It does seem more dumbed down than Civ5 but Civ5 was more dumbed down than 3 and 4, and thats just a trend games see to be unfortunately following these days (Fallout 3 to 4, Elder Scrolls 3 to 4 to 5, even the new Star Wars Battlefront is ridiculously basic).But as far as a space strategy game goes, this is a decent basic one that can still steal away lots of time. If you'd rather spend your time on some grand space game you might want a true 4X one, but if you want Civ with aliens and astronauts then Beyond Earth is, truly, a lot of fun.

												Until Rising Tide is released, I simply cannot recommend this game. It's been out for around a year now, and only then did Firaxis realize what was wrong. They released it in an incomplete, unbalanced, unforgiving condition. I'd lovingly pay to actually have the complete version of this game, and I already have. But for now, let's outline some details.-The diplomacy of the base game is absolutely halfassed, and the AI's are way too predictable.- Affinities are a fantastic addition to the civ formula, but it seems like the Harmony affinity trumps all every single time. Thus surfacing some serious power balancing issues.-The miasma. Who's idea was this.... it makes the difficulty so artificial it's crazy.-The amount of tile improvements you can build gets extremely overwhelming. It would have been better to just upgrade each existing one and and a few new ones, rather than have a new one for every other technology on the absolutely massive tech tree.To sum up my thoughts on beyond earth, wait until rising tide comes out.EDIT: This NEGATIVE REVIEW is for the standalone base game. If you want a fantastic Civ experience, then play this game with the Rising Tide expansion.			",188,20,0,19,9,0,21

												Unrefined, cumbersome, broken, yet still seems more fun than Civ 5.  The virtue tree is neat.  The unit upgrading system is fun, yet inconsistent (if you don't select an upgrade because you're looking to take a different upgrade path, your unit will still cost more, but have no benefit from the increased cost).  City managers for automated improvement building are gone.  Just finding the building queue and where to set your specialists is beyond poorly designed.  Actually, the city screen as a whole has taken a huge step backward from Civ 4.  Workers have no command to build a road network of their own, aside from the most basic route-to command.  Dozens of times, I have had to reapply the go-to command to my units.  Practically zero explorable objects on a large map.  Trade routes become quite annoying as your empire grows, as you have to re-apply the trade routes every 30 turns.Oh, and the game is occasionally unwinnable.  The game bugged out when we dominated the opponent.  Team 2 was removed, but no victory was given.  We even went and finished a second victory condition, but that simply made my game crash.  I was unable to rejoin the game, as it won't allow you to join a game where there is only one team.			",318,58,4,42,29,6,59

												As a huge fan of Alpha Centauri, I was longing for this game, hoping it would recapture that magic and bring it back to us with updated graphics and an UI that didn't suck.In short: It doesn't.The general atmosphere does a decent job at imitating SMAC: SciFi Setting, fictional tech quotes, aliens, and so on. Beyond Earth even goes - well - beyond Civ 5 by adding the orbital layer, covert ops, quests, excavations and the affinity system.Unfortunately (based on my limited trial run) the affinity system feels like a slog and doesn't even come close to replacing the custom unit system of it's inspiration. The rest of the disappointment can be filed under the one thing that Beyond Earth absolutely nailed from Alpha Centauri: The terrible UI. Obviously 15 years are not enough to fix that. The trade route system is annoying busywork, the help system is even worse that in SMAC but the most brain-dead design decision must have been to blur out the most essential stats every time you enter a management window.Firaxis could salvage this game with nothing but some UI-teaks (coincidentally exactly the same thing that SMAC would have required for a re-release). But as it stands now this is a waste of enormous potential.			",126,30,1,25,21,1,30

												Many aspects are streamlined to the point of being joyless, making room for hundreds of uninteresting, unimportant ""moral choices"" to occupy you while you aren't clicking on trade routes over and over.While offering you zillions of meaningless choices, it typically removes the most significant one. The affinity system claims to give you an important choice to shape your nation, but it only works when you have access to the correct magic rocks, so you actually need to pick whichever one fits which magic rocks are available to you.Stylistically, it's pretty bland. You are Some Guys who are on A Generic Planet. Does the planet have a name? I don't know. It's just enough like Alpha Centauri to make you wish you were playing Alpha Centauri.

												While the game is fun to play hundreds of turns one after another. There is a few issues that could make anyones gaming experience a nightmare. My laptop operates on Windows 8, which as you may know loves to update all the time and when ever it feels like it. In order to play a game off steam I have to keep my windows 8 up to date. But thats not a horrible thing.  What really sucks is while in-game a message prompts you to decide to help a friend, ignore him/her and etc. The message  requires a decision in order to move on because it is that players turn. While in this prompted message I can click on any button and all the visual and sound effects still work. Except nothing happens. Message stays there, game doesn't do anything (let it sit for an hour to think). The game has a lot of bugs, that were cheaply brought over from the previous games interface. What you get is what you bought, right? I suggest staying away from this game, the $50 is a sunk cost. The game is worth only $25 for the amount of content it brings forth. Overall the gaming experience is long, lacking a good bit of fun and drags out everything. You will be playing for 300-1000 turns probably.Visuals: 4/5 Zooming in further would be nice to look at details, even with the graphics up almost the whole way.Overall: 3/5Lacks content, and fun.

												I have a few complaints.  There are only two victory types, your typical domination where you take over cities and then a science victory. There might be quite a few science victories but it’s all a tech race. The civ you pick has very very little meaning the only choice that matters is your affinity leading to their only really being three civ types on the map. I feel like this makes the game supper boring. The complete lack of unit types in the game is also very off putting. There are no bombers, subs, anti-tank units, anti-air units or missiles of any kind. They completely removed the united nations concept as well. All in all this is just a reskinned and less deep version of civ 5. If you like civ 5 just keep playing it until they put out the inevitable $20 dlc to give us the full game. ",37,4,0,20,18,0,37

												Updated Review:The game has a lot to live up to. Civ 5 Was released in 2010 and is still a game I can say that I still love to play 4 years later, which is a pretty impressive feat. It is also the 3rd most-downloaded game on Steam after TF2 and Dota 2. Unfortunately for me, Beyond Earth just can't live up to its predecessors. At this stage, we've all been so spoiled with just how amazing Civ 5 is that it ends up being boring for most of us. I think there's more to it, and i'll elaborate below. Here's a quick pros & cons list:Pros:Graphics are good and appropriateOpening cinematic is greatMusic is interestingTrade Routes have been improvedWorkshop is availableDecent capturing of an Alien landscapeGame is Balanced Orbital level is coolCons:Gameplay is boringVictory types are confusingTech Web has no real sense of direction Affinities don't add to gameplayQuests are randomUnit selection is supremely limited (no AA, no submarines, no missiles)8 Civilizations... (we have WAAAAAY more in Civ 5)Storyline is nonexistent (aside from an amazing opening cinematic)Game is too balancedNaval Combat is dumbGame is overall a boreFor me, I've gone through two playthroughs of this game. Honestly after that, I can't really find a good reason to go through and do it again. The game is okay, but compared to what was available with the first iteration of Civ 5 (which changed almost everything) This game, despite not being a DLC (which would have made more sense to me, this is just what happens after a space victory.) Doesn't feel like it was meant to be a standalone game. All the units, despite their distinct looks, are very obvious reskins of eachother, and really the differences are negligible. Affinities serve no real purpose in-game other than cosmetic appearance, and a few unique units only available to certain affinity levels. The tech web, while it is different, doesn't really add much to the game--and it's not very well explained as to what your goal is supposed to be with it. The game feels too well balanced. There's no definite reason why you should go with a certain affinity over another depending on your playstyle. As a person who's accustomed to seeing similar skins in RTS games like Wargame and Command & Conquer, there are definite advantages to playing for a particular side/team depending on your playing style. Affinities, are a half-baked attempt to do so. They don't actually add any elements to cater to a particular playing style, and given the lack of unit variety ultimately don't add definitive advantages to  choosing a particular affinity over another--they're ultimately cosmetic.Conclusion: All in all, I did sort of enjoy my two playthroughs of the game. I didn't feel quite like I do when I play Civ 5, and have to cater my strategy to each person. The graphics arent better, nor are they different enough to actually consider it a separate game from Civ 5,  it would have made more sense as just another DLC. There are some improvements to the game over Civ 5, but not enough to justify the high price it's been given.			",18,2,0,1,9,0,21

												Well, I am a enormous fan of Civilization and Alpha Centauri.  That said, I cannot fully endorse this new game.  While its not a bad game, its inherently flawed.  There is no real divergence between victory conditions, almost completly useless city-states, etc.  There is no real reward.  There is no substance.  The factions are all completely bland.  If you didn't like CIV 5, you'll hate this.  If you did, you'll miss the fun of the historical background.  GOG has Alpha Centauri.  Play that.  Better yet, play Pandora right here on Steam.

												Having not been a gigantic in-depth Civ player in the past I'm not too sure what the hate toward this game is. It does seem more dumbed down than Civ5 but Civ5 was more dumbed down than 3 and 4, and thats just a trend games see to be unfortunately following these days (Fallout 3 to 4, Elder Scrolls 3 to 4 to 5, even the new Star Wars Battlefront is ridiculously basic).But as far as a space strategy game goes, this is a decent basic one that can still steal away lots of time. If you'd rather spend your time on some grand space game you might want a true 4X one, but if you want Civ with aliens and astronauts then Beyond Earth is, truly, a lot of fun.

												Unrefined, cumbersome, broken, yet still seems more fun than Civ 5.  The virtue tree is neat.  The unit upgrading system is fun, yet inconsistent (if you don't select an upgrade because you're looking to take a different upgrade path, your unit will still cost more, but have no benefit from the increased cost).  City managers for automated improvement building are gone.  Just finding the building queue and where to set your specialists is beyond poorly designed.  Actually, the city screen as a whole has taken a huge step backward from Civ 4.  Workers have no command to build a road network of their own, aside from the most basic route-to command.  Dozens of times, I have had to reapply the go-to command to my units.  Practically zero explorable objects on a large map.  Trade routes become quite annoying as your empire grows, as you have to re-apply the trade routes every 30 turns.Oh, and the game is occasionally unwinnable.  The game bugged out when we dominated the opponent.  Team 2 was removed, but no victory was given.  We even went and finished a second victory condition, but that simply made my game crash.  I was unable to rejoin the game, as it won't allow you to join a game where there is only one team.			",318,58,4,42,29,6,59

												Until Rising Tide is released, I simply cannot recommend this game. It's been out for around a year now, and only then did Firaxis realize what was wrong. They released it in an incomplete, unbalanced, unforgiving condition. I'd lovingly pay to actually have the complete version of this game, and I already have. But for now, let's outline some details.-The diplomacy of the base game is absolutely halfassed, and the AI's are way too predictable.- Affinities are a fantastic addition to the civ formula, but it seems like the Harmony affinity trumps all every single time. Thus surfacing some serious power balancing issues.-The miasma. Who's idea was this.... it makes the difficulty so artificial it's crazy.-The amount of tile improvements you can build gets extremely overwhelming. It would have been better to just upgrade each existing one and and a few new ones, rather than have a new one for every other technology on the absolutely massive tech tree.To sum up my thoughts on beyond earth, wait until rising tide comes out.EDIT: This NEGATIVE REVIEW is for the standalone base game. If you want a fantastic Civ experience, then play this game with the Rising Tide expansion.			",188,20,0,19,9,0,21

												The most underrated game in the Civ series. BE has a steeper learning curve than the earlier Civ games, but after a few playthroughs, it's really fun. The tech tree is replaced with a tech web that you can traverse in many different ways, and the optimal choices for how to play it are much more map-dependent in this game than previous Civ games (though probably less character dependent, unless you have rising tide). I recommend playing it both with and without the expansion because it's a completely different game. The original game is about coping with scarcity and the expansion is about exploiting abundance. One drawback of the game is that it feels a little too much like a race, at least at the higher difficulty settings because the win-conditions are achievable without exploring all that much of the tech web. It's possible (and even likely) that the strongest/richest/most technologically advanced civilization won't win because you can race to the victory conditions faster by skipping a lot of the improvements to your civ. Internal trade routes are also broken (way too valuable, and even more so in RT where health -- the one thing that checks expansion in BE -- is easier to come by).			",11,1,0,0,7,0,5

												I was excited when I learned about this Civ because it looked awesome on paper, so I preordered it. When I first started playing it, I found it awesome. New ressources, trade routes, aliens, different affinities. My first few games were really fun and I suffered a lot from the ""one last turn"" disease... But then I realize that after 20 hours of gameplay, I pretty much made everything that could be made in the game.. and this is not normal for a Civilization game... I still don't feel that way in Civ5 and I have over 75 hours of gameplay. Things that should have been in Beyond Earth :-Different types of map, not always the same green-blue thing all the time-More factions-ScenariosThings I don't like in the game-The technology tree is pretty confusing and you'll often choose a technology randomly because you have no idea what else to do-Every game I did, I had to press next turn for the last 30 turns without doing anything else, pretty boring...-The simulation for all the A.I. is awfully long, I mean really really long even with a good CPUBeside that it's not a bad game, it feels more like an expansion to Civ5 than anything else... So the 60$ pricetag is not approppriate in my opinion. Buy it if you can have it at less than 30$ or it's not worth it			",192,23,13,17,30,1,41

												It's so copypasted from Civ V that it gets painful. From virtues to dialogue straight up copied from the Civ5, it's kinda even worse.Leaders lack personality, factions are barely different and nothing stops you from upgrading them all. Wonders are bland and with everything being sci-fi, they don't really break out of usual buildings (Spy agency wonder can be constructed by everyone even). Aliens are boring, without enough variety of species and all. And even after all the press, they're still barbarians, except easier.Miasma and overall alien planet seems just like a reskin, and don't get me started on lack of terraforming.It needs a lot of work and i guess you could get it as GOLD edition after all the inevitable DLC packs come out.

They have moved on to Civilization 6 and will never care for this game ever again.This game lacks everything Alpha Centauri was and much much more. Beyond Earth draws alot of parallels with Civilization 5 despite tech tree changes and ocean city building. The only redeeming factor is the alien lifeforms, which shares the same mechanisms as barbarians with a hostile/friendly switch depending on whether you attack them or not. Alpha Centauri does this dynamic much better by incorporating the player's enviromental impact on the planet, with the planet's innate terrestrial lifeforms.The AI in this game plays very defensive and is relatively easy to dominate on the hardest difficulty. Diplomatic power plays well with the different tradable doctrines. However, falls short when it comes to the classic Sid Meirer narrative.This game costed 60$ upon release with the Tidal expansion DLC 30$. Anyone who payed that amount is to this day, disappointed, and very likely never to trust Firaxis' compentency ever again. Including the upcoming Civilization Six. If you buy this game now, know that you are supporting complacency within, the already ever growing pretentiousness of, delusional game creators and artists.			",157,34,1,16,26,2,18

												I got this game out of the Humble Bundle and it ended up in my backlog.  I played through a few maps on Quick, with medium difficulty.  This is a review out of that, coming in March 2016, with a map pack of DLC but not the expansion pack DLC.The ""Not Recommended"" is on this game as the thought that it is a $30 separate release.  You can usually get Civilization 5, Gods and Kings and Brave New World for that on sale.  Spend your money on that.Value:  I normally don't put a value review in my reviews, but this game needs an exception.  It's simply not worth what has been asked of it.  It's a total conversion DLC that was sold as a separate game.  It's not a full game, it's a reskin of the Civ 5 engine that was already 3 years old when this game came to market in 2014.  In 2016, it's simply tired.  It's not worth $30.  It's probably worth $15.  The price should adjust accordingly, because it is tactically stale at this point, and I have less than 30 hours in the Civ 5 franchise (Civ 5, BNW and BE aggregated).Plot and Mechanics: 6/10.  You play a nation of colonists freshly landed on an alien world, who must survive through turn based strategy to a number of varying victories.  Unlike Civ5, the goal here isn't military, it's resource management and city-simulation.  You'll need a military, but it is not the best way to win in my experience on PvAI.  As a result, the games feel overly long, because there are long periods of downtime where you're not doing anything.  The plot is absent.  There's literally nothing. The leaders don't have personalities, the planet doesn't have a history, the aliens are basically background pageantry.  I'm getting angry with how little was realized out of this while writing my review.  Let's move on.Graphics: 8/10.  This game looks amazing, and some of the community mods make it look utterly stunning.  I'm giving half credit to the map texturing to the devs, because the textures were their doing.  The sandy planets, volcanic fissures, oceans, stations, aliens and soldiers all look freaking cool.  I love the motif and the design decisions to differentiate the human colonists based on their colonial decisions rather than their heritages.  With that said, there are so many UI problems and readibility problems on the map that I turned to the community to resolve some of them.  These are easily resolved issues that could have been fixed at any point in the last two years of this game, but it's still really hard to tell which tiles are unhealthy, which units are in a hex and who owns them.  I had to look up online how to access my trade and diplomacy maps because the information isn't adequately presented on one screen (like Civ5's diplo bar).  The information interface is a chore, but the quality here is very good even if the usability and presentation is lacking.Sound: 6/10.  The backing tracks are really enjoyable, and addicting.  I found myself thumping my head along with the ambience music a few times.  The leader vocals are horrible, however, to the point of being an absolute chore to listen to in the game.  I am fairly certain a university acting troupe could outperform this script.  It's dreadful and drags the entire immersion of the game down.   Unit sounds are bloody amazing, however.  The action sounds of Marines, CNDRs and even the Siege worm sound epic and crisp.  It's clear Firaxis put a lot of work into this part of the game and it shows.Gameplay: 7/10.  I'm going to make a few specific ratings, because this review is a comparison setting BNW Civ5 at 10/10.  I'm going to justify to you why this game is seven-tenths as good as Civ5.The Tech Web (Good):  The tech web, which is an utterly unreadable mess of organizational progress, replaces the Tech Tree from Civ 5.  It's a good change.  Yes.  A good change.  The progression is much less linear and it fits the motif of this being a post-human civilization made by humans.  Every game I've had plays really differently, and there aren't the obvious power spikes of Civ 5.  That's a really enjoyable change to the game that was an excellent decision, even if it takes getting used to.Victory Conditions (Bad):  The victory conditions being largely non-military really makes the game lag between turn 100-250.  You might have a military, but it's hard to use it, and you won't want to, owing to the amount that all of the AIs will absolutely hate you.  Most of the AIs do a peaceful route, and I haven't once been attacked in two separate 300 turn games.  That's not Civ, that's Sim City.  So what replaced Domination victories?  There are 5 separate thematic victories that encourage you to do things like terraform the world, or reconnect with Old Earth.  They're thematically cool but really randomly granted.  If anyone ever played the Dune Total Conversion mod for Civ 4, they feel just ripped from that mod.  Once again, it feels like these are DLC add-ons to a Civ5 that should have provided non-military wins to a military game, but instead we got a new environment that places non-military wins in a non-interactive game.Alien AI (Good):  The aliens really behave like a huge powerful faction.  They are neutral towards those that don't bother them and are vicious to those who seek and destroy them.  It's a nice change from Barbarians.Early Game (Disastrous):  There is no early game.  None.  You can't rush anything and swarm an opponent.  It's too had to get good production going and too hard to pressure anyone with how utterly crippling health values are.  The bonuses from Virtues is too strong to not go for early culture, and as a result you wind up with a very insular and passive early game.  This isn't unenjoyable, but it's a disasterous change from Civ 5, because it's just not fun in this game to do these things.  Exploration of the map doesn't feel as tactical as it did in Civ 5.  You're not looking for early military experience to fuel a great person, because you don't get awarded great people.  Wonders are basically non-existent, so there's not really any goals to work toward if you aren't being a warmonger.  It ends up really ruining this game after the first few times you play it.Quests (Mixed):  The idea of quests is super cool.  You have these quests that let you mold your civ after every time you build a new building for the first time.  That's the not-cool part.  Each building has a corresponding quest that will fire the same every single game.  It's repetitive customization.  It would be nice to see more dynamic events that have a mean-time-to-happen implementation instead of triggered events from the construction of buildings.  It doesn't seem like you're really doing anything with these quests, just that they're some form of gameplay for the early game.Replayability; 5/10.  I have no interest in playing this game multiplayer.  It's an unbalanced mess of a game that I imagine would be really really frustrating playing against another human being.  Hell, it's kind of frustrating playing this game against an AI.  The question of building wide vs building tall, building economy vs building military, building culture vs building science ... have all been ruined.  The economy of tiles is a mess in this game, and resource starts and location typically dictate if this game is even playable.  There is no story to complete, and I feel like you can see everything this motif has to offer in maybe 5 games.  While there is some replay added by Affinity specializations, this ultimately falls short of the rich environments and synergistic gameplay that Civ5 offers.Verdict: 5/10.  This is an ultmately forgettable title from a developer that has made some really wonderful and enjoyable games throughout the years.  What's frustrating about Civilization: Beyond Earth is the abundant potential teeming everywhere in the game.  This could have absolutely been an excellent title.  However, any brilliance shown is short-lived.			",107,19,3,18,14,1,32

Short story: for the TL.DR people.Years after you’ve launched your first satellite into space your people have taken to the stars, in search of new hope for humankind among the stars.Game Story:You are one of the leaders send into space to find a habitable planet, in order to do so you are sponsored by a corporation, a cooperative, a union etc. They all have different outlooks into how the world works and so you must choose carefully your sponsors before you set for the stars.Scale:GreatGoodDecentNot badBadNopeGame:Graphic: GoodSound: GoodAnimation: GoodAI: BadGameplay: GoodModding: DecentClarifying the scale:- Graphics are good, of course there is always room for improvement especially since it doesn’t look all the different from previous titles that I’ve reviewed Civilization V. Although that being said it does have this added flavour of Affinity which we will delve a bit more in Gameplay and of course the whole sci-fi feeling to it.- Sound is good, but like previous titles has its hiccups sadly it’s to be expected when the level of change in other aspects it’s not that huge. Of course it’s not to say it’s bad or any of the sort, but it’s good enough that it’s not annoying.- Animations are good, albeit not great, that being said it does bring “new” explosions and somewhat different textures. Some places could’ve used more love than others, of course that can be said even more about the AI and few changes it has to it. Now the feature of changing the clothes of leaders compared to their Affinity was a nice move, which I’ve been waiting for in other previous titles to happen that being said the changes are so minimal you won’t even notice them if you talk with the leaders a lot.- AI sadly is still a mess and will probably will still be a mess, even with the Rising Tide update it didn’t do much in terms of learning the AI. So you will go to war or do peace in the most ridiculous of moments for the most mind boggling reasons.- Gameplay is of course good since at first glance it does look just like a reskin of the previous title, that being said it does add its own small flavours such as being able to control if the trade routes will keep doing the same route or not by ticking it on and off. Affinity which changes not only the look of your troops but also their stats and what they are specialized in, with the Rising Tide update there was a nice change which I was eagerly expecting which was to be able to make hybrids of the Affinity. Albeit not all troops were able to be hybrids, to my sad discovery. Another cool feature was cities on water, which I hoped of before the game came out, which comes with being able to ram units if you are moving the city on that tile.Affinity was a newly added feature that was divided into 3 categories later on having +3 sub categories (for the hybrids) in Rising Tide. Those being Harmony (alien and human DNA), Supremacy (robot and human DNA) and Purity (enhanced human DNA, purely human).- Modding is decent mostly because I haven’t bothered to delve too much into it, from what I can see it does have some mods whether they are good or bad I can’t say for certain so I will remain on decent for now until I do more research if I get time for that.Conclusion: for the TL.DR peopleGame is not bad, but it could’ve been a whole lot better unfortunately I would not recommend buying it for full price, wait for sale and see if you can get Rising Tide in there as well. With that out of the way, if you are looking for a more sci-fi less religion kind of game it’s worth the try. It’s not a bad game but Civilization V isn’t good either without it’s expansions and countless DLC milking. Keep in mind this comes from someone who was looking forward to this game and hoping not to fail completely, kind of did in my honest opinion and I am sad that I spend so much… I would still recommend it but only if you get it on sale! And I do mean sale I don’t mean 10-30% I mean 75% the game had/has potential if they are willing to fix it and do it better. If they decide to pick up the mantle and give it a full overhaul, I might change my outlook on the sale.			",250,33,14,34,34,1,44

												This game fails really hard on almost every new feature its implementing. It is really a shame, because all the ideas behind new mechanics are great and promising, but poorly executed.Affinity system - just another way to track your science progress and it is not about your gameplay style. Also not really suitable for upgrading units as is, could be done SO much better.Espionage system - clearly not tested enough, anything beyond ""steal tech"" is too risky and too hard to execute.Health system - not rewarding/punishing enough, when you are higher than -10, you are totally okay. Also makes Diplomacy nearly useless without luxury resourses.Aliens - great replacement for barbarians, fun to fight with. Also, siege worm is amazing.Virtues system - great.Visual look - great.New science ""tree"" (more like web) - confusing as hell and all the icons are poorly done.Really dissapointing Wonders - too basic and lacks Civ5 unique feel and artwork.Quests system - basic and repetitive, also buggy.New victories - seems kinda cool, but not tied in with gameplay at all. Emancipation victory is amazing.New races (sponsors) - really basic bonuses, bland and dull characters.Only 8 leaders presented. Also - why the ♥♥♥♥ can you take artists as colonists and they apparently give you health bonus? Why? Who would do that? I dont get it.Unit upgrading is amazing. Just need some work on affinity system.AI sucks as much balls as in Civilization 5. Maybe even more.No soundtrack. Almost.Overall... meh. Needs some expansions and overall work. Not worth the money now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game has a massive amount of bugs in it. Two that affect me the most are not being able to run it in full screen mode on 120Hz+ monitors or via HDMI and AI that doesn't remember options that you've chosen and constantly asks you the same question over and over. Just yesterday, my game ended at the same time AI had asked me a question and it locked up the whole interface and I had to force quit losing any chance of saving it. This game lacks any original content and is very underwhelming. There aren't many civs, and the victories are too easy and disappointing. I cannot fathom why Sid would put his name on this. It should be titled ""2K's Civilization"" because it's rushed, full of bugs, and there is no communications about what's going to be fixed and when. This poorly made and expensive re-skin of Civ 5 is making me re-think ever ordering another civilization game again. It's shameful.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Who wouldnt wat a lazy remake of CIv 5? Pay fifty bucks so you can get the same game, but the only difference is we have aliens and it has darker colors! I've been playing civ since civ 4, I instantly bought this game because I trusted Sid Meiers, but I no longer trust them. This game is awful and is just like civ V but just given a different theme. Do not buy it unless it goes on sale for a penny. It's awful.			",27,5,0,3,9,0,20

												This is literally worse than Civ 5. There a bunch of different victory types, but they all basically involve building some kind of late game wonder and waiting x amount of turns until it makes you win.You can't have a culture victory because they removed culture, tourism, and religion.You can't have a diplomatic victory because they removed the world congress and turned city states into a single hex that you can make trade routes to. They also removed luxury resources and severely decreased the importance of strategic resources so you don't have anything to trade for. You can have a domination victory, but it's almost pointless, because as said there's no luxury resources and barely strategic resources. A domination victory doesn't flow over fighting for valuable resources. You just fight because there's nothing else to do. The game plays the same way every time. Look around at what strategic resource the game started you with, floatstone, firaxite, or xenomass. Then choose an affinity based off of that. Research all of the techs that increase that affinity and get your end game wonder. Spend all your culture on the prosperity tree and choose health on all the ""quests"" so you don't have negative health (happiness). Ignore your neighbors completely because they don't do anything. Wait for your wonder to win the game.			",70,8,0,12,4,0,19

												Civ 5 but stripped of everything the ideolgy progression is cool as you see you troops becomming more cyporg or alien like (if you go down the right affinity) but other than that I don't like it at all. It feels slow compared to both civ 4 and 5, and 4x games are not exactly fast paced games to begin with. Maybe with some very good expansions it might get good but... that sounds just like a cash grabbing machine and I hate it.  AND SOME HOW the multiplayer is even worse! Civ as always had a buggy multiplayer and would give civ 5 a 3/10 on multiplayer this one gets a whooping .5/10 just because it has it.			",54,2,0,10,3,1,11

												It's actually a step down from Civ V in a way. Civ V with the expansions has more options regarding things like the world congress and tourism. Civ V obviously also has a broader scope if you consider the techologies and stuff available in each age.The reason I recommend it however is that I find the pacing in Beyond Earth to be a bit faster and more dynamic. Things start to get interesting a lot a quicker. The early stages of Civ V can be a bit boring. The music is really top notch as well and the graphics are good. The wars can feel pretty dramatic.It fall short of the greatness of it's spiritual forefather, Alpha Centauri however, which was arguably better than it's counterpart, Civ II. Beyond Earth is certainly not better than Civ 5.Yet if you are a Civ fan looking for an alternate challenge/scenario, or new to this genre I recommend it as it's very easy to pick up and play. The faster pace does make campaigns quite interesting and if you are new to the genre and like sci-fi I would recommend. Especially if on a promotion! But if you are a Civ 5 fan looking for something better than Civ 5, i'd avoid it.			",335,45,13,77,33,8,113

												This is literally worse than Civ 5. There a bunch of different victory types, but they all basically involve building some kind of late game wonder and waiting x amount of turns until it makes you win.You can't have a culture victory because they removed culture, tourism, and religion.You can't have a diplomatic victory because they removed the world congress and turned city states into a single hex that you can make trade routes to. They also removed luxury resources and severely decreased the importance of strategic resources so you don't have anything to trade for. You can have a domination victory, but it's almost pointless, because as said there's no luxury resources and barely strategic resources. A domination victory doesn't flow over fighting for valuable resources. You just fight because there's nothing else to do. The game plays the same way every time. Look around at what strategic resource the game started you with, floatstone, firaxite, or xenomass. Then choose an affinity based off of that. Research all of the techs that increase that affinity and get your end game wonder. Spend all your culture on the prosperity tree and choose health on all the ""quests"" so you don't have negative health (happiness). Ignore your neighbors completely because they don't do anything. Wait for your wonder to win the game.			",70,8,0,12,4,0,19

												This reminds me of how Civilization 5 came out. All the customization is missing, so I am sure we will see 4-5 DLCs to ""add"" this customization in for the low low price of $49.99. If you want to play a turn based strategy game, go find a copy of Sid Meier's Alpha Centuari.			",57,1,0,20,9,0,30

												I can't reccomend getting this game. Maybe when it's a couple dollars on sale...The game was released with major bugs and overall feels unfinished. After nearly 2 months they finally released a fix, but that ended up breaking the game even more. For the support this game gets alone do not get this game.The gameplay is fun enough, similar to Civ5. It does add some interesting new gameplay which is fun to play through. One aspect I don't like is that you cannot disable Aliens like you could disable Barbarians in Civ5.All in all the game is ok, and would normally be something I'd suggest buying when you see it on sale, but given the support, do not buy.

												From the third person I had all but assumed this a heartless copy of Civ5 and now thanks to one of Steam's free weekends, I can now say it very much is. Although I cannot recommend it now, for such a steep price when Civ5 offers so much more, expansions could remedy this problem in time. So unless you're a fanboy, I don't see why any reasonable informed consumer would buy this until expansions are released.That said, the new tech tree is convoluted and innavigable. Clearly its a spin-off of Endless Space's and they somehow managed to make it impossible to know anything about what's in it unless you mouse over every last technology. I've been at it for some hours already and I've seen a slew of ""this guy made a wonder"" messages which I much rather have seen as pop-ups in reference to me but I still can't figure out what tech unlocks what wonder from a glance yet because its represented so terribly. If anything, I'd rather uninstall this right about now and dive back into Civ5, that is if Age of Wonders or Endless Legend didn't exist and weren't almost unquestionably entirely better games.The only thing good about this game is the slight branching-off of everything. Dependent on your affinity, you can eventually make this or that unit along with choosing one of two passive boons to a unit every now & then. Otherwise the new culture mechanic just splits off into four stale long trees of military, growth, science, and production choices. Factions are nothing more than someone from some vague area of the planet; African faction being a black guy, the French-Iberia one being some old French woman, and the Russian guy being a generic Ruskie. Nothing about this game stands out and the prospect of inevitable overpriced expansions doesn't provide much hope for the future of this game, as again this is certainly no longer the best 4x turn-based game series.

												Civilization Beyond Earth is without a doubt an excellent and fun game, sadly most of the reviews are trying to compare it with Civilization 5 + Gods and Kings + Brave New World or Alpha Centauri, but lets remember that expansions and dlcs should be released eventually and the game will become even better and also the game balance will come with time so dont expect a recently released game to be 100% balanced. I really dont get why so many bad reviews, this game definitely doesnt deserve it. Below I will point some pros and cons of the game and stuff that i would like to see on future dlcs/expansions:--> Pros:- The new aliens are a nice challenge on the early game, especially Siege Worms because you never know how they will react.- The new Affinity System is great, it gives players an option on how to devote their colony, so do you want your colony to remain pure and follow Old Earth ideologies? Or maybe make cybernetic enhancements on your people and spread chaos and havoc with robotic armies? Or maybe be one with your new planet and domesticate and integrate the alien lifeforms for your own purposes? Well, its your call!- The new map exploration is awesome, with your explorer units you search for Supply Pods which will give you small yields of Science, Culture or Energy and even a free Solar Collector or you can reveal the secrets of Ancient Ruins that will give you boosts on researches or the option for an affinity level or even investigate a crashed space ship which could countain the logs of a failed colonization mission giving you acess to new quests.- The new quest system is very interesting and offers the players many challenges across your games, the quests are generated based on how you are playing the game. Example: Spotting a Siege Worm will activate a quest that involves killing it and the reward will surely pay the effort, or making a trade route with a independent Station may trigger another Station to give you a quest to destroy their rival Station and as a reward they will give you a boost on the yields they provide. There are also quests that involves affinity levels and they will help you to develop you colony based on your actions during those quests.- The new orbital units are a great new feature, it allows you to deploy from Solar Collectors to boost the energy generation of your city to satellites armed with giant lasers that you can use both for defend or attack.--> Cons- There are very few sponsors (only 8) so there isnt much diversity on the games, at least they can pick different affinities.- The combat on Civilization Beyond Earth surely need some balancing, cities are much more powerful now and if you want to play Space Atilla early game it will be kinda hard since most units will be melted by the cities defense on the early game so you need to spend a lot of time on making very large armies if you want to conquer cities early on, however later on that is not a problem because the units at around 12 Affinity Level are already very powerful and it takes less than 5 turns if you are well positioned to conquer a capital, based on this the game pratically forces you to go for a domination victory on the late game where everyone else is at around 50%-75% on another victory type.- Trade routes are waaaaaaaaaaaaaay overpowered, every city can set 2 trade routes and if you get an auto plant you can get another one so basically its 3 trade routes per city. In my opinion a good number would be a max of 4 Trade Routes per Civilization and you can improve that to maybe 6 or 7 by making wonders, affinity bonus or quest reward.- The wonders on this game provides very weak bonuses, so most times you dont even bother making them because the bonus they grant you aint that great. The ones i usually make are the Ectogenesis Pod and the Gene Vault mainly to aid the city growth on the early game.- All the units are of the same color, ok you can see the colored icon but it would be nice if the units had your sponsor color.- Only 2 naval units, there is a ranged cruiser and a carrier, it would be nice if we could build submarines or a melee naval unit to conquer coastal city using only naval force.- The User Interface is confusing since everything is pretty much of the same color, seeing what is your city producing, on how many turns it will grow or how many turns to finish that beautiful wonder is very confusing and hard to see because everything including the small numbers are of the same color of your sponsor but im sure that can be polished.- The tech tree is nice and gives you freedom to focus on what you want, but it takes some time to get used to it and know what leads to what or what you need to reveal or improve the resources.- Covert Ops are waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay overpowered.--> What I would like to see on the future- A religion system that could work with your choosen affinity- More military units, especially naval ones- More sponsors, i think a number of 16-20 sponsors would give a good diversity to the game- Sponsors should have unique units/buildings. For example the PAC could have a special worker unit that improves tiles a lot faster and have +1 movement since they are focused on production or the ARC could build a special Spying Agency or another build which improves the spying activity.- Different alien types, it would be badass if there were different types of aliens based on the map type or something like that, that would add diversity to the game.- Improved military AI, sometimes the AI takes some very dumb decisions when you are at war with them.Well, thats my review for Civilization Beyond Earth, Im really enjoying the game and i believe that this game just need some polishing and im sure that with the future dlcs/expansions it will become even better than it already is.<<UPDATE>>Its a shame that Beyond Earth didnt receive all the love it really deserved, the expansion did good but the game sure could use of more content, sadly 2k left it to die and now the game barely gets 5k players, but the game is still amazing and u can have as much fun as u would have with civ5 but with an sci fi theme			",26,12,0,8,1,0,8

												How do I begin? I love Civilization Games. I have been here since the start. I did my best not to get too hyped about this game. I had been scared that this game would totally flop. I would have preordered a collector's edition without any hesitation. My fears were many.After really thinking hard and playing this game and trying so so hard to like it, even love it. I have to say that I am truly disappointed. I am too upset about it. Everyone else have made great points and I am in total agreement. This game lacks personality, creativity, and polishing.  User Interface is a mess, diplomacy is non-existent, the races are too bland, so vanilla.   So much potential, This game feels rushed.  Why did you do this Firaxis? Must I wait for an expansion for you to fix the content? I like the fact you took risks with the new affinity and tech system, I like the orbital layer, but it all falls short. There is only a small definite amount of units to choose from. None that are unique, no upgrades that are unique.  I understood the favor system in trade. but favors are treated like a commodity in this game, you trade it just like you would a resource. Which is terrible idea. Favors are called favors for a reason, and they should have more weigh. What went wrong? There are many major bugs? I couldn't play fullscreen with the correct resolution? You didn't care enought to play test this game?  Anyone would have been happy to? No need for paying anyone for beta testing!As much as I appreciated that you tried to take Civilization to the stars, you failed. I am sorry. Let's see how you can fix it.7/28/2015 - Dev still had no fixes, and decided to make us pay for a new expansion to fix it.			",46,8,0,10,14,0,12

												I dont know what happend here with Firaxis, all the last Games (Civ5, X-Com) I bought were absolutely awesome, including every single dlc, but this one is a bit weird. It looks unfinished/unpolished/unbalanced on all ends, even as the game is basicly the same as Civ5, but the graphics and coloration of the terrain/miasma and the techweb is horrible. Thanks to the community these problems have been fixed via mods allready.I would recommend Civ5 with both DLCs, before this one.			",50,21,0,22,8,0,37

												As of right now I cannot recommend you buy this game at its current state, There are issues with its multiplayer to begin with and when comparing it to Civ V (without or without the DLC) it, in my opinion is not as good. It is difficult to tell what type of terrain tiles are without mousing over it and the tech tree is so confusing and hard to memorize what everything is on it as things are not color coded well as to where I knew what everything was that is unlocked in the tech tree in Civ V like what building that is for example, and if you play with the AI's you will find that the AI avatars are very bland in this civ and lack any personality when compared to the colorful leaders of civ V. So like I said at this state I would not recommend buying CIV Beyond Earth, I recommend waiting for bugs and issues to be fixed and for DLC to be released which will most likely improve the overall gameplay.

												This game... is clearly is half-done.The AI is brain-dead, and turtles. There's NO threat at all of having war declared upon you.Even at higher difficulties, this game is a city-building sim, except you can't make more than3 cities until 200+ turns in.The UI is not intuitive, there's a lot of information that is missing that you should be ableto see in various interfaces, the civilopedia, diplomacy screen, etc. that is just missing altogether. You don't actually understand what everything DOES until you try it by playing a few times through.Aliens are only a threat to your trade routes and units that get too close, not to your cities.Affinities are mostly broken, wonders are underwhelming and aren't worthwhile - none aremuch better than a regular building, but at several times the production cost?!All of the faction leaders are bland. There's NO difference whatsoever in any of their behavioror characteristics in game - it's like eating a big bowl of cardboard.Don't buy this game until... actually, don't buy this game AT ALL.Don't buy anything else Firaxis develops from now on either, for that matter.This is yet another lesson, in NEVER PRE-ORDERING A GAME, EVER, FOR ANY REASON......not even if it's an overhyped, overpriced Civ game.

												When I play first time Civilization, I'm maybe six or five years old. Civilization III is my childhood game and I always start playing from Civ III. I really like this game - because of soundtrack, gameplay and one other thing - classic theme doesn't change. After I don't play Civ IV and V, I stop playing Civ III. When I heard somewhere about Civilization: Beyond Earth I get it. I think: why not. It's a few years when I last time played this series. My first reaction is: ""Wow. That game is really good."" Then I can't stop playing. In two weeks I played 40 hours and I love this game. That was the best strategic game what I ever seen. Now I played 210 hours - and I still love this game. I like this game and I would recommended it to everyone.Good things in Civilization Beyond Earth is:- really good graphics,- good AI,- nice dimploacy and culture system,- nice ways to win,- a lot of interesting quests,- hotseat games,- fun for a lot of hours.Bad things in Civilization Beyond Earth? I think there is nothing.			",38,5,0,3,4,0,4

The tech tree makes little to no sense.  Future techs are hard to model because we do not know what they are, but they have been done better in Alpha Centauri and many other 4X galaxy games.  Frankly, I just got bored.  I've started half a dozen games and just got tired of each of them before even completing them.  That, in my mind, is the hallmark of a bad game.			",88,32,1,30,26,0,38

												So, I've never really considered myself much of a strategy gamer. I find them very fun, but I honestly have the strategtic capabilities of a drunken  sailor  Admiral. Anyways, I own both CiV and Civ:BE, and I simply don't understand why BE gets the flak that it does. Maybe it's because I'm a sucker for Sci-Fi, but I find this game to be on par with CiV. Plus, with the Rising Tides DLC coming out soon, hopefully Civ:BE will no longer be looked down upon by the community. I mean, seriously. Hardly anyone plays CiV vanilla anymore, and I have a feeling that DLC will work wonders for this game, too.I'm going to stop writing this review now. It's late and I'm very much surprised I'm still forming coherent sentences. tl;dr, I'm tired and you should shut up and buy this game if you like Sci-Fi and stuff			",38,3,0,6,8,1,6

												Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth, takes the Civilization franchise into the Final Frontier. Settling an alien world, with new choices, familiar themes, allies and adversaries, I found the AI to be more sophisticated than even Civilization V, with alien creatures capable of wiping out soldiers with a single strike in the beginning of your campaign. You must be on your guard as the terrain itself can be hostile, with miasma deposits that damage you when you get near. The research tree is much more extensive than previous Civilization games, and is more dynamic, as opposed to linear, with branches and leaves to the research tree. I found this game to be more difficult than V, but it has a decent tutorial system to help you through the transition. I think for hard core lovers of the Sid Meier's Civilization series, you will have those who love it, and those who hate it, due to the changes. I think it is a pretty fun game, even with it's new features.			",479,176,24,74,66,6,86

												I don't understand why people rate this game poorly. As someone who used to play Alpha Centauri as well as many of the older Civ games, I can say that I was very happy with this game. I think the main issue is that people compare it to Civ V gold edition with all of it's DLC. I will admit that it's definitely not as replayable as Civ V at the moment, but I feel that when the Rising Tides DLC comes out it will give the game some new aspects that will make it more favorable.EDIT: 10/31/15Rising tides did make the game more replayable and added some new aspects. However it also screwed up the diplomacy system (which was then updated not too long after). Overall it was a nice improvment with the aquatic cities, hybrid units, and emphasis on exploration. Unfortunately it didn't increase the replayability as much as I would have liked.			",135,9,2,15,15,0,12

												Probably the weakest game in the Civilization series - coming from someone who has played II, III, IV, V and SMAC/SMAX.As many people have mentioned, Civ: BE is like Civ V, but stripped of half the gameplay elements (no luxury resources, no ""proper"" national wonders, no research agreements, no religion, etc.). Even the supposedly interesting parts (affinities, unit customization) don't make much of a difference, and the classic ""wonders"" fall flat.Outside of that, there are a quite a number of glaring issues with the UI (poorly comprehensible tech web, poor way to ignore unit upgrades for later, no way to truly tell how close players are to victories (simple scores don't cut it)) and bugs (uncompletable quests).Do yourself a favor, and stick to Civ V with GnK + BNW.

The technology sounds like a lot of neologisms without any underlying science fiction ideas to tie them together.  There is very little really new here for Civ V players other than the colorful terrain and units.  One of the biggest disappointments for me was to complete a special victory for my affinity and find out that there was no cutscene, no aftermath, not even a classic Civ-style graph of progress.  What is the point of having special victories attached to a story if there is no completion to that story except a 'You win' screen?  Very unfulfilling.

												Look, I love Civilization. I've been playing Civ since I can remember, it's where I learned probably <70% of my world history, and I'm 20 years old. I've been playing since Civ 2, and I can actually remember Test of Time coming out. I should love basically anything Civ. But for several reasons, I feel completely let down. 1. Several game crashes. I was prepared for this, lock ups happen and I set autosave to every other turn just because of this.2. The aesthetic is just terrible. It's a bland mix of greens and browns even with graphics maxed, you can't see units in cities at all and it's incredibly annoying to try to figure out what miasma is, and as a strategy game, losing 10% of your units HP can be a game losing mistake. 3. The tutorial SUCKS. Like, big time. I've played 14 hours and I still have absolutely no idea how I'm supposed to progress through the affinities. It seems like it's just random quests + using the gaudy tech web, which takes a lot of my agency away.4. The tech web is interesting, but it's unbelievably confusing. There are so many options and halfway into the game you've got 18 options and none of them are a clearly useful tech. The constraint of being linear in the previous Civ tech trees added elegance to them, this time the freedom has made tech wildly unfun. I could very easily see what my path was going to be in other Civ games, and lining up timings with other facets of the game was not just fun, but it was exactly why I played those games. 5. Combat unit upgrades might as well be random. They tie into the affinity system that is already murky with no explanation. Your affinity level translates directly into how strong your combat units are. This means that if you keep getting quests that require end game techs or to destroy Alien Nests when there are none near you, you lose to your opponent who ramps up 5 affinity tiers ahead of you and busts into your base. More lack of agency.6. UI falterings in hotseat. I wanted to show my friend this game because I was excited about it, but after 5 turns or so the graphics started disappearing, like the prompt that your city needs a new production. Some of the prompts also don't show up in single player as well, like city growth. Not being aware of what's going on in the game can be really taxing, the reason that Civ V had so many prompts was to free up the player's mental resources and make it more about the strategy and less about the memorization.There are a few more smaller problems, but all of these are core issues with the game. Look elsewhere for your 4X gaming for now, it will be a LOT of work to make this an enjoyable game for me.Edit #1 After playing another game, I ran into affinities being rewarded through excavations, another random element which the player has little control over, I got 4 affinity upgrades and destroyed my opponents because I had a massive unit upgrade advantage.Edit #2 After another couple of games, I've actually come to realize that the choices you make as a player don't really matter against the AI. So, if you're only wanting to experience an easy game in single player, go for it. There is a turning point at which you're just always ahead of the AI. Which is okay I suppose, if it weren't for screwy multiplayer.  Anyway, if you want to play single player alone, you'll get about 30-40 hours before you feel like you've done mostly everything.

												As a hardcore Civ fan I have to say I was more than a bit let down by this release.  I completely understand some issues are bound to be in the release version of the game.  What I am mystified about is the sheer number of obvious game play breaking bugs that were in the initial release.  And when I mean obvious I mean glaring in your face omissions.  I have to wonder what the internal testers were up to?  If core mechanics are barely functioning then maybe you should have just disappointed the community with a pushed back release instead of dumping a half finished game on us.  Sadly this game feels half finished.  The lack of even the most basic ending sequence was a major let down.  Want to see some stats on what you did? Too damn bad.  Expecting some neat cut scenes for world wonders?  Too damn bad.  The tech web was a let down as well.  In the end you have virtually cleared the whole thing anyway.  They only real choices you are making are within the leaves that concern the affinity system.  So the hype of ""choose your own path"" was complete hogwash.  Another let down were the actual units.  I get the affinity system changes the looks and abilities somewhat of the units.  It just seems very sterile.  Very few options for units.   I guess I was simply spoiled on older Civ games with a much wider selection of units.  In the end I can't say I am satisfied with my purchase.  I have hopes some patches will fix some of the ciritical problems.  So if your planning on buying I would wait a few months until the dust settles and pick this up on sale.			",10,11,0,11,19,0,12

												Good game if you are looking for a turn-based strategy game. The game lacks the ""metagame"" making it difficult to get immersed. Maybe it is because the setting is a foreign world, but the landscapes are very boring. No natural wonders to be found, no luxury resources, no dynamic and unique civs to be afraid to start next to, no randomly generated gorgeous bays and mountain ranges... 8 civs, 5 victory conditions, 3 affinities, but I feel like I have seen it all from 2 standard paced games. Civ 5 on the other hand I could still sit down and play a marathon game and have a new experience. That's what I liked about the old games. It always felt like you could tell a story about your civ. Man, I really wanna play some Civ5 now...			",133,36,4,36,45,1,22

It's clearly been rushed out at a huge price and will sell plenty based on reputation despite being a very mediocre game.Could have been priced as a Civ5 expansion but US$50 (or $90 if you're in AU/NZ!) is ridiculous.

												The main issue with this game is a matter of expectation. Many negative reviews were written by people who bought Beyond Earth at $50, at which price the expectations outweigh the reality. This game is not a revolutionary addition to the Civ franchise; it is a high-quality, space-based DLC for Civ 5. The combat mechanics, diplomacy, and overall ""feel"" of the game are virtually identical to Civ 5. In that respect, Beyond Earth is very similar to the Final Frontier mod in Civ 4 Beyond the Sword. Both games do not deviate far from their parent platforms, and they both introduce new ideas to the series. The only difference is that one is $50, and the other is free.Of course, Beyond Earth is different from Civ 5, chiefly in the artwork, which is great. Even in design, though, Beyond Earth has a hard time escaping the clutches of Civ 5. Sure, the units look completely different, but the same 12 man formation for infantry is present in Beyond Earth. Even the menus are identical to Civ 5, with sleek, futuristic text being the only change.However, in the areas where Beyond Earth really needs to be different, it succeeds big time. The affinity system is great, and it lends much needed variety to the game. Also, the tech web gives a new perspective on research, forcing a player to choose one technology at the expense of another. These two features give the game replayability, something needed in any good Civ game.I bought this game when it was on sale for $20, and I'm very satisfied. At $20, it's about the same price as a Civ 5 DLC, which is what Beyond Earth is, essentially. I'm perfectly willing to buy another Civ 5 DLC.Conclusion: Buy it on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Beyond Earth brings a good look at what humanity might have to face when it reaches a new world. The game play is similar to nearly all recent Civ games, you need to research for technology, culture gives you certain bonuses, etc. I do like how they integrated alien life and how they vary in strength. They seem to be similar to the barbarians in the normal civs, but they also have super strong units like the worm/leviathan that you still need to watch out for later in the game. it's a well balanced play, I would like to see maybe playable alien races incorporated in, but that might change the direction of the game too much. Overall, pretty good game if you like the civs, I wouldn't by it for $50, but $35 seems to be a good price for it in my mind.			",2,1,0,0,5,0,6

												I wouldn't recommend Civilization Beyond Earth at this point. It is extremely basic and barebones of a Civilization game, like playing a demo of something that was supposed to be grander. It doesn't feel like an alien world experience at all, the random roaming aliens are very generic, and every tile in the world (excluding miasma which is a hard to see and annoying unit damaging element that the AI is unable to pathfind around) is direct copy of Civilization 5 tiles. There is barely anything new to see in Beyond Earth, even though it's supposed to be an hostile alien world it ends up being less hostile and less alien than our very own Earth.The civilizations of Beyond Earth are also plain, there are only a few small statistic changes between them. They have exactly the same units, same city graphics, and obviously they are all human too, just different races / genders) so they definitely don't feel alien, just generic.Many of the things are just reskinned to look new, but underlying mechanics are the same. All alien resources are just normal resources in Civilization with sci-fier names, all alien tiles are literally the same functionally but just have a different visuals to them. Sadly even the visuals of the alien terrains are a bit bad, there are barely any variation (like visual difference between desert and plains, or tundra and grasslands) and everything is similar shades and covers. Mushrooms are alien, right? Lets put mushrooms everywhere. Purple is alien too? Yup, lets shade everything with it. Obviously every terrain type has their own textures, but the contrast between visuals of area is very very low.Happiness has been removed and replaced with health (it works the same, except your citizens don't get super healthy when they get ecstatic :D). Gold has been replaced with energy and at least I haven't seen much difference there. Policies have been replaced as Virtues and the Virtue system is more interesting (with bigger talent trees) but barely different from Policies of Civilization 5.Pure complaints aside, there are good things in the game too. It is nice to see a non-linear tech tree, even though they could have gone a bit wilder with it, instead they were afraid of really mixing things and ended up with half-linear tech tree that is more realistic but less fun as game mechanic. The satellite overlay is a nice concept, but they only work as temporary boosts. There is a simple unit tech upgrading system and it seems really nice.Perhaps at a later date in DLCs they'll fix and add things to spice it up. Currently it is not worth buying at a full price and you'll end up with very bad value for your money if you pay a full price now and add expensive DLC later.			",110,35,0,45,33,0,30

												Civilization : Beyond Earth, worth it? Sorta, but the price is WAY to high for the content that they have given us, to qoute another review; ""Get civ 5 slap on a si-fi skin and there's beyond earth!"". That is the most accurate and usful review i have found for this game. Two good points would be the spying and the tech web, the new spying mechanism gives you a feel of   difference and that your in control and it is very usfull to have 3 spies at the start and the tech web is very... different in a way that makes you wonder; ""what should i get next?"". Overall though, not worth the £40 and should be worth half that price or less. Hope you found this interesting.5/10 TheCatWithTheHat			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After playing a game of this, it feels way to similar to Civ 5.  I still love the one unit per tile strategy system but I would prefer to play Pandora with the expansions more.  There are more systems in Pandora than what Beyond Earth currently offers.  I am not a fan of the instant spy network and leveling up intrigue to cast huge capital decimating powers.  Feels there is little risk to just pumping this up.  There are really 3 different paths to take and to level up your military you should be pumping into an affinity to get more powerful units.  So instead of going for a specific research, any research with that affinity or quest will get you more powerful units - assuming you unlocked the basic version of course.  So to get the most bang for your buck, you can get a social/economical research upgrade and later on grab an affinity with it to boost military as well.  Overall I would not recommend this game in it's current state but that is about how I feel with every Civ game that first comes out.  This game really is about a $100 to be recommended and that is when the expansions come out.			",42,16,0,23,18,2,15

												If I had to give the game a grade, would a B, not the best game I have ever played, but it holds its own, and is fun to play.First off, comparing to to what everyone will do - Sid Miers Alpha Centauri - It looses out here, the main things I enjoyed in AC, the movies, the voicework, and the dark focus, are all gone. Beyond Earth has a much brighter outlook in most ways, the aliens aren't horrifying, the factions are kind of tame, and in general, things feel less intense.But, not comparing it to that, its an extremely solid civilization game. It feels much more streamlined than everything so far to me, with passive unlocks and techonoligcal boosts, units never don't feel like they go obsolete, and buildings steadily increase in worth throughout the game. The quest system provides customization to your buildings which is nice, but I still feel like there is one fundamental thing that dissapointed me in this game-The game is fun and streamlined, but it could have had so much more worked pumped into its story and presentation, and would be awesome if it had.

												Civ Beyond Earth is, at it's core, a very well done, thorough, and interesting MOD. It is not worthy of a stand-alone game. It's not worth the $60 retail price. As a life-long fan of Civ games, this one just isn't for me. It's opaque, glitchy, at times thrilling, but mostly very boring. Incredible promise, abysmal delivery.I'll continue to play it, just to see if it gets better with time, but my initial impressions will be hard to overcome.Overall, I think I should have stuck with Civ 5 and it's well-established mod community.

												As someone who has played Civilization 5 for 250 hours I can say that while this game is very similar to Civilization 5 it has enough differences to be worth the price tag in my eyes. However as the game is likely to recieve expansions and dlcs that will take it from a great game to a fantastic game it may be worth waiting for a sale before buying. My review will mostly be comparisons to Civilization 5. With this in mind here are my thoughts:Interface;The interface design on the game is tightened up a bit on the main screen. Its a bit more sleek. However as a result some information is a bit small and hard to find at first as a result. Very functional and works just like Civ 5 for the most part. The biggest interface complaint is the Tech Web. The mostly blue and white coloring along with the almost unnoticeable difference between wonders and buildings on it makes it a chore to look at and sort through. Fortunately mods are already coming along to fix this so its not as big an issue as it might otherwise be.AI:A little better but the same as always. The game explains why the AI hates or loves you though so their reasoning is a bit more transparent. Unfortunately the AI is as dumb as always and having played on Gemini difficulty mostly they seem to barely present a challenge to an experienced player. As usual it seems like the main thing that keeps AI players afloat is the massive amount of cheating they do but in this game it seems like they don't do quite as much of it. The staggered spawning doesn't really matter because the AI returns to parity quite quickly. All in all its the same as its always been with the AI in Civilization. I  personally find the AI to be the weakest part of this game just like in Civilization 5.Civilizations:What has been lost in variety from Civilization 5 has been made up for by balance and customizability. Providing a series of mostly balanced options the game offers you a chance to customize how your Civilization starts and prevents the first 5 turns from playing out mostly the same every time. While I do miss some of the more fun and unique units and buildings from Civilization 5 I think the system used here is overall better. The loss of Civilizations with terrible bonuses is good. These Civs do seem to lack personality but to be honest they never had personality in Civilization 5. Any personality attributed to the AI by players was created by the implied history of America for example. Gameplay:On the surface it appears to be incredibly similar to Civilization 5 and in a lot of ways, it is. Units can't stack, the map is hex based, resources are reskinned but the same, ect. Despite this the game plays quite differently with aliens proving more dynamic and challenging than barbariens ever were. Spies have been revamped and are both more useful and interesting. Trade routes work on a by city basis as opposed to a global limit encouraging massive trade empires. The culture trees promote far more diversification and interesting strategies with their synergy bonuses. The tech web, a huge change to the previous tree system of Civ 5 diversifies each Civilization far more than unique bonuses ever did and allows for many interesting strategies. Except for the Domination all the victories have been revamped creating interesting ways for players to win and allowing for a lot of time for other players to interfere. Expeditions and resource pods create more variety and must often be fought over by the aliens squatting nearby. Miasma while often irritating makes positioning all the more important. Sattelites, one of the bigger new additions have many varied and useful effects on the land beneath them. I could keep going on but in the end while most of the changes feel small in my opinion they all add up together to create a game that feels and plays very differently from Civilization 5. It is certainly an iterative sequel but it is a different game from Civilization 5 in a myriad of ways.I am greatly enjoying my time with this game warts and all and I look forward to the dlc and expansions that will make it even better.

												I have 676 hours logged in Civ 5. It was my first experience with the Civilization franchise and I loved the game from the beginning, though as expansions were released I came to realize just how lacking the game had been when first launched. Despite this, I would still have rated vanilla Civ 5 as a pretty good game. Naturally, when I heard about Beyond Earth I was very excited. I expected it to be very similar to Civ 5 but more polished and with innovative new systems that would enhance the user experience. I expected to get a Civ 5 game that was worth being its own game. I have been VERY disappointed. The jump from Brave New World to Beyond Earth seems to be the same as from Vanilla Civ 5 to Gods and Kings. This is a stand-alone expansion, not a full game. I can see the potential for it to be great, but it feels unfinished. I've played for only a few hours and I don't really feel any urge to play any more.In my first play through, I noticed the following negatives:-Some buildings don't actually work. I built a Progenitor Garden (+20% health in that city) and it did nothing. I spent a lot of energy to build it immediately and the building didn't provide any boost to health. I haven't built all of the building and wasn't really paying attention to most of the buildings that I did build, but I can't help but wonder how many other buildings didn't actually have any effect at all and were just wasting energy.-Units weren't cleared from the Unit Upgrade window. As I upgraded more and more units, they simply overlapped each other graphically in the window. This is not a game ending issue, but I would have expected small stuff like this to be smoothed out before release. It adds to the rushed and unfinished feel of the game.-Baffling AI. I actually had an AI offer to renew a trade with me and when I accepted it, they refused and demanded that I offer them more to continue the trade. THEY WERE THE ONES THAT OFFERED TO RENEW THE PREVIOUS TRADE IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!! There are too many examples of bad AI in this game, but this example really epitomizes the players experience in dealing with the AI in most aspects of the game.- Related to the previous point, general diplomacy sucks. The AI holds onto old grudes FOREVER. For example, if you tell them to not build cities near you, that has a negative effect on your relationship for the rest of the game. I know that this occured in Civ 5 too, but I really expected some better diplomacy and international relations in this game. It's been 300 years... get over it already!-Each colony feels the same. Each sponsor gives a unique bonus, but this is not enough to change the feel of the game. Playing as any of the sponsors feels exactly the same with no appreciable difference in cultures. Each of the sponsors is obviously supposed to represent some faction that controls some large portion of Earth, but aside from the accent of the leader, there is no difference in the look or feel of the resulting colonies these sponsors produce.-Affinities. First, I like the concept of the affinities: that each group would have a different approach to the alien world on which they landed. That said, I would have preferred to have a system in which I could choose affinity abilities like with ideologies in Brave New World except using these new affinity specific resources instead of culture.There were some things that I did like:-Quests. The quest system adds a new level of customizability to the game. After constructing a building, a quest decision is presented to allow the player to choose one of two effects to add to that building. For example, you might be able to add +1 culture or +1 production to all of a certain building for the rest of the game.-Improved espionage. I like the changes to the espionage system, though this aspect of the game also suffers from feeling a bit unfinished.-Tech Web. Rather than a linear progression through a tech tree in which you will inevitably end up with all of the technology eventually, the tech web requires more strategic planning as to which direction your colony will take.These are really fairly minor changes for a full game. It seems as if the developers decided that because Civ 5 already exists and was a big success, that they could get away with minor improvements, change the art, and pass it off as a full game. If this was a brand new franchise, Beyond Earth might have worked as a fresh concept. Civilization fans expect more than a passable game though. I will probably buy the inevitable expansions and/or DLC, but only when they are on sale; the improvements that are sure to come should have been included in this release and I refuse to pay top dollar for upcoming additions.I am actually very upset that I spent $50 on this game; if I could get my money back, I would. I will keep this in mind if you somehow manage to make another new Civilization game, Firaxis. Lesson learned... don't preorder because the game won't be finished.			",60,4,0,16,5,0,14

												TLDR: Fun early to mid-game mechanics, no soul, no end-game graphs.....  3/5. Would give a thumbs up if I at least had gotten the graphs at the end. The gameplay mechanics for this game were really fun. I liked the new terrain, the tech web (if not very intuitive), and quest options. Best part - definitely the quest options. Being able to customize what buildings do was really neat. The affinities were pretty cool too. I liked seeing my units get upgraded and change into the harmony units. Now for the bad. There was a serious amount of character lacking from the game. The silent characters seemed unfinished. I really wish that one of the leaders would actually speak. I almost missed the, ""Would you like to make a trade agreement with the Queen of England?""There were glitches with the character upgrade screen. I had a carrier and a cracken like creature all jumbled up in what was supposed to be the screen for the kraken creature.Also after beating the game, I got to the end, NO GRAPHS. I'm sorry but that really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off.After spending all that time playing, I really enjoy seeing my empire expand, seeing how much better I did than the other civs. It really feels like an ending. Instead you just get a, ""You did the ________ Victory!"" ""Exit, or Just one more turn.""That's when I felt like I got robbed. Where are the graphs???Overall 3/5. Fun mechanics for the most part. There seems to be a waiting game once you create one of the various final projects, that was annoying. I had two projects complete and had maxed out the harmony scale, and was at 8 on supremecy just waiting thirty turns to contact the other civilization.  ",41,5,0,16,1,0,5

												I wanted something with the depth of SMAC, I got CIV V with a space tileset and most features gutted.Improvements over Civ5* Quests are somewhat fun* ""Overpowered"" tile improvements, gives a little more depth than farms everywhere, similar to SMAC* Satellites are neatWorse than Civ5* Combine Health and Happiness to make the game dumber* Get rid of luxury resources to make the game dumber* Get rid of research agreements to make the game dumber* Get rid of great people to make the game dumber* Iteractions with city states is reduced to trade with them or pillage them for cash. Nothing else possible.* BORING QUESTS! Every time they're the same. At least give me 10 different ones that rotate or something. Nope, always ""Solid State Citizen""* BUGGY QUESTS! The quests ask you to do impossible things (improve a resource that doesn't exist, etc).* Aliens are boring so far (I'm not in the endgame).By far the most disappointing thing is diplomacy and the other factions. They all have no personality, beyond the vaguest sketch. (I spy on stuff, I like money, I am an African Villager(!), I am a soldier)  They pick affinities (roughly equivalent to ideologies in CIV V, except they give you units too) randomly with no rhyme or reason. Even the diplomacy text is the same as CIV V! ""Our disagreements have become too much to bear"", ""What do you think of this deal"". Add a LITTLE personality guys. It's pointless to even engage with diplomacy because theres nothing to trade! No luxuries, no research agreements, no votes. They just ask you for open borders, and want to declare war on eachother.			",124,24,0,26,19,0,28

												The game feels like developers are moving towards mobile gaming. It's not ""good old civ"" again. It's ""welcome to ios port of Civ"" game. It's simplicity is annoying to anyone who played previous Civilization titles. Especially if You are more than 12 years old and remember times of Civ 2-3 where You really needed to think. I actually feel like playing a mediocre RTS, amass army, crush Your nearest enemy, rinse, repeat. Even the technology advancement is a joke. You research technologies that just gives You basic options. And the acclaimed affinity choices are just plain silly. You do not ""choose"" you gain them with progress, and You would have to try very hard NOT to get them all, especially on Marathon (which obviously all of Civ fans chooses). Im seriously dissapointed, and would not buy this game if i had a chance to try it out a bit.			",56,6,1,14,6,1,15

												What a boring game! Ridiculous factions like ""Franco-Iberia"", dont want to play as these, dont even want to eradicate these. Bland technologies, buildings, ressource points, military units. Weak and passive AI. Feels like a low budget title. The science fiction scenario leaves so much unexplained. No videos, just more pop-ups with dry text. But dont mistake that for strategical depth, its the same things over and over again just with ever more unfamiliar names. In diplomacy faction leaders repeat the same few dull and generic lines over and over again, uninspiring if not tedious.Once the novelty of the unit animations and the terrain tiles wears off there is nothing underneath resembling a decent strategy game. Just the most basic and uninspiring game concepts known from Civilization V.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I absolutely do not recommend anybody spend their money on this game until that actually finish releasing it. They've done their normal thing (I don't know why I expected better) of releasing half of their ♥♥♥♥ing game so they can rake in more money by releasing the rest of it in expansions. It still heavily needs reworks with AI and balancing issues.I'm constantly getting my units glitching out on me. As with all civ games I've played the AI follows no logic, declaring war on me for no reason after being allies and strong trade partners the ENTIRE game. To expand on this, we made an agreement to attack our mutual all and imediately afterwards they turned and took my capital city. I understand *ohh ah backstabing* but we were seriously best buds the entire game he had absolutely no reason to declare war on me, nothing to gain and he lost a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of trade deals doing it... It litterally made no sense at all. I could of easily turned around and taken my capital back and wiped him out, but now I'm just so bored and pissy at this game I'm just not going to be playing it.

												After much anticipation and a deep love of the Civ franchise I was immediately underwhelmed. I expected a rich experience with strong depth, artistic graphical touches, engaging tech tree system, and immediate enjoyment. I have yet to experience any of that. In fact after the first 30 mins I found myself bored and disappointed. This is truly a let down and I'm hoping for major improvement down the road. It really is a stripped down version of Civ 5. I don't suggest purchasing this game yet. They should offer some free DLC to fill the holes. ",8,1,0,3,3,0,6

												The game seems like a pale and soulless rip off of SMAC; the factions are bland, the units are bland (what few there are), microing trade convoys is irritating as sin, there is no narrative as in SMAC (part of why I replayed SMAC for years is the immersive narrative presented through the wonder movies, tech and facility quotes), the aliens are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ barbarians (had 7 krakens sit under an orbital laser for 35 turns).Was incredibly stoked for this game, and found it to be a dismal let down; dumbed down even beyond what Civ 5 was at launch.

It is solid and fun and its own way.What upsets me about it, is this enormous wasted potential of what could have been a *really* great game.

Sid Meier’s Civilization: Beyond Earth – The Collection is a turn-based 4X strategy game. Fleeing Earth after the Great Mistake that ruined it, you land on a distant planet to establish a new world, building cities, dealing with rival factions and determining the ideological path you want humanity to take for its future to come. This review takes into account the Rising Tides expansion set.Pros: After picking from one of twelve sponsors and customizing your faction, you start off with a single colony, building units, researching technologies (through an improved tech-web) and expanding your borders. You also manage (or automate) trade routes between your cities, other factions and neutral outposts. You can now build floating cities that behave differently from land cities: land cities expand their borders through Culture points, while floating cities claim territory by moving around. Also, while land has plains, grasslands, hills and forests, the sea bed will have coasts, reefs and oceans floors with its own lot of strategic resources and unique bonus resources. The five biomes are more than land/alien color palettes, they determine the map generator's algorithm, defines alien strength, speed and behavior (much more varied than the barbarians from Civilizartion V), and each biome has a unique Marvel quest. The reimagined diplomatic system is a breath of fresh air from former games of the franchise: gone are the resource trading and tribute paying, you now accumulate Diplomatic Capital points from buildings and agreements others buy from you, which you then spend in purchasing agreements from others and picking personality traits (each unlocks bonuses and unique agreements). Peace treaties are now negotiated with the new Spoils of War system, comparing scores from both sides' war accomplishments, the difference is then used to determine the ""payment"" (technologies, cities, resources) the loosing faction grants the war's victor. Furthermore, A.I. behavior is now defined in fear and respect levels: fear being your military strength compared to theirs, while respect rises and falls over time based on how well your faction is performing (ex: production rate, health, land improvement, each rival caring about different things) and actions you take (ex: build wonders, attack common enemy's city, sign agreement with common friend). Through science and a few mini-quests, you accumulate points in one of three different human evolution paths: human purity, cybernetics or gene tempering, eventually settling into either of six paths (the three affinities and three half/half hybrids), giving a much needed variety to factions' tactics and appearance. Archaeology comes around with its own twist, as you dig up artifacts that can be consumed for an immediate bonus, or collected for a larger bonus (including unlocking unique wonders). The game looks awesome graphically, and the soundtrack is worthy of a space opera epic.Cons: As is was case with previous games of the franchise, it's an incredible resource hog, each passing turns getting slower as the game progresses no manner how powerful your PC is. The performance issues also cause textures to occasionally load wrong, and the game is constantly re-applying textures as you move around the map. The fact that each factions are randomly customized for each playthrough removed a lot of the individual personality rival civilizations had in past games. You get so many bonuses (affinities bonuses, building bonuses, sponsor bonuses, diplomatic agreement bonuses, Wonder bonuses, etc) that they become meaningless as they aren't as fun to get anymore. Even with all the biomes, planets, and customization, the game still feels somewhat repetitive from one playthrough to another and I can't put my finger on exactly why.Verdict: ★★★★☆ - Next on your list!This is not Alpha Centauri 2, but it's still a pretty good game (just as long as you get the Rising Tides expansion set. Seriously, it's required). The re-thought diplomacy, its twist on water-cities and archaeology, and all the flexibility for buildings, units and factions, are enough to make it its own thing. It might not live up to everyone's expectations, but I'll nevertheless be getting a few hundred hours of gameplay by the time my focus turns to Civilization VI, which in my book is plenty of bang for my buck. For all its flaws, it's still a game I recommend.—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												I reccomend this game with heavy reservations.Having dumped 40+ hours in it, I'd say it definitely is still fun. I had such a hardon for this game, but I was pretty disappointed in the end. The AI is terrible, I played normal in a massive Domination match, and was never attacked even though I played very aggressively and constantly spat in the face of my opposition, allowing me to slowly plow over the massive map over the course of 600 or so turns with little-to-no retaliation. Even mass-scale assaults were met with maybe 1-2 gun ships buzzing my infantry before being shot down.The spy system is a bit more advanced the previous ones, but it's the only thing the AI is good at countering, making it almost useless, but I haven't played it against a live person.The aliens, after you upgrade your infantry to level 3, aren't at all a threat, making clearing them a very, very easy task using a single of the mid-to-late game infantry to plow through them. Though, near the start of the game, the aliens can make expansion and resource aquisition extremely difficult, adding to the fun.In Civ 5, the barbarians leveled with you, making you constantly need to contend with them in heavier force than they had, but the aliens stay a measely 8-16 strength, and you'll have building defences that prevent combat altogether. The Seige worms (equal to a mid-level unit) are either far too aggressive early on, or not at all, leading to a quick death or a slight irritant. I enjoy the difference in technology routes, using Xenos as allies through Harmony, staying ""pure"" to humans, or going the cyborg/robot route, and the units aesthetics reflecting as such, but it doesn't really affect gameplay much, the individual perks barely changing between the three factions, as they're all more-or-less the same in combat, save for slight differences in mobility, which play much less of a role in combat than you'd think.The starting of the game can be an uphill battle, but once you're at the top, it's far too easy and smooth, even on higher difficulties.But, with some more expansions or mods, I feel this game will be one of the best Civs yet.Buy it if you've got the money, but I'd reccomend waiting.

												I've played every Civ game including Alpha Centauri.  I'm a pretty big fan of the games in general, but this one is a lame duck in my opinion.   The tech tree is messy and nonsensical, there are no faction specific units or buildings, and the unit progression is lame.  It is in every way significantly less good of a game than Alpha Centauri.  The fluff is boring, the end game is boring, the world interaction is boring.   Even though Alpha Centauri was an alien world,  it was easy to 'understand'.  The tech blurbs were sensible, the 'memoirs' phase of leadership added great fluff, units were awesomely customizable, the tech tree made sense.Beyond Earth doesn't make much sense, doesn't really seek to appeal to the user.   Building a wonder feels boring.  Resources feel somehow both boring and disconnected. It is literally like they took the worst parts of Civ 5 and the worst parts of Alpha Centauri and made a game from that.  There are some tiny UI improvements, I guess.			",100,9,1,11,9,0,39

												If you enjoyed CIV5 and love a sci-fi flavor on the best empire building strategy franchise out there, then I highly recommend you pick this game up. Nevermind the whiners crying about a lack of content, comparing this game to CIV5 + $80 worth of DLC. More content will come, and there is already community submitted content via the Steam Workshop. The new additions to this game from CIV5 are worthy of note, and definitely give the game a flesh of it's own; the covert ops game mechanic alone makes for an interesting addition to the different strategies you can use to achieve victory, the tech tree is an interesting visual interface change from the boring list you had in the previous game, the new quest mechanic is also a nice touch in giving each playthrough a unique feel.  If you are on the fence, I recommend at least trying the demo. I pre-purchased this game, and I have no doubt that it was worth every penny. I really look forward to what else Firaxis has in store for this game. Cheers.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth was not good. Hmm, maybe, that's putting it lightly, it kinda sucked. For a game that could have been great, it was sub-par. A glorified Civ V mod.Then Rising Tide came out. The 1st eXpansion for Civ:BE, quickly followed by two patches. What we have now is a good game.That's right, Civ:BERT (I love this acronym) is a good game. Is the AI perfect? No. It needs to learn how to wage war. But it does eXpand fairly well on the higher difficulties. It does a decent job with diplomacy. It has a reasonable mix of units. It reasearches well enough to beat me to wonders. The affinities got better with the new hybrids. Lots of improvements everywhere. I love the aliens and how they differ from one environment to the next, I just wish they were smarter is all.All in all, the game has improved, and dare I say that with another proper expansion with quick post release patching the game could really shine? Yes, I dare.If you want to read more, go check out eXplorminate.net for the in-depth reeXamination and Audible eXtension podcast.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I enjoyed Civ V but do not recommend Beyond Earth. This game is an absolute grind from start to finish. When your empire gets large, expect to spend tedious hours micromanaging your trade routes. The planetary environments lack variety, and tiles with toxic miasma can be very hard to distinguish. The aliens are bland and there's little joy to be had in exploration and discovery. The game is simply not very much FUN, and I can't see how updates and patches will change that fundamental problem.			",37,12,0,3,4,0,8

												I would have liked to enjoy this game. I'm a big fan of the Civilization series, and anything scifi is always a plus in my book. However, this game... Starting off, you have extremely limited options as to where to start your first city, which can seriously set you back in the early game. The science tree or graph or whatever is an absolute mess, nearly unreadable, confusing for old fans of Civ and completely overwhelming for any newcomers. All the tiles look the same (I had to hover over most tiles to figure out what they were), the aliens are absolutely everywhere, stopping your explorers and then randomly killing them for no reason... And the miasma, which could have been interesting, is just far too abundant to be anything but a serious annoyance. The actual civilizations themselves, or the colonies as they were, in addition to being very few in number, are also extremely bland and seem to have practically no differences from each other. The leaders have next to no personality, and all their little log excerpts seem to be dime-a-dozen platitudes about the loss of Earth and the squandering of natural materials - or then destruction of the aliens.It's such a shame, because this could have been the best game in the entire series with a little development. The basic idea was there, and there were so many ways this could have gone. I would give wads of cash for something more akin to Civ meets Mass Effect, where there's an actual variety of species and planet types. The civ leaders could have actual character, and the aliens, too - why were they not sentient? Why could I not play as them? Why are the aliens so meaningless to the game?And don't even get me started on the problems with the multiplayer. I got kicked out more times than I can count, and I probably stared at loading screens more than I got actual playtime in. Finally, I had to give up without completing the multiplayer game, because my constant dropping was making it stand still for everyone else. Additionally, the game would occasionally freeze for no reason and force me to restart it to be responsive again. I've never had issues like that with any other game. I don't know if the free weekend was crowding the servers or what, but it was basically unplayable.Such a shame. I guess I'll have to get my Civ fix and my scifi fix separately, then.

												A great twist on the Civ 5 engine. Keep in mind this game is not the next entry into the Civilization series, and that this game is essentially a large expansion pack, similar to ""Beyond the Sword"" in Civ4. This game is very enjoyable for a Civ vet like myself. I found Civ5 far too easy and Beyond Earth adds a very refreshing twist on the Civ 5 engine. The graphics are very similar with a redeisgned UI and heavily skinned scenery, but it does still look like Civ 5 in essence, which is good. The diplomacy system is heavily reworked here and reminds me of what we saw in Civ4, which is a very detailed lists of events and their impact on diplomacy. The techs in Beyond Earth are somewhat confusing, even after playing several times through it is still difficult for me to remember what is what. I don't want to spoil too much about the Affinity trees, but I think they are an incredible addition. They are essentially the idiologies from Civ 5, except now what you choose affects the appearance and abilities of your units.I feel this game is priced well for it's content, and the Classics Bundle is an amazing deal.

												A highly addictive game with plenty of room for improvment.After several days of gameplay you come to see that this isnt just another civ game, there are subtle differences such as aliens instead of barbarians that react to how you treat them. More focus on the strategic resources and three visually different worlds to explore.However you can see that the developers have some future plans, but could have gone further into the realm of scifi to make this game stand out more than previous titles. There is too much focus, I would say, on the strategic resources with plenty of late game units and city buildings requiring a vast quantity of these three rare minerals. Probably some further ballancing required. The tech web is a nice take on a new form of tech tree, you dont need to have each tech on the web to win, you can focus on what your colony does well, but even I, after some time of playing now have a prefered path through the web.The game to me is more finely tuned to exploration and an attempt to make each game different and allow you to make the most of the landscape or world you are on are quests, of which many allow you to make slight adjustments to your city buildings to give them some extra resouces. Dissapointment comes from some minor areas, few unit choices, theres only one aircraft that you can upgrade through the game to suit your needs, but this aircraft is a combined bomber and fighter. The same aliens no matter what 'biome' you see. An AI that can be a little too predictable with diplomacy that doesnt go as far as some fans would like. Dont get me wrong, I am an Alpha Centauri fan boy but like I have already said, this game had a lot of room for improvement, and the obvious holes are probably going to be patched with DLC or future expansion packs. Personally I would like to see more diplomacy options, further work on the randomness of the worlds, maybe more alien types each with a slight difference. More choice of units away from the generalised one for all options units. A deeper look into espionage, a couple of more factions as not to have the repeated leaders each time. For now, this is a great game and one I have been looking forward to since the release of Alpha Centauri. Im actually glad this isnt a clone but rather a close cousin to the game. Highly recomended and I look forward to what the devs come up with for the future.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great 50 dollar DLC.What? It's not DLC? You're kidding me, this is like Civ5 with a reskin.Oh. It turns out this is a full game, which was quite literally a reskin of Civ5 which they couldn't even polish up most of the things that shot that in the foot like bugs, bots, and not to mention an incomplete game. Seriously, Civ5 was like an incomplete game without DLC, and yet it felt more complete than this.I guess I should say something nice about it, fine, let's see. Uh... Graphics are pretty? Alright, alright, fine. It's semi-interesting and absorbing. The Miasma interested me on paper as a hazard to avoid, but with so much of the ♥♥♥♥ing stuff it just became something really inconvenient. Don't get me started on how clearing out aliens and miasma pisses off bots, what am I supposed to do? Learn to adapt so my lungs don't end up looking worse than after fifty years of smoking? Alright, so the combat is... ... Half-heartedly interesting. Not as absorbing or unique as the last games and your tech web can really stun your♥♥♥♥♥in place in the dark ages trying to figure out which part of the tech web gives you what you need.Overall, no. Just no. I felt like it was bad enough in Civ5 they cut out the spies and sold it on DLC, but now this is worse and only making me glad I got it on the free weekend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												People like saying that it is bad, but I disagree with that. People like saying that it is a reskin of Civ V, wich I disagree with as well. Beyond Earth has the affinities, the orbital layer, and satellites in general, better spying system (in my opinion), quests, the tech web, new resources which have a large impact on how a game will turn out (i.e. firaxite, floatstone), different units (as opposed to a civilization's special unit in Civ V, the affinity changes more than just a single unit). Aliens might be compared to barbarians, but you can not tame barbarians and have them help fight with you. The multiple special abilities you may pick from is a nice little feature to slightly impact gameplay, the trade system with foreign cities and outposts is good too. And when people say that it is a reskin of Civ V, its a Civ game. Did you want something else? I agree that the colors are dull, but other than that I would say that Civilization: Beyond Earth is a good game.			",36,6,0,6,10,0,18

												Well... coming from someone who started playing Civ Rev on xbox 360 and then Civ 5 along with reading all the negative review, I thought this would seem like a  horrible game. But, since it was free for the weekend... tried it out anyways.Pros:New features- felt like I was colonizing a new worldNew HudNew 'Idealogies?' that change unit looksSatellites and exploring for resource pods/ crash sitesCons:Lack off AI conversingSeems like I'm fighting aliens more often then the AIs themselvesManaging large empires is a pain due to energy and health factorsMap maximum size seems like small or medium size from Civ 5 Overall I do think this is a unique Civ game of itself and excessively fun (9hrs straight), I probably wouldn't buy it till more dlcs come out first.

												After playing about 3 hours of this game i have made up my mind for this game, so here is my review.The game is pretty much a carbon copy of civ 5 with no changes apart from theme and technology apart from that its the same and you may as well go buy civ 5 for cheaper, the game isnt worth £29.99 at all.The game is a disapointment because i thought it would have more to do with you going into space and all that but instead you get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ satellites which in my opinion are ♥♥♥♥ing usless and boring.The aliens are really that interesting and the technology takes for ♥♥♥♥ing ever so i sat for 3 hours on one game and still havnt got any real cool tech or units.The graphics also havnt really improved so again proves my point carbon copy.My opinion dont buy the game stay away from it and just get civ 5 because this is just horrible.

												A highly addictive game with plenty of room for improvment.After several days of gameplay you come to see that this isnt just another civ game, there are subtle differences such as aliens instead of barbarians that react to how you treat them. More focus on the strategic resources and three visually different worlds to explore.However you can see that the developers have some future plans, but could have gone further into the realm of scifi to make this game stand out more than previous titles. There is too much focus, I would say, on the strategic resources with plenty of late game units and city buildings requiring a vast quantity of these three rare minerals. Probably some further ballancing required. The tech web is a nice take on a new form of tech tree, you dont need to have each tech on the web to win, you can focus on what your colony does well, but even I, after some time of playing now have a prefered path through the web.The game to me is more finely tuned to exploration and an attempt to make each game different and allow you to make the most of the landscape or world you are on are quests, of which many allow you to make slight adjustments to your city buildings to give them some extra resouces. Dissapointment comes from some minor areas, few unit choices, theres only one aircraft that you can upgrade through the game to suit your needs, but this aircraft is a combined bomber and fighter. The same aliens no matter what 'biome' you see. An AI that can be a little too predictable with diplomacy that doesnt go as far as some fans would like. Dont get me wrong, I am an Alpha Centauri fan boy but like I have already said, this game had a lot of room for improvement, and the obvious holes are probably going to be patched with DLC or future expansion packs. Personally I would like to see more diplomacy options, further work on the randomness of the worlds, maybe more alien types each with a slight difference. More choice of units away from the generalised one for all options units. A deeper look into espionage, a couple of more factions as not to have the repeated leaders each time. For now, this is a great game and one I have been looking forward to since the release of Alpha Centauri. Im actually glad this isnt a clone but rather a close cousin to the game. Highly recomended and I look forward to what the devs come up with for the future.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Firstly a thank you to the devs for giving us a free weekend to play this. However as much as I love the Civilization 5 series, I cannot bring myself to buy or play this version.The game looks like a modded reskin of Civ5, and not a good one either. The maps look dark and ugly, and no care was given to improve the engine or the UI (in fact the UI is significantly inferior). There are still heavy black loading artifacts as you move through large maps, some tiles still fail to load unless you zoom in, on and on. But worst of all, in many areas Beyond Earth is much worse than Civ5.For example, when a pop up window appears in Civ5, it darkens the rest of the screen to get your attention. But you still have access to all your vital stats like happiness, gold, culture. In Beyond Earth, all this information is blurred out, making it unreadable. So when you get a quest popup giving you a choice between health or energy, in order to check which one is more useful to you right now, you need to cancel the quest, see your values, then reopen the quest. Such stupid design choices.Then there are the trade routes. They are no longer limited, so then you have massive colonies with dozens of cities and trade routes, almost every turn it pesters you to reset a trade route. No care was given to optimize this.The use of screen space by the UI is also very poor. When you click on your city to see which buildings you already have, or want to construct, the physical size of those buttons is twice as big, and for no reason at all. They just added blank space. There is so much scrolling now that in most cases it's not worth the effort.The game setup UI was never a thing of envy in Civ5, but it's even worse in Beyond Earth. There are still no user-friendly visual aids to show you how the map may look with your settings, and they even removed features such as disabling aliens (the new barbarians).Moving on to production value. It does not stand up to Civ5 at all, even before its expansion packs. One my biggest disappointments (and there were many) are wonders. When you get a Wonder notification, all you see is a cheap blue-print sketch. Combine that with the lack luster map environments, it makes the game look even more monotone.My conclusion? This is not a good deal even when it eventually drops to 80% off. Civ5 is a superior game in every way.			",121,1,0,9,8,0,12

												Honestly what can I say? There's just so much wrong in this game and most of it has been summed up by the previous reviewers. The characters are worse than some of the faction mods found in Civ 5, the game isn't that much of an improvement over Civ 5, it is very very expensive for absolutely no reason. The replayablity isn't too great, the mods are too few, the multiplayer isn't that good. I can go on on about why the game isn't worth your cash (or in my case, the 2 day free trial given out and even then I barely wanted to play it), but if I had to sum it all in one message it would be wait until the next sale, and get the Civ 5 complete edition with all DLC for $12 like I did and you will not only enjoy it more but also save a lot of money. I'm very upset at how poorly this was thought out considering I was really hoping to have a good Sci-Fi Civilization game because Alpha Centaruai is way too old.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've played just a few hours of this and the thought that kept popping into my head was: ""I'd rather be playing Civ V"".BEYOND EARTH is not a bad game. However, it seems like some kind of a missing link between Civ IV and Civ V. The main problem with it is that the factions are pretty much all the same. Instead of taking advantage from the Sci-Fi theme and come up with some really eclectic, interesting and MEMORABLE factions, everybody has the same generic units and buildings. The faction advantages also so balanced that they don't matter at all. It doesn't keep you involved and rooting for your own guys, because your guys, their guys, they're all the same guys.

												Beyond Earth continues the recent trend of Firaxis where they create a pretty game, but the AI is so laughingly incompetent unless it gets huge boosts to disguise that. My guess is that it is somewhat magnified by the design, which while having a few interesting elements is far from clean and approachable.The user interface seems to have taken some hits even compared to CIV V, lacking quite a few attributes it had and lots of things implemented without completion.I'd recommend waiting for a free weekend and finding out if you don't mind the real lack of depth once the discovery phase is over. I know isn't good enough for me to purchase, especially when taking into account that it needs those expansions it yet doesn't even have to stand a chance of being something for me.

												The concept behind this game sounded pretty sweet, but in practice, this just feels like an incomplete Civ 5 with a fresh (and confusing) coat of paint. The base mechanics are all the same, only renamed to sound space-y and futuristic and barely any of the improvements brought by the Civ V DLC are here. Whatever new mechanics are added, they feel poorly implemented at best, like they know they're gonna release 30$ DLC in the future to rework them (as is likely the case).-The Affinity system looks interesting at first, but it's entirely reliant on the the tech tree (or rather ""web""), so if you're not focusing solely on producing Science, you're not gonna get anywhere, fast. -Everything depends on Affinity now, from Victories to Unit upgrades, and unless you're devoting yourself to one Affinity, you can't do anything productive.-In fact, apart from Domination, all the victories are basically differently flavoured Science victories now, as Diplomacy and Culture have been all but removed.-The new Tech Web also seems interesting at first (a common theme with this game, it seems), but it quickly loses focus, because you have to go for the Affinity-adding techs, wich are spread seemingly at random on the Web. So on one hand you need to concentrate on Affinity, but that means randomly picking different techs... It quickly becomes a mess, considering the next point.That new tech-y coat of paint... The great thing about Civ was how quiclkly you could get into it. The Units, Buildings, Leaders, even Wonders - you took one look at them, you knew who they were and what they did. Now, it's basically stabs in the dark. You have no idea what each unit is by glancing at the name (like when you're deciding what to Produce next), the Leaders are completely interchngeable, the Wonedrs are basically random bits of words stuck together to random effects... And since you can't help but to compare this to Civ V (and you have to, because the gameplay is identical), it looks just awful.-Oh, and the worst part - instead of Spock's (or at the very least Spock's sound-a-like) soothing narration you get something that sounds like a teen girl, narrating random quotes by the fictional ""leaders"".. Yeah, actual quotes from actual people have been cut too....There are good points - the Espionage system is expanded and the new Quest and Decision systems work really well. But that's all, really.Most of all, this just feels like a big new scenario for Civ V. And if that's what it was, instead of a full price game with several full price DLC coming soon, that would be pretty awesome. But now, it feels like a big step beck for the franchise, not justifying the full price.			",128,9,0,5,7,1,8

												I'm partial to historical stuff so already I was probably setup to not like this.  Still I gave it a try being a major civ V fan.  To me it doesn't feel like a seperate game.  I feels like a well done mod for civ V.   I've played a few mods for civ V that completely change the game such as Faerun.  Faerun was free, and this was 60 dollars.  Can't recommend.  I feel it's worth possibly 5 or 10 dollars.  Still, I may give it another try down the road.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Save your money, get civ 5 and all the dlc and access to the workshop and create whatever the hell you want.  ♥♥♥♥, call em space units and use your imagination.  IMO, it's much better than paying 30 bucks for this.  Did anyone get higher than level 2 on a city during espionage?  Did anyone have trouble finding energy to fuel your army?  Did anyone else get blown out of the water by an AI civ?  Plus, the game didn't work well on my computer, so chalk that up as another minus.  I do not recommend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Early-game is a unique experience.You establish your first base, weak, fearful, and kinda hungry.You send out explorers, avoiding the miasma, and the aliens, only for them to get surronded by both.You send out soldiers, only to watch them get slaughtered almost instantly.You send out trading vehicles, only to watch an alien eat them on the way to a station.For this is the frontier of humanity, and the rule of the jungle applies here. You eat them, or you get eaten by them.Late-game is like Civ V, you kill, you conquer.The usual stuff, just with different units.Still, good game.			",61,7,0,9,12,0,28

												After playing about 3 hours of this game i have made up my mind for this game, so here is my review.The game is pretty much a carbon copy of civ 5 with no changes apart from theme and technology apart from that its the same and you may as well go buy civ 5 for cheaper, the game isnt worth £29.99 at all.The game is a disapointment because i thought it would have more to do with you going into space and all that but instead you get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ satellites which in my opinion are ♥♥♥♥ing usless and boring.The aliens are really that interesting and the technology takes for ♥♥♥♥ing ever so i sat for 3 hours on one game and still havnt got any real cool tech or units.The graphics also havnt really improved so again proves my point carbon copy.My opinion dont buy the game stay away from it and just get civ 5 because this is just horrible.

												I really cannot say I recomend this game, nor would I disrecommend it. It uses the same engine and same diplomacy trade ect ect ect as CIV V. Which is not a bad thing per se. As I understand when Civ V first launched it was not received well but with the additions of DLC it became a much better game. Both good and bad. It is bad because we will have to purchase a 30 dollar DLC to make this a truly great game. I will say however that the other civs were useless. I suppose I am only mostly though my first game but I found little interactions between the other Civs. This is probably due to the lack of luxury resources however. The aliens will be your primary threat as the other civs are rather docile. I am disappointed by the wonders in this game. In Civ V it was something special with music and a picture and a quote. Now its just meh. The affinities are a great new addition and it is neat to see them mix and mingle with how the other civs leaders look. and they provide nice little bonuses as well. According to the affinity you have the highest rating for some civs will love you and others will hate you. Either way this game is very similar to civ V. if you liked civ V than chances are you will like BE as well.			",3,0,0,0,0,0,6

												(Version fr de mon commentaire plus tard....)Well.... I played the free week-end version until the end (5 turns before the end of my game by Emancipation) and..... well.... where I must start?ok, the goods points for this game (Better to call that beta mod):- The Idea of the 3 ideologies are good, like religions in Civ 4, especially the point where you can use different hybrid ways for upgrade unity.- Science star instead of tree is a good idea, but a bit confuse when we want increase the 3 ideologies...- Graphics are good, I like the futurist-style interface, too bad, this one is... incomplete!.- Different way to victory- Quest are various and are the best idea in this gameBUTAll of those ideas and quality are not complete!- The Diplomacy is very bad in comparison of Civ V (By the way, you copy-paste the diplomacy text from Civ V...), I talked with pacifist hippies who give to me everything I wanted, and I liked the ""Atrocity"" parameter in Alpha Centaury, where is it? Too bad, you put it in the trash, like every good idea in Alpha Centaury (The only one thing I disliked in AC was the graphics).- IA stupid: (By information, I was at the 4th difficulty level, with no bonus for me and normally an IA more offensive) He let many ruins alone around him, my explorers get them easily. In add of this, one of them (india) had an opportunity to kill me with a big army, but he doing nothing. And let me the time the build a better army after spying them...- low level Spy too much powerful!!! I mean, all science progress and energy was from them! The option in risk 2 is useless (why stole technology when you can stole science with less risk?), the one in risk 3 is less interesting than the precedents, and the risk 4 and 5 are impossible to execute, but are they more useful, the city is usually at 2, 3 maximum, good luck to get more access.... in all Civilization, stole science was the most dangerous option for a spy, so here..... why?- Some bugs (not important), and some options was disapear in the option screens: where is the overview of the army? The inventory of all resources exploited? They disappear! That was useful in Civ 4 and 5 for the player, so.... why????- Culture is useful only for the science section, that all! Prosperity, industrial and military section are no enough efficient!- In fact, the only difficult I get is the wealth, always negative until you get a final technology who change radically this problem...- This game is chronophage, but not in the good way!I see you have many good intention and Idea with Beyond the Earth, so, please, Firaxis's Civ-team, rework that game before sell it for 40€! Even 30€ is too much!			",26,7,0,8,3,0,13

												This game has a civ 5 feel to it, but it is not civ 5. I enjoyed it at first but after a couple of games I could feel this game is not balanced well and there really isn't any depth to it. When they did their fall update I couldn't even try to play it again. A full month later they release a ""hot fix"" and now it's playable again, but I see no point in doing so. If your looking for a good civ game go with civ 5, I have over 500 hours in it and am back to playing that game. I hope dlc will help add some depth and make this more enjoyable, but as of now it's certainly not worth the price.			",25,13,1,13,53,1,24

												I put off buying this for a LONG time.  Finally, it's on sale for 10 bucks and I thought ""Why not?"".WOW.  What a disapointment.  At first it seemed exciting and fun but with each turn I began to see that something was just wrong with this game.  Balance issues, terrible graphics even on the highest settings.  I knew by the end of the 50th turn that this was going to be a refund request.Terrible and a HUGE disapointment considering Sid Meier's name is attached to this mess.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Honestly, I don't understand the negativity behind this game. It's very different from the last games in the series (more like a branch-off instead of a full blown sequel. Unlike the previous titles you don't experience the development of mankind, you experience what would happen if mankind found a new planet. That's probably why people are upset.Give this game a try and don't listen to the ""it's a Civ V mod"" kind of people; they're not creative enough to post any kind of criticism and are devoid of any intelligent thought.

												After briefly trying this out on the free weekend, playing it multiplayer with 2 others, I have, along with my 2 mates, decided that this was a waste of time and hasn't got a patch on Civ 5. People are calling this a re-skin of Civ 5, and in many ways it is, but it's also a rather very flawed game with dull mundane mechanics.Less time I spend writing a review for this game, the better...Avoid!

												I'm going to be blunt, this is crap. I was expecting some more to this, but its just civ 5 with a space texture pack and a few new things. With all of the things just like this made before it, I would expect this one to be even better, but sadly, its even worse. The whole map is filled with the same things over and over, and maybe its fun for the first play-through, but after the second time, you get bored. Fast. For what this game contains, $50 is overpriced by a lot, $10 is what this game should be valued at. I was expecting something fun that I can enjoy everytime I play it, but this game is not that game.			",54,7,0,13,11,0,3

												Excellent Game. I have around 40hrs offline on it at least. 100% Fun I read many of the reviews and was worried about this game being full of bugs. Personally its worked GREAT! No Issues playing on full HD Ultra settings. If your a fan of this type of game your in for a real treat. Seriously give it a shot. Few minor things I'd liked changed of course would be a better AI to fight. Increasing the difficulty only gives them a cheating advantage instead of making them a better player. Sadly quite common in most of these games. The Soundtrack is off the hook! Graphics are intense.  Computer loves to trade for FAVORs. Also lame unless they took these favors more seriously. Covert ops are great but VERY hard to get up in the more gameplay effecting Black Ops. OVERALL despite a few minor tweaks I'd like to see in this game and others GREAT JOB FRAXIS Please create more Colonies Or another affinity New Aliens would Rock also. Great balance Don't screw that up with DLC thanks again			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: December 8, 2015
												I've been holding off getting Beyond Earth since it came.  I've been a huge fan of the series since I was a wee child.  I used to play civ 3 with my brothers, then i played civ 4, and then onto civ 5.  When I heard they were making another civ I was really excited,  each new installment had been an interesting new development.  I admit I was rather skepticle of civ 5 and took awhile to get into it.  I really hope Beyond Earth turns out to be the same although I don't see it happening.When I first saw gameplay of it i thought, hey... this looks a hell of a lot like civ 5.  I was right, except it's worse.  Whereas civ 5 gives the clear progression of technology, beyond earth has this horrible confusing tangle, which lets you (try) to jump straight from what would be ancient era, into the modern era.  I say try because the tech will let you sit there researching your butt off for 150 turns until you get it.They tried to reimplement health, from civ 4 into Beyond Earth but really it's just a replacement for happiness from civ 5 except without a good way to generate it.  I found myself, after settling one new city struggling to even maintain net 0 health.  Being attacked by, and capturing a city of some randomly named♥♥♥♥♥hole only plunged me deeper into unhealthiness, when annexing the city said it would give me 0 increase...Aside from gameplay issues this game just doesn't feel clean at all.  I started it up for the first time and immediately noticed how jerky everything seemed to be going.  I was moving the mouse across the screen as if my fps was 2 when it said it was 1200.  I figured of course it would be because the ""optimized"" starting graphics would have messed it all up as always happens so i went in and reset them all.  As soon as I changed the resolution everything seemed to clear up.  The mouse moved smoothly, just the way it should and I was relieved.  I thought I'd solved the problem. How wrong I was.  See, changing the other graphics settings from minimum to maximum said it required the game to be restarted, which I did without fuss.  Only to find my horrible stuttering mouse returned on startup, not only that, but for some reason my mouse was overlayed on the screen during the opening cutscenes, as well as the loading screen, before turning into the regular civilized mouse you see in game.  I went back into the options to make sure everything was set how it should be, which it was not.  Everything had returned to minimum settings.  Feeling slightly miffed I set the resolution back to 1920x1080 59hz and instantly noticed my mouse had smoothed up again.  ""This isn't right I thought to myself, what's going on here.""So I decided to have Nvidia GeForce Experience set my graphics for me.  It worked, set everything to max just like it should and I started up the game.  Again, mouse overlayed over the startup, no sound until i get to the menu, horrible buggy mouse.  I go in, change the resolution to something else, then back to clean up the buggy mouse and decide to start the game out for real.  Give it a test drive.  I must say I did enjoy the starting bonus selections.  It was like taking the best parts from all the nations in civ 5 and putting them into one perfect nation to suit your play style.  However I was quickly thrown by layout of the UI.  Small things were annoying, the map was in the top right, instead of the bottom right like in EVERY OTHER CIV GAME EVER.  The buttons to exit various menus were all in different locations so there was no ""go to exit button"" which you don't really notice in most games because it's not a problem.  I decided I was going to get a mod to replace the UI with one more similar to civ 5, just so things felt a little more comfortable.  That's where I went wrong, see.Upon opening the in-game steam window with shift+tab i knew something was very wrong. Nothing was responding when I clicked it.  The ""hover over"" indicator on some of the buttons would light up when the mouse was nowhere near them.  It was like everything was offset and I couldn't tell where I had to click to do anything.  Then the game crashed and the whole thing starts again.  First fix the jerky mouse, then go to mods, open the steam window and bam, it's still all messed up.  Surely restarting the game should have fixed it.  But no.All in all, the game just feels horribly incomplete.  Things don't work the way they should, small errors on top of small errors compound into a game that's no longer enjoyable to play.  Add that to the fact that the game is really just a retextured version of civ 5, with a less cohesive research screen and city modifiers that make no sense and you get a game that's just not fun.Civ 5 has its bugs, many of them, but compared to Beyond Earth it's a well thought out, planned, and implemented game.  Civ 4, a masterpiece if a bit dated.  Don't get this game.  I got it when it was on-sale for like 75% off and I still regret wasting the money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Civ Beyond Earth or Civ VI as I guess you could call it... what can I say about this game that people haven't said or thought about already? Well... to be honest, I rather enjoy this game and maybe, just maybe. Not for the reasons you the reader think I enjoy this game for... or at least possibly some other reasons which you didn't expect or believe.Let's get the biggest issue out the way first, the Faction Leaders, no matter which way you look at them or analyse them, they will never hold the weight of the previous games historical leader. That was part of the charm of Civ V, you could have Nobunaga Oda, the demon king of Japan go up against Alexander the Great in an epic war. Part of the charm of Civ V was that you could create this entire parallel world where these leaders are all alive round the same time and at each others throats, that was part of what made Civ V great.The Leaders in Beyond Earth will never be able to compete with that, they won't. So don't expect them too, Beyond Earth in my opinion was an experiment, using a new idea and a new setting that is completely different from Civ V.That being said, I do agree that the new Factions are a little bit in-balanced, especially when analysed together. I do like how the cultures and the peoples of Earth have banded together in the future to create these new... almost Mega-Cultures I guess you could say that which to gain control of this new planet... planets depending on which map you pick.One thing I will say about the Factions and the Leaders, is while they will never live up to the weight of the historical leaders of the past, I do believe they hold potential. Here is how I look at Civ Beyond Earth compared to Civ V. I look at Beyond Earth as Civ V was before Gods & Kings and Brave New World. That is how I look at Beyond Earth, I see it as a diamond in the rough that has a massive amount of potential and I pray, I really do pray that Firaxis follow through with this potential and continue to polish Beyond Earth because, it truly does hold a massive amount of potential I would be devastated to see wasted.As a lover of the Civ franchise I read, watched and basically hunted with purpose, everything I could about Beyond Earth before I purchased it only 2 days ago. I currently as of this review have 25 hours logged on Steam playing Beyond Earth compared to my 239 hours logged for Civ V.So, you could claim that this review isn't valid if you don't believe I have spent enough time playing the game to give a fair opinion and review, fair enough but I am giving it anyway. Recently I saw one of my favourite YouTubers give a review on the game, AngryJoe. He said and I quote ""Beyond Earth feels like an incredible opportunity wasted."" I do not agree with that, I agree the game doesn't live up to the expectations that were presented for it then again, we are talking about a Civ game, possibly the best strategy game franchise ever, in my opinion. I don't know, maybe Total War is better I have yet to play a Total War game but I plan on getting Shogun 2 which seems to be the best choice.Back to the point, I do not believe the game is an opportunity wasted, I believe it is a diamond in the rough that with the proper care and love and grow to become something close to Civ V, I doubt it will ever beat Civ V mostly due to the weight the historical leaders brought, but it has a fighting chance of being close. However, you must remember, Civ V has G&K and BNW whereas Beyond Earth has nothing so far, which, is why I look at the current state of Beyond Earth as of the post date of this review as Civ V was before G&K and BNW enhanced the experience and made it something truly amazing.I feel I have ranted on a little more than I should of about the comparison between this game and it's older brother Civ V but it was a point I felt I had to explain my own opinion for.Let's move on before this review goes on for longer than it should. I've heard Rythian of the Yogscast another of my favourite YouTubers talk about the graphics of the game, how they look dirty and muddy. Honestly, I cannot tell as I haven't played the game on High or higher graphics, I play on Medium level as I use my laptop and the game runs perfectly so I may try a higher setting so I can look at it in full detail and have a better opinion. However, I agree and disagree with the comments they made, about the graphics.I agree they do look dirty and muddy, they definitely have a darker colour palate for some terrains and a brighter one for others. These are enhanced through Mods which are easily integrated with the game through the Steam Workshop and if you play with the Distinctive Terrains mods, you will see more detailed terrains so I do recommend playing with those Mods just for the visual effect.As for the graphics for the units and the cities, I honestly am not too sure. I feel they suit the purpose enough, they suit their purpose enough. I don't know, maybe as polish is added to the game as I believe it will, this is Firaxis we are talking about, as more polish is added to the game they may upgrade the textures to make them more pleasing or eye catching but for the most part they are descent enough.Hmm... what else is there for me to talk about... I seemed to have focused a lot on what other people were saying about the game and what I believed so I am a little stick... bear with me a moment here. Okay, the Aliens, something you will be seeing a lot in Beyond Earth.Personally, I believe these Aliens are done well and they are impressive to look at, especially some of the unique Harmony units like the Rocktopus and the Xeno Titan. However, the only game in which I got the Rocktopus it seemed to be bugged and wasn't able to move to the orbital level, whether I was doing it wrong and it needs something to latch onto I don't know but while I wasn't able to make full use of the Rocktopus, it is impressive to look at, as with the Xeno Titan which... as it's name suggests is like a Titan.Talking of bugs, I have encountered a few but like I said, I do consider Beyond Earth is the state it is currently as of the post date of this review, do be a diamond in the rough so I can excuse these bugs because they don't really take away from the overall enjoyment I get from the game, other people might disagree.The unit models when getting to a level three upgrade for the Soldier, seem to stay around when upgrading a different unit, meaning you'll have two conflicting unit models when upgrading but it does seem to go away or you just stop noticing it.Oh! One thing I will say annoys the hell out of me, is that bloody ADVISR, I'll admit, it is nice to actually have a voice giving you advice and offering you guidance but for the love of all that is sacred in creation, turn it off the moment you can because it will constantly tell you about trades and pointless advise that you've already been told. That is a problem I have with the game but you can turn it off fairly easily so at least it can resolved that way but, I do believe they should patch it so the ADVISR doesn't keep annoying gamers with constant reminders on Trade.Also, the new Tech-Web instead of the traditional Tech-Tree as we are used to, I think is a nice addition and it does add to the atmosphere of the game, you get this sense of, what the hell am I to research which, you will. It is confusing as hell when you first see it but you get the hang of it quickly if you take your time to learn it.Another thing I will say, the Tech-Web incorporates the affinity system into it well, you can research techs that will give you affinity in either Harmony, Purity or Supremacy which basically means Aliens, Humans and Robots.The Tech-Web while designed like a confusing web, actually has some tree like traits, each main Tech on the web is known as a branch and within each branch there is usually one or more additional specialist techs known as leafs, and it is usually these leaf			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This one is different then the other Civilzations I have played. I am not saying that is bad. This one is turn based and works with tiles for units to move. This makes gameplay time consuming. I enjoyed the fact the other faction leaders talk to you, even strike deals with you. The science is mind blowing, even though it takes a lot of time to resurch each new tech.  I didn't play the game much although I already want to buy it.If you like games that make you think that have almost endless options to customise. Then this game is for you! Have fun and hope to see your colony out there one day.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A fresh look at the Civilization formula, with great aspects of the old with lots of new and exciting fetures to distiguish it as a unique game, rather than a parasite on the success of the franchise. it seems lacking at the moment, but it is the same feeling as playing civ 5 without Brave New World, and has just as much potential with future expansions. It comes with a more personal gameplay experience, alowing a degree of cousomization to your army, and quests that shape you future based on your own decisions. This is a game hat deserves to be under the Civilization banner.Rising tide is a step in the right direction, adding more unique aspects, and expanding existing ones. I love ocean cities, hybrid affinities and new units. the game feels more fleshed out now, but it still has ways to go. The update is like gods and kings for Civ 5, it's good, but BNW is around the corner. i would not reomend playing without the expansion, because the base is undeniably lacking.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I genuinly don't know what everyone is talking about. Instead of a horror story follow-up, I am playing a well thought-out game with ability to stand alone. Stop comparing it to Civ V! Leonardo Davinci once said - ""Whence once you have experienced flight, you will spend your whole life looking at the sky"". And it's the same here, with super-awesome-high-definithion graphics. Civ V with expansion packs was The Pinnacle. That's why the recognised they couldn't do a Civ VI. At least one third of reviews on Civ V recommend *only with expansion packs*. Well, guess what? Beyond Earth 'aint got none. So hold your fire guys. How are we suppost to have fanastice, ancient temples as a backround to the Egyptian leader (Civ V) in an alien world?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I still recommend this game for those that are looking for a similar game to Civ V with a sci-fi spin.			",223,87,7,66,18,1,61

												I'm going to be blunt, this is crap. I was expecting some more to this, but its just civ 5 with a space texture pack and a few new things. With all of the things just like this made before it, I would expect this one to be even better, but sadly, its even worse. The whole map is filled with the same things over and over, and maybe its fun for the first play-through, but after the second time, you get bored. Fast. For what this game contains, $50 is overpriced by a lot, $10 is what this game should be valued at. I was expecting something fun that I can enjoy everytime I play it, but this game is not that game.			",54,7,0,13,11,0,3

												I've never written a review until now because I've never felt like making a hard positive or negative recommendation for everybody to read.Do not buy this game, especially if you've played any Civ game in the past. They take out more features than they improve. Firaxis released a half-finished game, they're going to do some patching, then expect us to pay $30 for an ""expansion."" Here's a list of some of the things wrong with the game:-There are only 8 civs.-Unless you have the map pack, there are only 3 map types: pangaea, continents, or archipelago/islands. Fun! The map pack maps aren't very interesting either.-The AI is extremely passive. I have had the AI declare war on me one time in 30 hours. Marbozir, a long-time letsplayer of Civ games, has had it declared on him 3 times in 100 hours. He only plays on the highest difficulty. (The 3rd time happened today in his stream). Even when you ARE in a war with them, they don't really try to invade you like in other Civ games. Even if they have more, stronger units, you can just scare them by spamming a bunch of weak ones. Sometimes they do absolutely nothing even if they could kill you. It is broken.-Each ""Civ"" only has a unique ability now, no more unique units and buildings. They have been replaced by an affinity system that functions independent of your civ choice.-Internal trade routes are stupidly broken and overpowered. The game as a whole screams that it hasn't been balanced and tested well.-Do you want to feel like you're in space? Screw you, all you're getting is a coat of paint. The audio and visuals change, sure. But it's all the same thing. Beyond Earth: Where Everything is the Same as On Earth. The leaders don't even have space-appropriate AI when you interact with them, and they say the SAME STUPID LINES over and over when they offer to trade or whatever. Yes, diplomacy is still broken.-All this was removed: Nukes, religion, the ability to organize trade routes, the diplomacy web (BASIC FOR A 4X GAME), ideology, luxury resources, the world congress, and more have been removed.-There is no reason to interact with the AI because luxury resources and the world congress are gone. Basically the only purpose is to sell resources for money. Diplomacy is extremely boring.-There's no sense of progressing through time anymore because THE WORLD CONGRESS HAS BEEN REMOVED, which was perhaps the most fun part of mid-late Civ 5. Some things are better, but it's clear they're holding features back for money. This is a $50 game and it's not even well-tested, it's extremely buggy and poorly balanced. Please Firaxis, stop trying to squeeze money out of your fanbase. The way to become more profitable is to RELEASE BETTER GAMES, not slapping a coat of paint on an existing one, taking out features, and expecting us to pay $30 for the first expansion, $30 for another, and ONLY THEN it's gonna be as functional as Civ 5 with Brave New World.That's horrible business.

												In its current state it's not worth the asking price if you are already a veteran Civilization player. Beyond Earth has the thin veneer of a Civilization 5 total conversion but without the character or charm typically found in fan-projects. Changes to add player flexibility, such as the affinity system and customizable start, actually diminish the experience by homogenizing... Well... Everything.I'd wait until Firaxis adds additional content, hopefully at a much reduced cost, before investing.			",350,68,12,57,94,3,119

												As much as I would love to reccomend this as it's a great game I simply can't. It feels too much like Civilisation 5 just more confusing. The tech tree is a huge improvement over Civilisation V but along with the affinities feel like the only new things to the series. You may now only play as 8 different civ's which is fine as you can customise them but this means that you can no longer have the large 12+ player games. Another problem is that for the same price you could get Civilisation V + all of the DLC's (Civ V Complete Pack) which is much more completed than this.I played it for about 4 hours when it went out and haven't played it since due to me just not wanting to play it. Which is the opposite of which Civ V made me want to do!Finally, the multiplayer is absolutely godawful, worse than Civilisation V awful. In Civ V you could play multiplayer but it was nowhere near stable and with this I've practically given up on trying to play multiplayer at all. Until Firaxis gets their crap together I will have to say that Civilisation: Beyond Earth is no where near worth the money!tl;dr Civilisation V is better in almost every wayWhat I'd give Civ V: 8/10What I give Beyond Earth: 4/10Thanks for reading.

												Post-DLC update: With Rising Tide, many of the negative issues highlighted below are gone, and there are a lot of new features that make the game an improvement on its own. I no longer add the ""on sale"" disclaimer if you're going to go ahead and get Rising Tide, too.-------Wow, first off, I'm only bothering to add a positive review because I just realized the review rating right now is like 53%! Holy shnikes!I understand, though. Really, after playing Civ 5 with all the DLC, Civ BE is kind of underwhelming. I think the biggest reason it comes short though is because of the limited number of factions. Only 8! If you want to play with more than 8, you either have to mod up (especially a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥for multiplayer or nigh impossible for non-Windows users), or overlap different players with the same ""sponsor."" Yes, the game does make it possible to do this and changes the color for the players using the same team, but, it's kind of a turn off to me to have to keep track of purple Brasil and green Brasil...On the plus side though, and overall I do give this game a thumbs up (when it's on sale!), it does add a number of cool things ..... the Affinity branches and the technology web (that's right web... not tree) come to mind. The way units upgrade across the board as you increase Affinity levels is kind of cool. Being able to pick your upgrade bonuses and even mix Affinity branches up a little bit is kind of cool. Barbarians (aliens) are now much more interesting and can actually change hostility toward individual civs. And purely for flavor, the sci-fi battles and multiple terrain textures (desert / fungal / terran planets) are fun.So, for Civ 5 + DLC fans, Civ BE right now is indeed not worth the big $. You'll miss nukes. You'll miss 20+ unique factions. However, if you enjoy sci-fi flare, it's worth it on sale. Get it for $20 or maybe even $30, depending on your impatience levels. Meh. Poor game deserves better than a 53% rating. Awww.			",127,30,0,31,32,2,40

												My first thought here was to talk about a single playthrough of CIV:BE. The choices, the changes, paths to victory, 'challenges' of the alien worlds, etc etc.Let's not do that. Instead, here are a few key factors that - inevitably - lead me back to playing CIV 5 until BE has a few expansions to bolster its depth.+ Games play faster. I don't mind a 10-20 hour round of CIV5, but it's also being able to finish a round in 3-4 hours.+ Technology is not quite as linear as in CIV5, which serves to add some variety between nations.+ New Mechanic: Satellites, they add some fun new features but would benefit from tougher choices or greater diplomatic drawbacks.+ The Soundtrack. I enjoy it.- Victory objectives lack variety. Aside from Domination they boil down to ""Build Planetary Wonder (occupies a tile) and complete Wonder's unique condition""- Military Upgrades rely on Affinity rank, which forces most tech choices towards increasing your Affinity.- Fewer military units. No bombers, no melee boats, no submarines, no anti-air, no 'airdrop' units.- No Great People.- No World Congress. What, we just abandon the idea of coming together as nations to discuss the future of our planet?- The Leaders (aka Civs) have lackluster bonuses.- There is simply less going on. It feels like a game of solitaire, racing to win in the fewest moves.+/- The presence of aliens and miasma (poison clouds) hinder early game Domination rushes.If you just want a number to judge it by:6.5/10Not a terrible game, but in my opinion there are better 4x games one could play.By Comparison, CIV5 (w/ both Expansions):8.5/10 ",249,71,5,51,37,3,70

												It's hard to pinpoint any single thing that is wrong with this game. It is very similar to Civ V gameplay wise, though not quite as deep. The problem is that the factions are unimaginitve, and they simply don't get you invested in them or the game. Like many people, I was probably comparing this to Alpha Centauri, which was a masterpiece. This pales in comparison. The DLCs help some, but overall it is just a bland experience. I would rather play Civ V or VI, or Endless Legend. Get one of those instead, or find a copy of the original Alpha Centauri.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Really enjoyed this game. Sure its not like Civ V, but I love the Sci-Fi theme. You're able to choose from three different paths that will shape how your civilization plays out and interacts with not just other players but also the environment itself. You really do feel like you're in a strange new planet with some beautiful and strange visuals that make up the planets you're trying to colonize. You have to interact with players and the environment (as stated before) and it adds quite a unique element. The aliens you encounter could be compared to the barbarians of past Civ games, but they act a bit different. You can either kill them off, leave them alone, or tame them, and your actions do have consequences with the aliens and the other factions. All in all, its a great civ game that adds some great new elements, but its not as fleshed out as Civ V is with all its DLC. In time with more updates and DLC this game could be something amazing!

												Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth, you want the short reason as to why I wouldn't recomend it? It feels like a re-skin of Civ 5 with to many of the core features pulled out.The long reason?The aliens are an annoyance, they don't add a fun challange they just zip around eating your units while you can't do anything to defend them. The research is a pain, half the time you've got no clue what it is you're researching. Take the ""transgenics"" research for example, it gives you a gene smelter. Great. Somebody mind telling me what a gene smelter is or what it does before I waste my time on this research? Also the research is a mess, people can end up with aircraft before you have any form of anti-air units that can defend you. basically meaning that your units get bombarded by cities twice. Finally, and most annoyingly is the lack of explanation of how to do anything with the trade routes. I, wrongfully, assumed that as every other unit in the game can embark onto the water the trade convoy could as well. Nope! It's the only type of unit where you've got to build a differnt unit to travel across the sea. So to summarise a ranty review, the reasearch is in a stupid order and you generally have no clue what you're doing, trade routes make no sense and aliens are plain annoying.Are there any good points? Sure, the affinity system is a great addition in my opinoin and the unit upgrades that come from this system are relly cool. That's about it for the good though. Apart from that, lazy re-skin of Civ 5.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game comes across as a very poorly rushed mod rather than a whole new game.The unit volume, variety etc. is gone. The resources are somewhat broke/limiting which makes you think that the devs never really played the game much, and the endings are just shockingly bad.

												This game comes across as a very poorly rushed mod rather than a whole new game.The unit volume, variety etc. is gone. The resources are somewhat broke/limiting which makes you think that the devs never really played the game much, and the endings are just shockingly bad. You accomplish some glorious achievement e.g. contact aliens, enable mind control etc, and what do you get? Some little picture and a few sentences underneath it.

												Well been playing this from the free weekend. I already own Civ 5 and this game really doesn't offer anything different. It really does play as a reskinned game. Should of been an add on to Civ 5 not a stand a lone game. For the price it isn't worth it. Also the GUI is just plain ugly. The new tech tree is a sprawling mess. Maybe at 75% off it might be worth the price, but the games AI is just poor. Instead the game centers on the alien bugs (Barbarians of Civ 5) to add depth.  Also one major nit pick; Since you land your space ship to form your first city why is the map hidden? All the tech to travel the universe but too dumb to scan the planet for at least 1 rotation before landing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game has been on my wishlist since it first came out in October of last year. I'm not a direhard fan of the Civ games, having played Civ IV and Civ V, but I was looking to pick this up, because Civ in space sounded pretty cool. I didn't buy this game right away, because 1) I felt like it was overpriced for what essentially looked liked a Civ V clone, I perhaps would spend $30 on it, but no way was I going to sink $50 into it, and 2) This is Steam, and a new game from a very renowned developer as Firaxis was very likely to go on sale during the winter sale. So the game was released and I waited until Christmas to check it out. I went onto the store page, and noticed that this game got 'mixed' reviews. What? A game with the Sid Meier's Civilization name not getting at least above average reviews? I was skeptical about the reviews, but ultimately decided to hold onto my money. And then, to put the final nail in the coffin, the free weekend rolled around. I could finally try this game out for myself before deciding if I wanted to buy it. I no longer regret my decision to hold onto my money. This game is unfortunately a reskinned Civ V, with pretty much every good feature of it dumbed down. AI personalities are boring, the tech tree was interesting, but confusing and eventually just became a game of ""research the technologies that will get you affinity points"". There was hardly any intro or help when starting the game, aside from choosing your previous Civ exposure. My first, and only, game essentially became a game of finding research to gain affinity, minimal interaction with the AI nations, and waiting out to victory.TL:DR; reskinned, dumbed down Civ V in space. Only buy if you really, really enjoy Civ V and are willing to overlook the many flaws, then maybe for you it will be enjoyable. I personally, however, am glad to remove this game from my wishlist.

												Meh. I was hoping for something....well....more great? It is a bit different than the other civs in the ways there are no real differences between the factions (leaders). The benefits are all picked by you as you pick the game type. There are no real settings for the world anymore besides the size and speed at which you play so that was taken away a bit. The game play seems smooth enough just like most civ games. I give it 3.5/5 Stars. I expected much more with all the hype which is why I don't give it more stars. I hate game makers that hype games just to make a few extra bucks.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's ALOT like Civ 5... but with less civilizations and features. THe big thing is the setting. If this was expanded upon, it would be a great game! Still, I really enjoyed it... it does get super hard though. I would not recommend buying this game at full price. But if you like games like Civ, but like a more sci-fi setting, this will certainly make you happy! Buy it on sale!			",94,9,1,16,11,0,28

												When i played this game the first 2 or 3 times it was really fun but later i already won with every leader. I hope that this game is not finished otherwise i would be sad because there are not much leaders in this game. So thanks to the workshop for extra leaders but they still need to add more leaders. Also this game is very expensive i costs for me €50 i recommend this game in sale.(added when rising tide came out) Now the collection cost €60 FUN getting hyped is not such a good idea i gues i just wanna let ya' know im not going to buy the expansion just wel i dont like that firaxis is pumping money out us the hyping fans i really hope they do a -99% off sale or something though lots of people say the expansion is good well they just need to lower the price.

												A spiritual successor to Alpha Centauri that aims to be different yet familiar to those who had played the venerable Civ-in-space from decades ago. Unfortunately, it falls short of reaching the same excellence of AC let alone surpassing it. Although it has some great graphics (based on the Civ V engine) and uses almost similar mechanics from Civ V, albeit with differences to depict its futuristic setting, the Civ:BE at times feels shallow and seem to lack the depth and engagement of other Civ titles.An expansion entitled Rising Tide is suppose to improve upon the base game and it is hope that the new content will be able to lift the game from mediocre to awesome. Despite its flaws (other reviewers have already pointed them out so I won't repeat it here), Civ:BE still has potential. It is hoped that Firaxis will continue to support the game by releasing more content that not only improves gameplay but also establish it as a standalone but excellent title that inherits AC's DNA without replicating it.In short, it is a recommended purchase for those interested in sci-fi themed colony building sims. However, I would only get it during sales as the current status of the game does not warrant its full price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Probably. But when this is on sale I just considered it buying an expansion for Civ V. Its a good game. It's Civ... in space. I think all the hatred comes from the fact that its just Civ V and not much new. Well why change what was already good? I have enjoyed it so far personally.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm going to be blunt, this is crap. I was expecting some more to this, but its just civ 5 with a space texture pack and a few new things. With all of the things just like this made before it, I would expect this one to be even better, but sadly, its even worse. The whole map is filled with the same things over and over, and maybe its fun for the first play-through, but after the second time, you get bored. Fast. For what this game contains, $50 is overpriced by a lot, $10 is what this game should be valued at. I was expecting something fun that I can enjoy everytime I play it, but this game is not that game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Having played Civ games since its inception. I have to say this one ranks up there with the good ones. The AI is a bit more challanging the Civ 5. I like that. There are only a few minor issues with the game. the first and probably my numer one is that the computer places stations in just the right places for me to not expand efficently.  the other is that I had to use a mod to turn off the timed victory condition. again, these i consider minor issues.

												Played through it twice on marathon now.  You can see all the potential this game has, and I'm sure we'll get the gaps filled in a similar fashion to Civ 5's G&K/BNW expansions.  For now?The wonders you can build are freqently tiny improvements (+1 production, +4 culture!)I can't run this game on my AMD machine.  Same crash I got in Civ 5 Directx 11 mode crashes this game about 10 seconds in to a map.  Yes, the card support DX11.  This game only works with DX 11.  I've had explorers on auto explore kill themselves by pacing back in forth in maisma.  Most of the map was unknown at this point, and the unit simply moved back in forth near a mountain it fancied.UI is missing some of the better features of Civ 5.  This can be worked around, but I miss being able to spend currency on a unit/building without having to go into the city's screen and toggle over to buying, for example.Gone are the interesting factions, and a handful of empty shells with small bonus' have taken their place.  Want to beat a non-harmony loving AI?  Drop a miasma spreading satalite on their head and watch them melt.   All I got for dropping the miasma was a sternly worded chat from their leader.  On hard mode.  There's a satalite to clean it all up too.Give this game some time, and we'll all be looking at hundreds of hours played.  At the moment, Civ 5 is much, much more entertaining.

												I've never written a review until now because I've never felt like making a hard positive or negative recommendation for everybody to read.Do not buy this game, especially if you've played any Civ game in the past. They take out more features than they improve. Firaxis released a half-finished game, they're going to do some patching, then expect us to pay $30 for an ""expansion."" Here's a list of some of the things wrong with the game:-There are only 8 civs.-Unless you have the map pack, there are only 3 map types: pangaea, continents, or archipelago/islands. Fun! The map pack maps aren't very interesting either.-The AI is extremely passive. I have had the AI declare war on me one time in 30 hours. Marbozir, a long-time letsplayer of Civ games, has had it declared on him 3 times in 100 hours. He only plays on the highest difficulty. (The 3rd time happened today in his stream). Even when you ARE in a war with them, they don't really try to invade you like in other Civ games. Even if they have more, stronger units, you can just scare them by spamming a bunch of weak ones. Sometimes they do absolutely nothing even if they could kill you. It is broken.-Each ""Civ"" only has a unique ability now, no more unique units and buildings. They have been replaced by an affinity system that functions independent of your civ choice.-Internal trade routes are stupidly broken and overpowered. The game as a whole screams that it hasn't been balanced and tested well.-Do you want to feel like you're in space? Screw you, all you're getting is a coat of paint. The audio and visuals change, sure. But it's all the same thing. Beyond Earth: Where Everything is the Same as On Earth. The leaders don't even have space-appropriate AI when you interact with them, and they say the SAME STUPID LINES over and over when they offer to trade or whatever. Yes, diplomacy is still broken.-All this was removed: Nukes, religion, the ability to organize trade routes, the diplomacy web (BASIC FOR A 4X GAME), ideology, luxury resources, the world congress, and more have been removed.-There is no reason to interact with the AI because luxury resources and the world congress are gone. Basically the only purpose is to sell resources for money. Diplomacy is extremely boring.-There's no sense of progressing through time anymore because THE WORLD CONGRESS HAS BEEN REMOVED, which was perhaps the most fun part of mid-late Civ 5. Some things are better, but it's clear they're holding features back for money. This is a $50 game and it's not even well-tested, it's extremely buggy and poorly balanced. Please Firaxis, stop trying to squeeze money out of your fanbase. The way to become more profitable is to RELEASE BETTER GAMES, not slapping a coat of paint on an existing one, taking out features, and expecting us to pay $30 for the first expansion, $30 for another, and ONLY THEN it's gonna be as functional as Civ 5 with Brave New World.That's horrible business.

												In its current state it's not worth the asking price if you are already a veteran Civilization player. Beyond Earth has the thin veneer of a Civilization 5 total conversion but without the character or charm typically found in fan-projects. Changes to add player flexibility, such as the affinity system and customizable start, actually diminish the experience by homogenizing... Well... Everything.I'd wait until Firaxis adds additional content, hopefully at a much reduced cost, before investing.			",350,68,12,57,94,3,119

												Review of the game:The game plays a lot like Civ 5; that's not a bad point. It's only natural that a developer will try to build from a previous game when they put a lot of resources into it and in this case, it's not even a bad match. There are, naturally, a lot of differences.The game uses a hex-based stategic map, just like Civ 5, and just like Civ 5, you can only have one military unit and one civillian unint per hex. This avoid the doom stacks that previouse verions of the Civ games suffered from, but in fairness, the amount of military units per hex seems low; having three units or so would make more sense to me -- this will allow you to build stacks which build up a diversity of strengths, without making them entirely invincible.Tech development uses a tech grid or wheel. Each node allows you to branch into new techs as well as open up for sublevel tech -- this is, technically, not at all different from how things have been done since Civ 4. The branching is just less linear, which is.. well, what it is. It makes sense in the context of playing a few decades or even a century of game time, not to have tech which represent major technological breakthroughs in the history of humanity.The game plays a bit on some of the ideas of Alpha Century, but it's not a clone; barbarians have been replaced by aliens and there's some sort of biomass covering a large portion of the planet; unlike in Alpha Century you have very good reason for exterminating the aliens since they will attack your units, even if you try your best to be on their good side and the biomass hurts your units and can kill them.Designable units are not in the game, which I think is a shame, but then again, I never really used it in AC, as it was just too damn time consuming with virtually no benefit. Instead your units can be customized through advancement of ""affinites"".Affinities are very important in the game, as they unlock certain unit upgrades but also give you permanent bonuses and unlock victory conditions; you can't build an emancepation gate without being high developed in the superiority affinity for example. I think this makes sense and fits the game nicely.Religion is (more or less) gone. You can found a new religion by researching the right technlogy and then it's more or less just a flavour thing (I believe it unlocks a victory condition as well).""Complex"" espionage has been added and, well, it's not entirely done IMHO. You get spies, which can be relocated to cities to either do counter-espionage (in your own cities) or do something else in foreign cities, like steal money, technology or outright take over the city. The problem with this is that in order to do anything beyond stealing money, you have to advance the ""intrigue"" level of a city; this is done by perfoming espionage missions in foreign cities, and it's lowered by doing counter espionage. There are also buildings which can permanently lower the maximum intrigue level of a city. This is a big problem, since you, virtually, cannot raise the intrigue level of a foreign city beyond 3. I think I've been able to get it to 4 two or three times, having about 10 spies doing espionage in foreign cities. The intrigue level will drop over time as well, which means you don't even have to use your spies to counter foreign spies, simply because doing any espionage takes too long. Great idea, unbalanced implementation.Overall:I think the game is great but heavily overpriced. I would recommend it if the price was sliced in half, without discounts.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: April 12, 2015
												My interest in this game began when I realized it was a ""spiritual successor"" to Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri.  (Their words, not mine) and I have to say that the result both impresses me and lets me down.On the one hand, it is (mostly) what I would want from a sequel/remake/redux of Alpha Centauri.  Updated graphics, same concept, familiar storylines and turn-based, sci-fi-fun!  I love the addition of the Virtues and Culture along with a better laid out tech tree.On the other hand, the personalities of the factions are stagnant and impossible to really be surprised or developed.  The diplomacy of the previous game is far more limited than before, the alien races are unplayable (and sterile) (however it was not until Alien Crossfire, the expansion that this became an option).  With these fixed parameters, it makes replay value depreciate as each game goes through almost the same motions time and time again.  Also, I miss the victories from the previous game (getting elected to world leader, corning the Energy market, etc).That being said, I still really enjoy the game.  Maybe it is the nostalgia, maybe it is the storyline but I appreciate the challenges each world, starting location, etc can bring.  The bonus is the fact that this game came MOD ready and there already tons of great add-ons that players can add to spice up the game.  As of the time of this review, I have yet to sample any as I'm still enjoying the vanilla version of the game but will find myself adapting it to my preference as time goes on.  Final words?  The gameplay of Beyond Earth is on some levels far better and more interesting than Alpha Centauri ever was and at the same time, simplified and well, vanilla.   As of right now, I do recommend the game, I really do.  It is a lot of fun and there is a bit of a learning curve for players to understand things like Health, Culture, Science, and Energy balance.  My hopes is that there is a shake-up to the factions with more dynamic personalities and increased diplomacy options.  I would happily purchase DLC like that and if they take this down the route of Civilization, we can certainly expect tons of updates and DLC to emerge over time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Civ Beyond Earth or Civ VI as I guess you could call it... what can I say about this game that people haven't said or thought about already? Well... to be honest, I rather enjoy this game and maybe, just maybe. Not for the reasons you the reader think I enjoy this game for... or at least possibly some other reasons which you didn't expect or believe.Let's get the biggest issue out the way first, the Faction Leaders, no matter which way you look at them or analyse them, they will never hold the weight of the previous games historical leader. That was part of the charm of Civ V, you could have Nobunaga Oda, the demon king of Japan go up against Alexander the Great in an epic war. Part of the charm of Civ V was that you could create this entire parallel world where these leaders are all alive round the same time and at each others throats, that was part of what made Civ V great.The Leaders in Beyond Earth will never be able to compete with that, they won't. So don't expect them too, Beyond Earth in my opinion was an experiment, using a new idea and a new setting that is completely different from Civ V.That being said, I do agree that the new Factions are a little bit in-balanced, especially when analysed together. I do like how the cultures and the peoples of Earth have banded together in the future to create these new... almost Mega-Cultures I guess you could say that which to gain control of this new planet... planets depending on which map you pick.One thing I will say about the Factions and the Leaders, is while they will never live up to the weight of the historical leaders of the past, I do believe they hold potential. Here is how I look at Civ Beyond Earth compared to Civ V. I look at Beyond Earth as Civ V was before Gods & Kings and Brave New World. That is how I look at Beyond Earth, I see it as a diamond in the rough that has a massive amount of potential and I pray, I really do pray that Firaxis follow through with this potential and continue to polish Beyond Earth because, it truly does hold a massive amount of potential I would be devastated to see wasted.As a lover of the Civ franchise I read, watched and basically hunted with purpose, everything I could about Beyond Earth before I purchased it only 2 days ago. I currently as of this review have 25 hours logged on Steam playing Beyond Earth compared to my 239 hours logged for Civ V.So, you could claim that this review isn't valid if you don't believe I have spent enough time playing the game to give a fair opinion and review, fair enough but I am giving it anyway. Recently I saw one of my favourite YouTubers give a review on the game, AngryJoe. He said and I quote ""Beyond Earth feels like an incredible opportunity wasted."" I do not agree with that, I agree the game doesn't live up to the expectations that were presented for it then again, we are talking about a Civ game, possibly the best strategy game franchise ever, in my opinion. I don't know, maybe Total War is better I have yet to play a Total War game but I plan on getting Shogun 2 which seems to be the best choice.Back to the point, I do not believe the game is an opportunity wasted, I believe it is a diamond in the rough that with the proper care and love and grow to become something close to Civ V, I doubt it will ever beat Civ V mostly due to the weight the historical leaders brought, but it has a fighting chance of being close. However, you must remember, Civ V has G&K and BNW whereas Beyond Earth has nothing so far, which, is why I look at the current state of Beyond Earth as of the post date of this review as Civ V was before G&K and BNW enhanced the experience and made it something truly amazing.I feel I have ranted on a little more than I should of about the comparison between this game and it's older brother Civ V but it was a point I felt I had to explain my own opinion for.Let's move on before this review goes on for longer than it should. I've heard Rythian of the Yogscast another of my favourite YouTubers talk about the graphics of the game, how they look dirty and muddy. Honestly, I cannot tell as I haven't played the game on High or higher graphics, I play on Medium level as I use my laptop and the game runs perfectly so I may try a higher setting so I can look at it in full detail and have a better opinion. However, I agree and disagree with the comments they made, about the graphics.I agree they do look dirty and muddy, they definitely have a darker colour palate for some terrains and a brighter one for others. These are enhanced through Mods which are easily integrated with the game through the Steam Workshop and if you play with the Distinctive Terrains mods, you will see more detailed terrains so I do recommend playing with those Mods just for the visual effect.As for the graphics for the units and the cities, I honestly am not too sure. I feel they suit the purpose enough, they suit their purpose enough. I don't know, maybe as polish is added to the game as I believe it will, this is Firaxis we are talking about, as more polish is added to the game they may upgrade the textures to make them more pleasing or eye catching but for the most part they are descent enough.Hmm... what else is there for me to talk about... I seemed to have focused a lot on what other people were saying about the game and what I believed so I am a little stick... bear with me a moment here. Okay, the Aliens, something you will be seeing a lot in Beyond Earth.Personally, I believe these Aliens are done well and they are impressive to look at, especially some of the unique Harmony units like the Rocktopus and the Xeno Titan. However, the only game in which I got the Rocktopus it seemed to be bugged and wasn't able to move to the orbital level, whether I was doing it wrong and it needs something to latch onto I don't know but while I wasn't able to make full use of the Rocktopus, it is impressive to look at, as with the Xeno Titan which... as it's name suggests is like a Titan.Talking of bugs, I have encountered a few but like I said, I do consider Beyond Earth is the state it is currently as of the post date of this review, do be a diamond in the rough so I can excuse these bugs because they don't really take away from the overall enjoyment I get from the game, other people might disagree.The unit models when getting to a level three upgrade for the Soldier, seem to stay around when upgrading a different unit, meaning you'll have two conflicting unit models when upgrading but it does seem to go away or you just stop noticing it.Oh! One thing I will say annoys the hell out of me, is that bloody ADVISR, I'll admit, it is nice to actually have a voice giving you advice and offering you guidance but for the love of all that is sacred in creation, turn it off the moment you can because it will constantly tell you about trades and pointless advise that you've already been told. That is a problem I have with the game but you can turn it off fairly easily so at least it can resolved that way but, I do believe they should patch it so the ADVISR doesn't keep annoying gamers with constant reminders on Trade.Also, the new Tech-Web instead of the traditional Tech-Tree as we are used to, I think is a nice addition and it does add to the atmosphere of the game, you get this sense of, what the hell am I to research which, you will. It is confusing as hell when you first see it but you get the hang of it quickly if you take your time to learn it.Another thing I will say, the Tech-Web incorporates the affinity system into it well, you can research techs that will give you affinity in either Harmony, Purity or Supremacy which basically means Aliens, Humans and Robots.The Tech-Web while designed like a confusing web, actually has some tree like traits, each main Tech on the web is known as a branch and within each branch there is usually one or more additional specialist techs known as leafs, and it is usually these leaf			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This one is different then the other Civilzations I have played. I am not saying that is bad. This one is turn based and works with tiles for units to move. This makes gameplay time consuming. I enjoyed the fact the other faction leaders talk to you, even strike deals with you. The science is mind blowing, even though it takes a lot of time to resurch each new tech.  I didn't play the game much although I already want to buy it.If you like games that make you think that have almost endless options to customise. Then this game is for you! Have fun and hope to see your colony out there one day.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A fresh look at the Civilization formula, with great aspects of the old with lots of new and exciting fetures to distiguish it as a unique game, rather than a parasite on the success of the franchise. it seems lacking at the moment, but it is the same feeling as playing civ 5 without Brave New World, and has just as much potential with future expansions. It comes with a more personal gameplay experience, alowing a degree of cousomization to your army, and quests that shape you future based on your own decisions. This is a game hat deserves to be under the Civilization banner.Rising tide is a step in the right direction, adding more unique aspects, and expanding existing ones. I love ocean cities, hybrid affinities and new units. the game feels more fleshed out now, but it still has ways to go. The update is like gods and kings for Civ 5, it's good, but BNW is around the corner. i would not reomend playing without the expansion, because the base is undeniably lacking.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I genuinly don't know what everyone is talking about. Instead of a horror story follow-up, I am playing a well thought-out game with ability to stand alone. Stop comparing it to Civ V! Leonardo Davinci once said - ""Whence once you have experienced flight, you will spend your whole life looking at the sky"". And it's the same here, with super-awesome-high-definithion graphics. Civ V with expansion packs was The Pinnacle. That's why the recognised they couldn't do a Civ VI. At least one third of reviews on Civ V recommend *only with expansion packs*. Well, guess what? Beyond Earth 'aint got none. So hold your fire guys. How are we suppost to have fanastice, ancient temples as a backround to the Egyptian leader (Civ V) in an alien world?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I still recommend this game for those that are looking for a similar game to Civ V with a sci-fi spin.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Tried it over the free weekend. Civ Lite is how I've seen it describe, and that's correct. How you traverse the tech web depends on what victory you are going for. The aliens, barbs, are OP early in the game, an annoyance mid- and late game, and killing them will earn you enemies. The wonders are underwhelming. Traversing the tech web doesn't really feel like you are making technological advancements...it just unlocks buildings and affinity. The UI is a bad combination of hard to read and built for moblie.This game reminds me of a time waster I play on my phone, not the deep Civ game I sit down to marathon.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really, really wanted to like this.However, I was no great fan of Civ V, and this is, when all is said and done, just a reskin of Civ V with a few bits and bobbles added. So ultimately: If you enjoyed Civ V, you'll probably enjoy the gameplay here. If you didn't like Civ V, nothing is improved here whatsoever.When Civ IV did a total conversion with a few new mechanics, new graphics, but ultimately the same engine underneath  -- with ""Final Frontier"" and ""Fall From Heaven: Age of Ice"", both tucked away as part of the mods for Beyond the Sword -- it was just an added part of an expansion pack that gave you more in Civ IV itself.With Beyond Earth, I'm expected to pay the price of a new game for it, and I cannot deny I am disappointed in what it adds, and more importantly, where it fails to live up to its spiritual predecessor, Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri.The Virtues system seems like it could've done so much more, but instead it's just power-ups with no tradeoffs. The Affinities are clever, but ultimately fail to end up truly drawing you in. (A tiny suggestion there: it would've been nice to see your own leader as he or she is transformed by their affinity, just as much as it was interesting to see the other leaders transformed!)A bizarrely minor gripe: the tech descriptions are all read by one voice; even though they are frequently attributed to the leaders, who are voice acted. Why not pay the VAs a bit more and get them to read those things? (Heck, could we have had the voice actors actually read the lines for their dialogue in the diplomacy screens? Nah, not that either.) It would have done a great deal, as with Alpha Centauri, to help make the leaders seem more alive. CEO Fielding isn't even in the same ballpark as CEO Nwabudike Morgan.  These leaders didn't feel like actual characters, and I managed to get through an entire playthrough without a single one of them declaring war against me, despite numerous threats.In summary: I wanted to love it. I don't. I can't recommend it at the price it's at.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My first ever review...and sadly a negative one. I have been a CIV fan since the first game, which btw was the first PC game I ever bought, somewhere in the 90's. From CIV to CIV 5 I completed 1 game every 10 or 20 because I loved the early game stages...the exploration...the early choices...the first encounters. Then you had to decide which civs to befriend, which to attack, how to specialize your cities, etc.. By the modern age it was clear who was going to win so there I go to a new game, with a different civ and a smile in my face.I don't know exactly what is the issue with BE but I could not endure more than 4 hrs in the first game and maybe 2 in the second. The tech web is confusing and it is not clear where I am going, the world is colorful yet dull, and I am not sure I am making meaningful choices throughout the game. Everything seems sooooo boring...Not to mention a very annoying bug which prevents me from playing at low res (1,280 x 720).Maybe I didn't try long enough but it was the first CIV game I gave up so early, and I played every single one of them. I sure hope Firaxis didn't lose its touch.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Really enjoyed this game. Sure its not like Civ V, but I love the Sci-Fi theme. You're able to choose from three different paths that will shape how your civilization plays out and interacts with not just other players but also the environment itself. You really do feel like you're in a strange new planet with some beautiful and strange visuals that make up the planets you're trying to colonize. You have to interact with players and the environment (as stated before) and it adds quite a unique element. The aliens you encounter could be compared to the barbarians of past Civ games, but they act a bit different. You can either kill them off, leave them alone, or tame them, and your actions do have consequences with the aliens and the other factions. All in all, its a great civ game that adds some great new elements, but its not as fleshed out as Civ V is with all its DLC. In time with more updates and DLC this game could be something amazing!

												Having played several Sid Meier's games, such as Locomotion and some among the Civ series, this feels right at home. Although it is outshown by it's predacessor (V) in many aspects, it feels like very much like a civ game. The web tech system is very much welcomed, giving you a different game every time you play. It feels quicker than V, with great manuverability of units and impactal buildings coming within one or two hours of playing, rather than halfway through the game. The affinity system is unique to me, as a direct focus towards that gives the advantages one would expect later game. Downsides include factions with reduced character, a shorter games in comparison to Siv as a series. Overall, I have had a wonderful time playing this game, and will be occasionally playing it on and off.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												To be honest I belive this game to have been in the vein of it's predecesor vanilla Civ V. It took a few things from brave new world such as the Ideology and trade route systems, but left out some of the other neat features that the DLC offered. The civilepedia was full of interesting story and information about each tech and improvement but was not as interesting as the flavor provided by Sid Miers Alpha Centari. Really that is what it boils down to whith Beyond Earth, when looking foward to this game I was looking forward to Alpha Centari whith Civ V mechanics in a way thats what I got and I honestly enjoyed it despite its flaws and I look forward to Brave New World Quality DlC to Fix and Improve this great game.

Just avoid the ai altogether unless your wipeing them out.Annoying aliens always getting in your way and the siege worms are beyond irritating.Bland environment gone are the deserts, rivers, mountains and snow plains all replaced by ONE type of terrain that you have to choose from.Tech web is crap you will get to all the most powerful techs in under 200 turns making the game way more quicker than usual. Gone is the iconic tech tree and having to research certain techs to get others. This time you pretty much pick a tech and it goes to it in a straight line.The affinity levels are terrible all your units automatically get upgraded FREE of charge as soon as you research the next level. The ai will do this very quickly and than lord over you very fast!So the wrap up: dumb Ai, terrible trade system, annoying aliens, QUICK GAMES and bland maps.THIS IS THE WORST CIV YET!!

												I have 300 hours in Civ 5. Well over a thousand hours in Civ 4. Beyond Earth:-Lacks personality. The leaders are identical and picking one or the other makes no difference to how you play.-Lacks play styles. Everything boils down to ""build to a building.""-Lacks anything to do. Every map feels empty and barren, like an alien world oddly enough. There's no land grab or conflict, you just casually spread out. Fighting aliens isn't difficult.-Lacks direction. I played 4-5 games, all of which took less than three hours to complete (unheard of in a Civ game) and it didn't seem like there was one thing they wanted me to focus on. I was just making buildings willy-nilly. Maybe 4-5 military units when needed, and I glided to victory. What was the sci-fi setting servicing?I just asked myself: Why did they make this game? I don't think they really know.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's got mixed reviews but I'm a huge Sid Meier fan and I do enjoy this game although, I finished one entire 'epic' campaign without ever getting involved in any sort of combat or conflict with other colonists.  It was a very easy play through.  The old Alpha Centauri series is better but Beyond Earth is fun in my opinion. If you've never played the old series, then just think of it as one of the recent Civ games set on a planet with futuristic techs to research instead of advancing through the ages on Earth. It could have been better but maybe the new expansion pack will improve it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I liked Beyond Earth a lot. I dont know if I can say I liked it more than the other main CIV games, mainly because I did not get to play it nearly long enough to make that distinction. I wanted to play it more but did not get time over the free weekend. I can say though that the atmosphere of the game, and the setting reminded me a lot of Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri. I would probably recommend Beyond Earth if I had gotten to play it more, so there is that. I hope to get time to play more of Beyond Earth in the future.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Normal gripe with Civilization games for me is that you usually need the DLCs to either fix or make the game playable, and this one is no exception. Only thing I can really give them credit for is having a demo.Only thing memorable from my playthrough was the very beginning when you ""accidentally"" pi*s off the aliens and get swarmed by them. I had this outpost with 5 marines and a sniper squad. A bunch of alien nests respawned around them (yeah you fight to kill the nests and they just respawn). they quickly got surround by aliens and were decimated. By the time I got reinforcements there only the snipers remained.Aside from the aliens theres not much else done new. There new vinity system (sorry for misspell) has you choose one of three specializations: Supremecy, Harmony, and Purity. Nothing really interesting about this. all it really does is make it which unit you have late game is specific to your vinity. Yes there are bonuses, but you can have levels in different vinities.They messed up the unit level up too. Now, when one of your units level up, you can either heal them or increase damage. Nothing else. Instead they moved it to the new specialization system. Instead, you level up your units as a whole, giving the upgrade to everyone. you can upgrade when you reach certain vinity levels. All this suceeds in doing is making your units simple clones. there aren't unique in any way.Diplomacy sytem is completely messed up. no personality at all.As far as sci-fi goes, there really isn't any except for the aliens. There are orbital units, but they just provide buffs and crash back down to the surface after a while. Yep you have to build a completely new one.Honestly, there really is alot more stuff I should mention, but I simply can't be bothered to. Instead Im going to go place Galactic Civilzations. Or maybe Endless Space. go play those instead.			",81,17,0,14,13,0,34

												Beyond Earth vanilla feels like an unfinished game. It's basically Civ 5 but with a futuristic make over with a few changes. I feel like it's gonna be like Civ 5, when it got released it was bland and boring and it took a few great DLC's that were developed over the course of a few months and years to make it a great game. CIVBE has a lot of potential and even with the new DLC which makes the game much more enjoyable it still has it's issues. VANILLA:The Good:Aliens/Barbarians: The aliens in this game is much more intelligent then the barbarians in previous games, they don't go on blatant suicidal attemps to ♥♥♥♥ with you and waste your time. For the most part they leave you alone unless you get close to their nest or if you have killed a bunch of them. They also play more of a crucial part depending on what path you go down.Affinities: Is a really awesome system. Basically the tech you research gives you EXP towards a certain affinity which is like an ideology. Once you level up in a certain affinity you can level up your units which will give them a cool design and stats based off of what affinity you went down. Like if you main in Supremacy you get to build giant siege robots and have robotic looking boats it's pretty cool. It's better then everyone having the same unit just with different colour pants. Tech Web: It takes a bit to understand, but it lets for more personalization towards what kind of game you are looking for. In old civ games you would pretty much research everything but in CIVBE you have a giant web to choose tech from which is really cool, you aren't forced down a certain path.Ways to win: There are much more ways to win now. Each affinity has it's own way of winning if you either want to take over Old Earth, or save the people of Old Earth or have sex with a bunch of aliens. There are also much other ways of winning like making contact with intelligent aliens or domination stuff like that.Spies: Are really much better then previous games, you can send them on certain tasks. So instead of sending them to steal tech, you can send them to steal gold, research points, and recruit deserters. So depending on the situation you can send spies out to help you.The Bad:Leaders: have no charisma and aren't interesting in the slightest, whenever you talk to them they all have the same blank expression. In other Civ games when you talked to leaders you would be warped to their environment, it being a castle, boat, sacrifice chamber, or deep in the forrest it was really cool, with the new leaders the background is just transparent and bit fuzzy which helps strips the leaders of any charisma. All the resources, buildings and wonders: In other civ games when you build a libary you know what a libary is going to do, but in CIVBE when you're researching something you don't always know what a certain building can do just by looking at it so when you have an entire tech web staring you in the face it can be hard to figure out what you want by just looking at it. Same things go for wonders and resources, in other Civ games you know what iron does and what you can build with it, but in CIVBE when you have Xenomass you are probably gonna be confused for what it's utility will be until you need it to build a unit.Affinities: Even though affinities are pretty awesome they still can get annoying because you need to focus in on one affinity and if you don't you will be left in the dust.Just the game in general: Is pretty bland and can get boring very fast.RISING TIDE:The Good:Diplomacy: They COMPELTELY revamped diplomacy. Now you get diplomacy points which you can get from doing certain tasks and you can spend them on getting leadership traits that give your civ abilitys, you can also spend the points on other peoples traits, if they accept the deal which is pretty cool. It is much easier to become friends with Civ's now. CIVs have a respect and fear counter which basically means the more they respect you and like you the ""respect"" points will go up for that CIV and they are more likely to make deals with you and accept to be allies, instead of completely sucking a CIV's♥♥♥♥♥to be their ally you can spend diplomatic points on becoming their ally or trade partners if they accept of course. Fear is basically like it sounds like the more they are scared of your tech and military and the more conflicts you have with them the more ""fear"" will go up, the higher it is the more likely a civ will declare war on you.Building Civ's on ocean tiles: Is pretty awesome, no longer are you confined to a tiny continent or island you can build small cities on ocean tiles and if you want move the city to a better spot. They are completely op tho, they don't generate culture and they don't expand much unless you but the tiles.Hybrid Affinities: Are what affinities needed to make them more fun to use. It's what it sounds like you can make a hybrid of two affinities with their own special units, make for more fun customizable units. Declaring War: Now instead of having civs being completely anal and not giving you anything even though it's clear you whopped their♥♥♥♥♥now depending on how much a civ kicked an other civs♥♥♥♥♥they will be forced to give you stuff.The Bad: Diplomacy: Because of the ""Respect"" and ""Fear"" points taking stage you no longer can actually make choices and talk to a civ or call them out you can only change your relationship with them. Also ""Fear"" needs some more work done with it. If you've gone to war with a civ and completely decimated them their ""Fear"" for you will be pretty large, this will compel them to goto war with you at random times even though they are not prepared in the slightest to attack you. I've had civ's just randomly declare war on me three times with only one or two units to attack.Trading: You can no longer directly trade rescources with other leaders which is absurd, the only way to gain or get rid of rescources is to set up a black market with your spy, but it costs 50 diplomacy points per turn WHICH IS A ♥♥♥♥ING CRAZY AMOUNT. So far I'm lucky to get around 40 late game. I think they should just bring back trading normally.Declaring War: I feel like this system is so close to being awesome but it falls short. See, you don't get a choice in what you want a civ will just give you what they calculated to be fair which is good sometimes and annoying other times. Because sometimes they will give you a trash city they just made which is a half the planet away and you have no choice but to take it because you probably don't want to continue the war. Alliances: Can get VERY annoying VERY quickly. Because if you are allied with someone they will pull you into a war that you have no interest in, even if they started it. One day you will be making nice, nice with everyone then you ally warmongering mc♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ will declare war and will ♥♥♥♥ everything you worked towards over.Conclusion:All in all, even though this game has it's failures I feel like it has a lot of potential and most of my problems with this game will be fixed with updates and DLC's, for example the rising tide dlc fixed a lot of my gremacies with the vanilla version. With Rising Tide I have a lot of fun with it but I feel like it will lose it's magic soon.  I would recommend buying this game and it's DLC on a good sale if you are looking to play a new interesting game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is lightyears better than civ 5. (yes, without rising tide!)Why?Every decision counts! In civ 5, early game doesn't really matter, more or less. Expand, kill some bar-bars, make alliances. By mid to late game the decisions you made in the entire first half don't really matter at all. In BE, every decision counts. You start towards your choosen affinity from turn one. What affinity to choose largerly depends on your surroundings (resources, abundance of aliens, etc...), and from there, you can beeline for specific techonologies. All this means that every turn matters, which I would not say of the first ~1/3 of civ 5.Research Net: Only go for tech you need. That simple. This means that every civ in game is very different from eachother, which changes up the fighting a lot.Combat: There are fewer military units, even when you are around halfway through the game you may only have 2-3 good specialized units. Combat is much more fun because you are fighting against units different that your own and how you fight depends a lot on what affinity and units you have. Rather than knowing what side will win from the beginning, based on who has slightly more advanced units (civ 5) its hard to tell what units each side will have and who will win. Combat is interesting every time. Orbital units add a entirely new element to combat as well.AI: The AI in this game are simply better than the AI in 5. AI in BE will ambush you with a full army that can sweep cities in a turn, as opposed to the AI in 5 which will try throwing a few units at you now and again in pathetic attempts to wear you down. The only thing that irritates me still about this game is that diplomacy is a little messed up. I hear this is fixed in rising tide. But, it's no worse than the diplomacy in 5. In short, this review is so long because I felt everyone was really wrong about how awesome this game is.			",22,13,0,1,3,0,5

												This apple doesn't entirely fall far enough away from the tree as it ought to (though the expansion helps in my opinion quite a bit), but I still enjoyed it and put a fair amount of time in. Though its confusing at first, it does end up breeding an alien and new experience. I think alot of people were hoping to have something more like Alpha Centauri, and that'd be great, but this one doesn't lack all that much for not being Alpha Centauri really. Ask me again and I'd buy it again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was hoping for Alpha Centauri 2.0.  I got Civ 5 with a new skin.... Definitely not worth the full price.Do you remember Alpha Centari?  Do you remember the Datalinks with all it's cutting edge information on technology?  Do you remember the secret project videos, with insightful commentary from the leaders, or quotes from Aristotle's Nichomachean Ethics or Sun Tzu's Art of War?  Do you remember the brief videos when you finally cornered and defeated the leader of a rival faction? How about how you could terraform and change the landscape to your liking?  Do you remember how you could customize your troops from top to bottom with weapons, armor and special abilities?  Do you remember how you could create floating cities, if you wished?Well, Beyond Earth has nothing like that.  The biggest innovation, which I am not even sure is a plus is the technology web.  Instead of it branching off, you work your way from the middle to the edges of the web, and and each main technology has a few sub technologies.  I found myself just researching as many technologies with the particular affinity I had chosen, because that is the way you upgrade your troops in this game.  You focus on one affinity, then as you acquire more technologies that are in line with that affinity, you get to upgrade your troops, and pick one out of two  attributes.  The terrain is quite interesting, and I still do not know what all the resources I can get are, or what they do.  But some are required to produce certain buildings and others for certain troops, kind of like marble or stone is to buildings and horses and iron for troops in Civilization games.Most aliens you encounter are quite weak.  They are merely the Beyond earth counterparts of barbarians and do little to hinder your exploration, unless you run into an aggressive Siege worm on land, or an aggressive Kraken at sea.  The Aliens get relatively weaker and eventually disappear once you and your fellow humans have settled most of the planet.You get quests througout the game, but they seem a bit forced and do not add much to the game.  Most of them consist of picking an extra attribute to a building you just finished.   There are others that compel you to research a certain technology and explore a bit.  But even that is very superficial.Diplomacy is the standard stuff, but actually leaves a lot off the table if you do not have a cooperation agreement.  You can give away stuff in exchange for favors, so that the other faction ""owes you one"", but these favors are usually not worth much.  Oh, you need an ally because half of the leaders declared war on you?  Well, guess how much those favors are worth.  Pretty much nothing.  They don't bring people to fight a defensive war on your side.  If your enemy is the one who owes you favors, they can't be traded for temporary peace.  No, you will get a measly revenue stream much less valuable than what you gave up.The leaders are uninspiring and generic, presumably because at first they should be blank canvases ready to get affinity all over them.  Either way, not much to these guys.  Nothing unique, nothing that sets them apart.The game is entertaining enough, but not worth the full price.  Especially if you already are playing Civ 5.  This is basically the same game with aliens			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Took advantage of the free weekend to give this a try since I was eyeing it before it even came out, but was put off by the negative reviews. Short version: I'm glad I did. The game as it is feels incomplete and the UI is incredibly hard to navigate. I took advantage of some mods in the Workship right away to compensate, but still... the game as it is did not impress.I really wanted it to be like Alpha Centauri. It's not. It's unpolished and needs a lot more features before it can feel like a full game. Some of my units were lacking complete attack animations for crying out loud. The factions have no personality, either.Go play Alpha Centauri or Civ 5 instead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you thought this was a successor of Alpha Centauri, well; You were wrong!This is basically Civ 5, space age. Concidering the cost of the game, 50euros, I would expect this game to be unique or have lots of new functions.But all in all this is Civ 5 with space age addon.Aliens = Barbarians. Diplomacy is still the same old rubbish.Factions does not have the ""personality"" as adverts said. Science tree is just made into a round circle with clusters.Actually found this game awfully boring. And I do not find it worth the money.

												I have 300 hours in Civ 5. Well over a thousand hours in Civ 4. Beyond Earth:-Lacks personality. The leaders are identical and picking one or the other makes no difference to how you play.-Lacks play styles. Everything boils down to ""build to a building.""-Lacks anything to do. Every map feels empty and barren, like an alien world oddly enough. There's no land grab or conflict, you just casually spread out. Fighting aliens isn't difficult.-Lacks direction. I played 4-5 games, all of which took less than three hours to complete (unheard of in a Civ game) and it didn't seem like there was one thing they wanted me to focus on. I was just making buildings willy-nilly. Maybe 4-5 military units when needed, and I glided to victory. What was the sci-fi setting servicing?I just asked myself: Why did they make this game? I don't think they really know.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Beyond Earth is a decent CIV5 spinoff, but suffers from a lot of balance issues and design problems. It also fails spectacularly at the idea of being the spiritual sucessor of Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri (SMAC). The game has a lot of interesting ideas, but fails to implement them in a balanced and meaningful way. The Tech Web is interesting in theory, but does not work well in conjunction with the Affinity system. After a few games you will find yourself using the same early game tech path over and over again - and during the late game you will ignore most other techs and just focus on those that grant you points for your preferred affinity, regardless of the actual tech benefits. The tech web ultimately fails to promote player choise and, once more, locks him into first-order tech strategies.The Orbital Layer is another mechanic that has potential, but there is little incentive to use it. Even the highest difficulty levels can be won without ever launching a satellite. Interaction is limited to button pressing to shoot down other satellites with cities or artillery units.The victory conditions for the Affinites sound interesting in theory, but in practice they just boil down to clicking ""NEXT TURN"" once you have setup up the prerequisites. Purity also requires the player to manually summon a unit each turn and guide it to a settle location, while Supremacy needs to send military units back to earth - again one unit at a turn. This turns the last stage into tedious micromanagement, boring the player instead of hyping him up for the victory.The aliens in Beyond Earth are another interesting idea, but feel quite passive. Unlike barbarians in CIV5 they will never pillage improvements (except for random siege worm movement) and never attack workers or cities unless the player provokes them. While aliens present a challenge during the early game, they fail to scale past that phase and become utterly pointless during the mid and late game. Even the first unit upgrade is enough to tilt the balance in favor of the player - and once you have the first Affinity related unit you can one-shot every alien unit but the (rare) siege worm. To add insult to injury, the game offers an early game building that prevents aliens from getting close to your cities - and this building also has a secondary ability to grant alien immunity to all your trade routes.Stations are the successors of city states from CIV5, but are less interactive and more often than not less useful than other trade route options. They also have the annoying tendency to drop down in your primary expansion areas, blocking large chunks of the map for your settlers unless the disappear from having no trade or you forcefully remove them - which requires early military investment, a quite bad strategy.Lore-wise the game has actually a lot of interesting details, but it utterly fails to present them to the player. The only way you will have access to the lore is reading the (not very eye friendly designed) CIVpedia. AI leaders only have two main lines in the diplomacy screen that they will repeat over and over again. The techs feature quotes from different leaders, but fail to grasp the depth of the quotes from SMAC. In addition to that, all voicework for techs and wonders is done by a single voiceactor, so they feel even more bland. All of these issues combined give the game a lifeless and uninspired tone.Many useful features from CIV5 are gone. You can no longer continue playing after being defeated by the AI, there is no strategic view and the game provides no direct post-game info. The UI design is pretty bad and in some cases hides important information from the player (like quest rewards). The aesthetic design is not very pleasing. Pale colors make it hard to read the map, more often then not you will have trouble to see if a tile has Miasma on it unless you zoom in quite a bit. Borders can be barely visible and different terrain types look confusingly similiar.Apart from these huge design issues the game suffers from severe balance problems. To name the biggest ones:- The health system is mostly pointless. You can drop deep into negative without suffering any significant consequences. You can only stay positive by selecting the Prosperity virtues.- Trade routes are so powerful that they dwarf all other options in the game. They also require manual adjustment every 25 turns - which is more than annoying, because you will have 3 trade routes per city.- These two problems combined make ICS (Infinite City Sprawl) the best strategy in the game: Just place as many cities as you can and you will have an advantage over your enemy. Disregard the terrain to search for a good spot - just place them at minimum distance.- Unit balance is terrible. Tier I affinity units dominate everything and as your unit upgrades progress some units fail to fulfill their specified roles - for example, gunners are better at sieges than artillery units during certain affinity levels.- The AI is utterly incompetent, even worse than in CIV5. I have been able to win on the highest difficulty level in my 3rd game - and I rarely played past medium to high difficulty in CIV5.- Only a handful of wonders are actually useful. Most of them are simply not worth an invest of science and production ressources.- Diplomacy is pointless. There is no need to ever trade with the AI unless you desperately need a certain strategic ressource. Deals offered by the AI are extremely one sided, so you have no reason to ever  accept one.Now this is an impressive list of shortcomings, but I would like to remind you that CIV:BE has to go up against the well polished CIV5 and the stellar SMAC. The game itself is not a complete failure, but compared to these two other titles it is lacking in many areas. Until the problems with balancing and basic design issues have been resolved, I sadly cannot recommend this title for full price. If CIV:BE  goes on sale for 25 bucks you may consider getting it if you liked CIV5. Overall I'd advise you to buy and play the original SMAC - if you can bear its 15 year old graphics and the horrible UI. You will get a great game with interesting game mechanics, better immersion and a more interesting story - at a much lower price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Played for a good hour during the free weekend.Liked the graphics and theme.Was indifferent about the research web. It didn't make the game more interesting, only slightly less straightforward.Didn't like that most of the gameplay felt like Civ V without the DLC.Hated that I encountered a game breaking bug. (Buttons in diplomacy screens did not register at all. I effectively could not conduct diplomacy in my game.)I see no reason to continue playing. Civ V + DLC and Alpha Centauri scratch the same itch much better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When Beyond Earth came out it was the lamest Civ to have ever come out. As someone who is a giant fan of anything space or sci-fi themed I was really disappointed with how bad the game felt and how much better Civ V was (still is). But I kept waiting and hoping that the expansion would be fun. And here we are, Rising Tide is out. And although many things are illogical (peace terms) the game is DEFINITELY more fun. It just feels better now. It's definitely different from Civ V; it's own game. It's also, however, still not as good as Civ V with both DLCs. I'm hopeful that it gets even better with the next expansion.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So with the newly released DLC ""Rising Tide"", Civ: Beyond Earth has taken a giant leap forward. This DLC has made possible to build cities in the oceans and revamped/added military units. Plus they have overhauled the Diplomacy between nations, as well as updating and changing some of the personal traits for your nations leader. Not to mention the addition of four new nations.Sid Meier's Civilization®: Beyond Earth™ has finally started to look and feel like Civ: 5 does with all of its DLCs. Please, if you gave up on this game after purchase, try it again with the new DLC. It is well worth it. If you never planned to buy it because of what people said about the original game, stop listening to them and pick it up the next time you can.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Every time you play the game it feel like the same game regardless of configuration. Low unit diversety, no faction unique units and the tech tree in a confusing nightmare. After about 100 hours of play im totally burnt out on this one. Compated to civ 5 where I have logged thousands of hours over the years and it still is fun, this game is really missing replayability.

												I wanted so much to love this game. I have been playing the Civilization series since the first one came out. I have loved the spin offs like Colonization and Alpha Centauri. Reading a lot of the negative reviews for this latest offering, I decided to hold off on buying this until a price drop. The recent free weekend gave me the opportunity to try this game in full.Sadly the nay sayers were right. It is a good game, but it feels more like a Civ 5 Expansion than a full new game.Pros:- New tech tree format- Affinity is a nice ideaCons:-Same clunky AI- Game pacing on anything longer than standard was far too drawn out (I usually play Civ on Epic, but this was way too slow)- Lack of unit optionsOverall, if you love Civ, you will enjoy. But do NOT pay full price for this. ",9,0,0,12,10,4,23

												From what I've played, seems worth it for $30 if you're a huge fan of 4X games and you're burnt out on Civ V. But if you aren't burnt out on Civ V, I'd go for the Civ V complete edition instead. Civ V: BNW has more features than BE and is better polished. It also has a better multiplayer scene and better replayability.I personally won't be buying the game from what I've experienced in my half-playthrough. I think the game needs a few expansions before it's worth playing over Civ V BNW.A few things I do like about BE:(A) Aliens replacing Barbarians. They're much more aggressive and dangerous than Civ V barbarians, and they add a lot of gameplay depth in conjunction with the Harmony affinity.(B) Affinities. They're great.(C) Orbital units.(D) Upgrading base military units.Things I dislike:(A) The victory conditions. They're similar to the Mass Effect 3 ending -- exactly the same, but different colors/flavors.(B) Air units. I expected them to be overhauled, but they are exactly the same as the air units in Civ V -- clunky and not very useful.(C) No full zoom-out like in Civ IV... I want to see the whole planet, since I'm playing a sci fi themed Civ.(D) Nations are not distinct enough.(E) AI is♥♥♥♥♥♥awful.My recommendation: Unless you're burnt out on Civ V: BNW, wait until Firaxis releases an expansion. The game has potential though, and I'll probably be returning to it in the future.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is vastly different to the previous versions, as it completely overhauls the tech tree, making it more of a tech web, in which you can decide the way that you want to expand.

												i feel people are being far too harsh on this game,it really boils down to 2 things,do you want civ 5 a game set in the past with historic racesordo you want a civ 5 like game set in the future where you dictate the evolution of humanity?the 2 games are very close with some key differences, you still build towns and cities, you fight, you trade, beyond earth, BE, has a really unique affinity feature that modifies what you turn into and every building and choice has a quest that modifies stats, adding up to layers of depth and some interesting insight into the future and all that.the sponsors are few yes, some features are lacking but civ5 before all the patchs and expansions used to take dozens of mods to get right so i have faith that future patchs will lead to good stuff, like that new and upcoming one that adds sea based cities, more sponsers, new trait systems and more!do i think this game is a souless shell of a reskin for civ 5? no.did i expect this to be a flawless and complete upgrade to civ 5 that improves everything? no.i expected a civ like game set on a different planet that is in the future and we got that.oh and the mods add so much good stuff and fix many problems.8/10 very decent but needs a few patchs and expansions to really get moving.

												I played CIV V for a while, and I gotta say, I put in DAYS into the game soon as I bought it, and it's DLC. DAYS.I bought this and played it as well, for DAYS nonstop, although the difficulty of the easiest mode I could beat in a few HOURS, instead of days, or lose in hours as I did twice in Civ V...  I did enjoy the randomness of the falling satellites and even the spawning of the alien hives. I didn't like, though, that the NEUTRAL cities were not anywhere near as useful as Civ V's, and if you don't get to them, and PROTECT THEM, they are easily destroyed by ALIENS AND ALLIED/ENEMY FORCES, which is dissappointing.It has possibilities, and I'll keep an eye out for the expansions.

												If you're the type who enjoys turn-based strategy, but are somehow new to the Civilization series, this will seem like an amazing game.For anyone who's played Civilization V, this will feel like a professionally-done mod of that game, and probably not worth full price. If you're looking for a ""Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri"" nostalgia trip, this is not likely to scratch that itch.Also, note that there are still a number of bugs that have been reported, but the game hasn't yet been patched. (Read forums for details.) Personally, the only bug I encountered was the inability to play full-screen at full resolution. If you have a modern monitor (120 Hz) or above, you'll probably want to wait until that issue is patched. (So far, I've been forced to play in Windowed mode.)My advice it to wait for patches and probably for a decent (30-50%) price drop.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am interested only in multiplayer games. I have played 48 hours, nearly all of that online. At this stage the game isnt recommended, only to try it and see how it is, but if you want to play more than 300 hours with this game (I have played nearly 2000 hours since civ 5 g&k), then this game isnt for you. Its always crashing in multiplayer games, most of the time only max 4 players map working good, but with 1 leaver it could be already a problem...There is too much luck factor in the game. If you get a startplace without aliens and with a neighbour not so far, but also not too close, you won the game if you can play good ofc, but if you get a startplace with 3-4 alien nest, you will never expand, cannt trade, and you already lose at early game, its clear to see.Best tactic is purity with prosperity, all other stuff is only just ""there"", but useless if you want the best output from everything. Same goes for waging war. Only melee troops needed, forget rangeds, and the cities are very easy to capture. Also if you make a city, you put 2 trade routes to it, and you have the most expensive troop in your brand new city in max 5 turns, and normally in all other cities 2-5 turns to make the best troops available, BUT there isnt any demographics window, and you just step at your neighbours borders, and we already have -1 player in the game, GREAT. All this happening from turn 75 usually (cause of aliens...), so I have to waste 1,5 hours of game time, to start again a new game.I really wanted to play with this game, since I am a civ 5 freak, but this game needs more patches, and maybe also an expansion pack, until that I cannt recommend it, its a half ready unbalanced game, nothing else.If you would like to play civ 5 instead, I have sad new for you, at 27. october new patch came, and since that day you can play only 1v1 in multiplayer, cause even with 3 players we get crash online. Thank you firaxis, now I have a very good civ 5, what isnt working online, and I have a half ready civ BE, which isnt 100% ready yet, and working only max with 4 players good.Please fix at least one of them, so I can play, cause I am not interested in any other games.

												I want to like this game, I do, but it has so many bugs and glitches present in it at the moment. I couldn't possibly recommend this game to someone in good faith, simply because they probably won't be able to play it for one reason or another. It gets stuck on random screens (especially diplomacy screens, which completely lack the ""accept"" or ""refuse offer"" buttons and do not respond to ANY input from keyboard or mouse). It has the worst resolution issues I have ever seen in ANY game on pc. Did they even do any QC testing on this game? I find it hard to believe that such horrible UI and resolution issues (pretty much the first two things you notice in a strategy game) could go unnoticed with anyone actually testing this game. Until the devs can get these blatant and obvious issues sorted out, don't pick this game up, even in a fire sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not enough of a change from Civ. For instance, the bizarre tech web seems original on the surface but is the same old experience after all. The aliens randomly flit back and forth from tile to tile, happily sitting in range of your cities until they are blasted out of existence. Cities have OP defences, meaning taking even a size 1 City would rival the Battle of Stalingrad. Diplomacy looks good but it is mostly chrome. UI does not give sufficient feedback on many occasions.

After playing for a few hours, the game make me think the folks in Civ HQ  either hate their job, or are so depressed in life that thier friends need to call a shrink to help them before they do something drastic.  would not be suprised if the patches to fix the game come in the form of DLC you will have to pay for.  oh and the alien population in the game are nearly pointless. even if you choose the most alien friendly path you still end up slaughting them.. if not only to see what could happen when thier ""angry"" ... poor Civ .. poor civ lovers.. and AC players don't look here   what ever you do.

												In one word, disappointing.  I can't write anything that others have not.  I purchased despite bad reviews due to my loyalty to the franchise; perhaps the authors' intent.  Bottom-line though - it looks nice and the orbital level is new, but there's all sorts of missing features that well, you'll miss from previous games. It's WAY too simple, in general, with not nearly enough options.  Auto-management of anything goes hay-wire, such as workers.  Enemy AI civs are not intelligent, even at high difficulties.Honestly, if I could get a refund I would.  Honestly, rest assured that it's okay to sit this one out and hope Firaxis gets the message so that next time they proivde real innovation to the game play itself.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As a big civ 5 fan I'm really disappointed by this one. They cut down so much from civ 5, all the great person system, tourism and religious. They might return later in the expansions but they aren't here now. Also the spy system is kind broken and the trade routes are very op and annonying as you get 2 for each city and have to rearrange them every 30 turns. In civ 5 you can only get few routes for the whole empire but now if you have many cities you will hate the trade routes soon. The health system is equal to the happiness but much less effective on you as the lose can be balanced by the powerful trade routes as they cancel the golden age system....Why there are no more great person? Why every leader is kinda same? You can no long find characristic ones like Gandi and some warmongers to help you put pressure on the other civs cause they all so passive they will only fight you or not at all. I really miss the leader screen in civ 5 as you can tell each country is different. In here (although you can argue they did for the affinity system) you just feel every leader is the same and you can't even remember them after few plays not like in civ 5 you know someone is always looking for trouble and the others will backstab you.One thing I'm really mad about this game is when you finish a technology instead of in civ 5 they give you some qoute from famous people they just give you a qoute from these in game characters (many of the characters don't even appear in the game other then the technology quote) which sometime you won't even understand what they are talking about. Also when you finish a wonde (in civ 5 they give you a great art shows that wonder) you get a blue base white drawing looks like a blueprint or something EVERYTIME. Come on, the wonders building become a very boring thing as all you get is just some status not a fulfill thing like you actually complete a wonder.This game might be much better after 2 expansion (not small dlcs), but I don't think it will ever be as good as civ 5. I don't recommend this even you just want to play civ 5 in space mode, cause you will be disappointed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you're the type who enjoys turn-based strategy, but are somehow new to the Civilization series, this will seem like an amazing game.For anyone who's played Civilization V, this will feel like a professionally-done mod of that game, and probably not worth full price. If you're looking for a ""Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri"" nostalgia trip, this is not likely to scratch that itch.Also, note that there are still a number of bugs that have been reported, but the game hasn't yet been patched. (Read forums for details.) Personally, the only bug I encountered was the inability to play full-screen at full resolution. If you have a modern monitor (120 Hz) or above, you'll probably want to wait until that issue is patched. (So far, I've been forced to play in Windowed mode.)My advice it to wait for patches and probably for a decent (30-50%) price drop.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fair warning, the AI is incredibly stupid!Do not put your workers on Auto.I had an AI partner and the first thing my workers starting doing was build a road halfway across the map, not focusing on any land improvements that would benefit me, no building a road.Do not start a war.I got sent a peace offering in which it demanded I surrendered one of my cities, I turned it down of course, then on the AI's turn it accepted it's own peace offering on my behalf, eventhough I turned it down. Making me lose that city.Do not Change your Personality.When I changed it to something that would increase the health of my cities, it suddenly decided to declare war on one of the others. There seemed to have been absolutely no other thing that could have caused that. I changed the personality and the game declared war.This game is incredibly buggy and the AI is attrocious.

												I love Civ. I love Civ IV and V equally, like two very different, but very gifted children (aaawwww). Alpha Centauri is an all-time fav. Basically, I love this genre, love Civ, and I don't even have particularly high expectations for each new entry.So I didn't need BE to a masterpiece. But I really wasn't expecting something so tepid.  This game feels totally phoned-in. It lacks the historical hooks of Civ and (inexplicably) the worldbuilding, story, or sense of risk that Alpha Centauri had 15 years prior. Aw well, better luck next time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alright, lets get down to it. As a die hard Civ fan, I was anxiously waiting up until release; where I started getting some mixed feelings. (Note that I have nearly 200 hours played, all of which are offline.)So, whats good about this game? - A fresh, but familiar feel. - A large graphic overhaul from the previous, Civ. - A very impressive Tech. Tree. - The true introduction of a ""Third Party"". Aliens>Barbarians. - The initial depth of the game is very impressive. Where as Civ. V didn't really pick up until the release of Brave New World. - A much more relevant, and sophisticated espionage system. - Finally, it runs near the effeciency of Civ. V. Key word here is, ""near"". The not so good:- Religion is now a thing of the past. This has basically removed a fairly large layer of the game. - Technology at and around the early phase is dreadfully slow. - The story is relatively boring. There's no real immersion, I don't lose track of time, and suddenly find myself playing 3 hours later. - The maps. This is a doozy. It feels like they just took the Civ V design, and then took a colour pallet and just re-painted it. There are no real texture changes. Just colours. It just looks, boring? All in all, the game meets my expectations. It's hard to come up with another Civ. game after the arguably best Civ game from the franchise. However, I believe Fraxis has the potential to make this game better. Which alone, is enough for me to recommend it to any strategy game player out there.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As a game alone Civilization Beyond Earth is an okay game, but when you compare it to the previous title Civilization V it just barely comes to tie with the Vanilla version, meaning if you have bought either Gods & Kings or Brave new world will Civ V rise as a much more enjoyable game.We will see what the first DLC does for the game but it has a lot to catch up on Civ V and unless it catches Civ V I cannot really recomend the game.

												i feel people are being far too harsh on this game,it really boils down to 2 things,do you want civ 5 a game set in the past with historic racesordo you want a civ 5 like game set in the future where you dictate the evolution of humanity?the 2 games are very close with some key differences, you still build towns and cities, you fight, you trade, beyond earth, BE, has a really unique affinity feature that modifies what you turn into and every building and choice has a quest that modifies stats, adding up to layers of depth and some interesting insight into the future and all that.the sponsors are few yes, some features are lacking but civ5 before all the patchs and expansions used to take dozens of mods to get right so i have faith that future patchs will lead to good stuff, like that new and upcoming one that adds sea based cities, more sponsers, new trait systems and more!do i think this game is a souless shell of a reskin for civ 5? no.did i expect this to be a flawless and complete upgrade to civ 5 that improves everything? no.i expected a civ like game set on a different planet that is in the future and we got that.oh and the mods add so much good stuff and fix many problems.8/10 very decent but needs a few patchs and expansions to really get moving.

												I want to like this game, I do, but it has so many bugs and glitches present in it at the moment. I couldn't possibly recommend this game to someone in good faith, simply because they probably won't be able to play it for one reason or another. It gets stuck on random screens (especially diplomacy screens, which completely lack the ""accept"" or ""refuse offer"" buttons and do not respond to ANY input from keyboard or mouse). It has the worst resolution issues I have ever seen in ANY game on pc. Did they even do any QC testing on this game? I find it hard to believe that such horrible UI and resolution issues (pretty much the first two things you notice in a strategy game) could go unnoticed with anyone actually testing this game. Until the devs can get these blatant and obvious issues sorted out, don't pick this game up, even in a fire sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am interested only in multiplayer games. I have played 48 hours, nearly all of that online. At this stage the game isnt recommended, only to try it and see how it is, but if you want to play more than 300 hours with this game (I have played nearly 2000 hours since civ 5 g&k), then this game isnt for you. Its always crashing in multiplayer games, most of the time only max 4 players map working good, but with 1 leaver it could be already a problem...There is too much luck factor in the game. If you get a startplace without aliens and with a neighbour not so far, but also not too close, you won the game if you can play good ofc, but if you get a startplace with 3-4 alien nest, you will never expand, cannt trade, and you already lose at early game, its clear to see.Best tactic is purity with prosperity, all other stuff is only just ""there"", but useless if you want the best output from everything. Same goes for waging war. Only melee troops needed, forget rangeds, and the cities are very easy to capture. Also if you make a city, you put 2 trade routes to it, and you have the most expensive troop in your brand new city in max 5 turns, and normally in all other cities 2-5 turns to make the best troops available, BUT there isnt any demographics window, and you just step at your neighbours borders, and we already have -1 player in the game, GREAT. All this happening from turn 75 usually (cause of aliens...), so I have to waste 1,5 hours of game time, to start again a new game.I really wanted to play with this game, since I am a civ 5 freak, but this game needs more patches, and maybe also an expansion pack, until that I cannt recommend it, its a half ready unbalanced game, nothing else.If you would like to play civ 5 instead, I have sad new for you, at 27. october new patch came, and since that day you can play only 1v1 in multiplayer, cause even with 3 players we get crash online. Thank you firaxis, now I have a very good civ 5, what isnt working online, and I have a half ready civ BE, which isnt 100% ready yet, and working only max with 4 players good.Please fix at least one of them, so I can play, cause I am not interested in any other games.

Cities have OP defences, meaning taking even a size 1 City would rival the Battle of Stalingrad. Diplomacy looks good but it is mostly chrome. UI does not give sufficient feedback on many occasions.

												This game has a ton of nice features that can't be found in the other Civ games and I really appreciate the new environment but ultimately it feels very shallow. There simply isn't enough content and it's missing things from Civ V that would've been really appreciated. Also something that bothers me a lot is that the aliens and resources don't change even though you're supposed to be visiting different planets. Wow we sure are the exception when every other f'ing planet in the universe has a specific breed of aliens and floatstones. I know that it would be difficult to produce the variety that I'm asking for but the issue is that they put this goal on themselves and not surprisingly failed to produce any real variety.I think DLC could make this game great but for now it's just too expensive to justify when it's competing mechanically with Civ 5 and thematically with several other 4X space games (endless space and galactic civilizations just to name a couple).

 A very deep and thought provoking 4X...if only for a few hours. Only can recommend for those who are very hardcore Civilization fans and are willing to shell out $50 for about as much content as Civ 5 had at release.  Pros and Cons further down, TL:DR version here. DO NOT purchase this game if you have not played Civilization V with all the DLC and are looking for a good Strategy game. You can get Civilization V Complete for the same price as this and have hundreds of hundreds of hours of content between the DLC and the Workshop. I only recommend this for the very hardcore Civilization fans who can deal with not amount of content. Firaxis always has expansions to their games now, so I would wait until the first expansion is out to consider this game, if you're in need of a new 4X play Age of Wonders 3 or Endless Legend, you can even go old school and kick it with Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri. If you have $50 to spend then go for it. This is a really good game and it shows, but the lack of content will leave you wanting more and the price tag is not enough for me to recommend it to anyone but the most fanatical Civ fans.Pros:+ Deep and thought provoking narritive into the victories and how you advance as a civilization. Augmenting yourself with technology or becoming more alien, or rejecting the two.+ Huge UI improvements, everything is much neater than Civilization V, no more right-clicking through 200 Citystate messages and quests.+ Non-Linear technology web, allows players to plan and use more strategy in their game.+ Steam Workshop Support+ Builds off the Civilization V engine, allowing newcomers to feel welcome and experts to jump right into the game and expierence the new features themselves.+ Revamped policy system,  lots of bonuses and extra goodies allowing for a much better time for those who don't rake in loads of culture, while rewarding those who do.Cons:- Lack of content is HUGE in this game, especially coming off the wealth of content Civilization V with all the DLC had. Games take nowhere near as long as in Civ V. You will find yourself out of things to build reletively quickly, not many buildings and units.- Maps are reletively small and barren, there aren't any landmarks to discover and there aren't enough Civilizations to have a large map akin to Earth like in Civilization V, there's no real thrill to exploring, just getting slaughtered by aliens.- Diplomacy is non-existent. It's just like how it was in Civilization V, but doesn't take intol account the futuristic setting very well. Trading resources means nothing because you don't need any (besides oil), the ones you need are granted to you by developing affinities, and they do not do anything for your people (no happiness increase, no city-state quests to fufill, no we love the king day)- AI is brain dead. Every game I've played the AI doesn't go for a victory other than Domination. They end up warring with each other eternally, attacking aliens (attacking aliens make every alien on the map more hostile to any civilization) and just having so many units that they lose hundreds of energy (currency) per turn. - Barely any buildings to make, no units either.- No Great People, even Generals and Admirals.- Games take a short amount of time, even on Normal and Epic times due to the ease to achieve victory and lack of other content.I'd give it about an average score, 6/10. What's there works well and blends nicely into the game, it runs very well and everything looks gorgeous. But it's not enough to keep your attention for more than a little bit at a time (you can obviously tell from my playtime. I have ten times this on Civ 5.) Wait until more expansions come out and the price drops. This game is NOT worth $50. It's worth $20. ",122,20,3,28,17,0,13

A New Beginning...Beyond Earth started out as a game with much to learn. Keeping the format of Civilization V, but a different idea in victories and social aspects, the story advances through a number of challenges, three specfically. Obviously, you are settling on an alien planet, you're not gonna be the only sentient one there. The first challenge you encounter is learning about the aliens on your planet, and what it takes to make them not a problem. Three affinities are available to choose from to lead your civilization in a certain manner of belief and social aspect. -Harmony, the affinity of peace and alliance. If you think you can find a way to co-exist or to ""bond"" with the aliens on your planet, and think your civilization would best prosper with the help of the neighbors near you, then you're someone meant for Harmony.-Supremacy, the affinity of technological bondage and neutrality. Look back on yourself, and your past life or current interests. Were you that one guy who knew almost everything about technology, were you the one always called ""computer geek"" or tech-guru? Supremacy is the belief of bonding technology with humanity, literally bonding, no we're not gonna talk Borg or whatever hivemind thing Star-Trek has going on there, we're talking about mixing technology with the human body and discovering what and how technology benefits the human body and what enhancements comes with it. Aliens were never a problem in our world, we don't have the need or desire to eradicate them. They don't cross our borders, we don't cross theirs. Thats the view of supremacy.-Purity, you know, you will always find the one guy in your life that always sticks to the old-time Earth. The one guy that doesn't let history go and that one guy who just was meant to be born and pass away on Earth. In the life of a ""pure"" man, we will seek to lead a pure world, to convert this new world to Earth. We will see to it that the legacy and heritage of Earth will live on to new worlds and not die with it. But, to restore old-Earth on this new world, this must mean to restore ""old-Earth"". That means everything we saw on Earth will be everything we will see on this new world. To make that happen is to erase all alien life on the planet and restore it with as much Earth life as we can. Purity is not to be looked at as the more hostile belief, but to make things the way they were and should be.Now the different victories are quite the different topic, there are only three victories that are associated with each of these affinities. One other, being the ""other"" one. Four victories total. The ""other"" one, is known as Contact. First it starts out with your first explorer. This explorer happened to stumble upon some wreckage or ruin of some sort. But it wasn't some natural ruin, it was definitely made by some being. Some being very similar to our human race. Which means, that we were not the first ones to settle here on this new world. This obviously, is not an everyday discovery and definitely catches the public and scientific communities attention. So you put more research into it, thus you discover something known as ""The Signal"". ""The Signal"" is that one bit of data and information roaming out there in the depths of space that can only be caught by technology similar to our kind. We finally discovered that one bit of information and gave us a great amount of data to find more about this earlier civilization. What they are, who they are, what they need, why they need. Are they in refuge? Do they need settlement, could we provide that for them? Can we make Contact with this civilization. The answer is, Yes. We will make contact with this past civilization to learn of their mistakes and how we can prepare for the same occurences to come. We will provide them with what they need, and we will do that with a powerful and monumental beacon. To make Contact, with the beyond.The rest of the victories are for you to discover.But this doesn't end here. Now there's something coming, something we never expected before. There's more of Earth to send to our planet, more of what we did not know. The Rising Tide is coming, and now..The Wait is Over. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As usual, Tom Chick of Quarter To Three puts it perfectly and much more eloquently than I ever could:http://www.quartertothree.com/fp/2014/10/25/occasionally-thrilling-beyond-earth-cant-quite-get-beyond-civilization-v/I'm a huge fan of the series, there is no other franchise I've spent so much time on as Civilization. So after a dumbed-down, disappointing Civilization V I had high hopes for this installement. Unfortunately it completely failed to deliver. The AI is about as smart as a loaf of bread. The much touted tech web is just a more confusing version of the tech tree. Technologies feel random and arbitrary. The entire setting is very hard to get into. While ordinary Civilization allows you to develop a good intuition about the relative strength of various units (e.g. musketeer vs longbowman) in Beyond Earth you have no idea (quick, is a CNDR or an Apostle the stronger unit?). This is made worse by the fact that you can't even hover over enemy units to find out how strong they are or the fact that there are only a handful of unit categories and units within a category look nearly identical. It is very hard to get the information you need in this game. Want to quickly see who's at war with whom? No luck. Want to see how you are faring in comparison to other civilizations? Except for a rough victory progress and points comparison you cannot see technologies, production, energy output and other vital statistics like this.The game forces you to make decisions all the time. Not in the good kind of interesting and relevant decisions, but random ""quest"" decisions that pop up dialogs and force you to make a mostly meaningless A/B choice while ironically blurring out the very information you'd need to make an informed decision.Diplomacy is even more useless than usual. Except for declaring war you cannot really do anything meaningful. While resource and technology trading used to be an important part of the game it is unnecessary here. You can trade for ""favours"" with the AI, but they seem to have no discernable value whatsoever.The game is dumbed down to the point where I could automate everything, including end-of-turn, and watch the game auto win itself. On one of the difficulty settings where the AI gets a bonus too!Wonders have been castrated to the extend that a first time Civilization player I introduced to the game didn't even realize he built one until I told him. Compare that to the race up to be the first to finish a wonder in older Civilizations. You'd get a rewarding mini video, a building on the map and a significant bonus. Here it's just one more random thing you click on.On a technical side the game doesn't work in fullscreen mode for some high resolution, high refresh rate settings. And, even more annoyingly, AI turns take inexcusibly long. I don't know if anyone has the patience to finish a huge map - I certainly don't.Summary: A string of repetitive, boring decisions with no real pay-off to show for it. Civilization IV Beyond the Sword remains the pinnacle of the series. I recommend sticking with that instead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's actually not that bad. I do like new mechanics, music and looks. New factions could've been more defined and there's A LOT of bugs at the moment but its worth playing anyway, at least if you don't have Civ 5 with most of the addons.The main issue for me so far is the lack of patches. The game often crashes, gets stuck, even on the first turn or while loading saves. There are bugs with quests and aliens too.There's also a noticeable issues with maps - they all look the same, there's NO DIFFERENCE in landscape, planet colors and vegetation, despite planets supposedly being different. Even worse - there are issues with map generation and tiles connections, even though they fixed similar issue in Civ 5.I would've also liked hints for ""advanced start"" options to be finally included in the game.Just wait for the discount and some patches before buying it.

												First off, I disagree with the reviews that say this is simply Civ V in space.  Yes, it is superficially similar in appearance, but there are myriad differences.  It is a very different game in the same family.  It is not a reskin.That said, would I suggest buying it at new-game price?  No.  There are some design decisions that make the game unfun, especially on repeated playthroughs.  The AI is pretty bad, and it is very, very non-aggressive.  Unless you go out of your way to annoy other leaders, they don't declare war.  A military is barely necessary.  Instead of interesting tactical battles, you'll spend a ton of time micromanaging trade routes, which is really tedious.Almost all the victory conditions involve building major projects, then waiting while they do stuff.  Yes, they can be interfered with with military units, but the AI won't declare war.  So, the end game is basically always pushing the next turn button for 30-50 turns waiting for a win that is never in doubt.There is a LOT here to build a good game on, and I expect that Firaxis eventually will, through patches, and expecially through DLC, but it's frankly worth waiting on.

												I have been trying to get into this game, and I have played the civ games since #2, but there is no real experience to be had with Beyond Earth.  I'm not saying that it is no better than the others, I am saying that it is the worst civ game I have ever played.  There really is nothing to do.The following sentence sums it up:  Nothing more than a poorly implemented Civ 5 Mod, which claims to be a full game of its own, but fails miserably.I have played three games, and have never been attacked ONCE.  Not by aliens or other factions.  Factions?  Thats not an accurate word.  Templates is more like it, as they are all the same.  No personality, no back stories, nothing.  A faction makes itself a faction by their beliefs on how things should be, but these templates have no beliefs.  Later in the game, you choose what direction you want humanity to go down but the only thing that changes in the game is the faction leaders pictures change.  The way they talk and what they say are just generic responses still.There is nothing to hold interest, no dramatic artwork when you build a building or wonder for the first time, no voice overs, and they actually used the begining movie clip in the game as the trailer, and that was nothing.Very little imagination went into this game.  There is NO writting as there is NO story.If you want to get a description of anything new (building or creature), you have to manually search the civilipeedia.I have not been playing because I am enjoying it, I have been playing to desperatly see if there is any content that I missed.  But there IS...NO...CONTENT...Any new feature they are promoting actually turns out to be an annoyance or in some way a repetitive action that just gives you carple tunnle.But the worst, the absolute worst issue I cannot get over is the terraforming.

You start with a bland looking ""alien"" map, which consists of reskining food, minerals, etc, and you can cut down forrests (which are already there).   I can 100% verify that you there is NO point in exploring, as it does nothing to benefit you.  You can literally just stay where you are, develop a few cities, and have absolutely no interference from ""factions"" (the blank template people) or aliens (barbariens made into bugs - NOTHING special or unique).Because of this game I will never pre-order any game from any game company again.If you are a civ fan, stay away from the game, save your money, and stick to Civ5.

												When compared to Civ 5 it adds nice new mechanics, unit upgrades, and space ship benefits. However it does just feel like Civ 5 with some spacey themes added in the not too distant future. The game does feel empty a lot of time, lacking animations for stalite launches seems like an easy oversight. The factions do not have any history as to why they left earth or what their ideologies are, while this allows you to make them your own it plays little importance to who you start the game with. Trade routes are a nightmare and if anything way over powered when doubled with the coastal space craft add on. Miasma apparently hurts despite all units wearing 21st century space suits. One major bug was also free unit upgrades when a higher affinity was reached. This encourages you to spam cheap units and upgrade them for free.Now lets compare it to alpha centauri. Its♥♥♥♥♥♥No unit customisationNo unit upgrade managementNo sea basesNo terraformingNo spy armiesNo trading technologiesAliens seem limitedFactions (sorry sponsors) aren't anywhere near as deep or as exciting to play as.To put it blunt my views reflect most players who loved SMAC.

In spite of a puzzlingly weak AI and an overall lack of adequet game balance and personality, Beyond Earth‘s unique theme, excellent presentation and engaging gameplay ultimately won me over.I will give this game a cautious recommendation for dedicted 4X strategy fans only. Although I enjoy playing CivBE, I'll be the first to admit that there's still a lot of work to be done for this game to reach its full potential.If you're not a hardcore fan of the Civilization series then I would advise waiting for the upcoming ""2.0"" patch and Rising Tide expansion that the developers have showcased for the fall of 2015.It’s far from perfect then, but Beyond Earth has still succeeded in delivering an utterly absorbing strategy title that will likely hold my attention for a long time hereafter. But can we try and add a little more feeling in the first expansion please, Firaxis?Read the full review at my blog »[www.celjaded.com] ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Do I recommend this game? No, I do not. Why not? Because it's dull.As a Civ V player with over 300 hours into it, I know how some civ's spend, maybe, ten turns doing nothing but mashing ""End Turn"". But after that, stuff happens. In BE, stuff doesn't happen. Stuff might occur, once in a while, but then it still saunters by instead of it happening.It's a dumbed-down reskin of Civ V's launch version. This game should have started off from where Civ V ended, not from where it's predecesor began.			",42,38,0,16,6,4,36

So after a dumbed-down, disappointing Civilization V I had high hopes for this installement. Unfortunately it completely failed to deliver. The AI is about as smart as a loaf of bread. The much touted tech web is just a more confusing version of the tech tree. Technologies feel random and arbitrary. The entire setting is very hard to get into. While ordinary Civilization allows you to develop a good intuition about the relative strength of various units (e.g. musketeer vs longbowman) in Beyond Earth you have no idea (quick, is a CNDR or an Apostle the stronger unit?). This is made worse by the fact that you can't even hover over enemy units to find out how strong they are or the fact that there are only a handful of unit categories and units within a category look nearly identical. It is very hard to get the information you need in this game. Want to quickly see who's at war with whom? No luck. Want to see how you are faring in comparison to other civilizations? Except for a rough victory progress and points comparison you cannot see technologies, production, energy output and other vital statistics like this.The game forces you to make decisions all the time. Not in the good kind of interesting and relevant decisions, but random ""quest"" decisions that pop up dialogs and force you to make a mostly meaningless A/B choice while ironically blurring out the very information you'd need to make an informed decision.Diplomacy is even more useless than usual. Except for declaring war you cannot really do anything meaningful. While resource and technology trading used to be an important part of the game it is unnecessary here. You can trade for ""favours"" with the AI, but they seem to have no discernable value whatsoever.The game is dumbed down to the point where I could automate everything, including end-of-turn, and watch the game auto win itself. On one of the difficulty settings where the AI gets a bonus too!Wonders have been castrated to the extend that a first time Civilization player I introduced to the game didn't even realize he built one until I told him. Compare that to the race up to be the first to finish a wonder in older Civilizations. You'd get a rewarding mini video, a building on the map and a significant bonus. Here it's just one more random thing you click on.On a technical side the game doesn't work in fullscreen mode for some high resolution, high refresh rate settings. And, even more annoyingly, AI turns take inexcusibly long. I don't know if anyone has the patience to finish a huge map - I certainly don't.Summary: A string of repetitive, boring decisions with no real pay-off to show for it. Civilization IV Beyond the Sword remains the pinnacle of the series. I recommend sticking with that instead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First off, I disagree with the reviews that say this is simply Civ V in space.  Yes, it is superficially similar in appearance, but there are myriad differences.  It is a very different game in the same family.  It is not a reskin.That said, would I suggest buying it at new-game price?  No.  There are some design decisions that make the game unfun, especially on repeated playthroughs.  The AI is pretty bad, and it is very, very non-aggressive.  Unless you go out of your way to annoy other leaders, they don't declare war.  A military is barely necessary.  Instead of interesting tactical battles, you'll spend a ton of time micromanaging trade routes, which is really tedious.Almost all the victory conditions involve building major projects, then waiting while they do stuff.  Yes, they can be interfered with with military units, but the AI won't declare war.  So, the end game is basically always pushing the next turn button for 30-50 turns waiting for a win that is never in doubt.There is a LOT here to build a good game on, and I expect that Firaxis eventually will, through patches, and expecially through DLC, but it's frankly worth waiting on.

												I enjoy this game alot even though I need a higher graphics card. I like the variety of of units and using affinty points. But the only thing is I didn't really find myself going back to the game unless I was going to make a new game probably because i not really a civilisation collecter or player i'm just not sure. So I would recommend this game for players who can spend the time playing this game.If you can would you please comment about this review to say yeah it was ok or not it was bad thank you.P.S I got a new laptop I can handle the graphics nowP.P.S I think this game is so much better when you play multiplayer.

I see people saying this over and over, that it feels a lot like a beta game and I want to disagree, but I can't.It's going to be a good game, but right now I'll say try out Civ5, it's polished and complete.In all honestly, this one really feels like a Civ5 mod anyway.After a few patches, I'll visit my review again.

												Civilization – Beyond TediousFirst off I want to say I am a huge fan of the Civilization series.  However Civilization: Beyond Earth leaves much to be desired when compared to its’ predecessors.   The game is reasonably fun, but the sheer uniformity of the tech tree, military units, uninspiring wonders, and confusing victory requirements makes the game get very old very fast.  Having to constantly micro manage all of my trade routes every few turns and manually send in a unit to my victory portals each and every turn for 20 turn quickly saps any satisfaction I might have once received from the game.TL;DR buy Civilization 5 it’s a far superior game.

												I've been playing the Civ games since the very first. I think Civilization is one of the best franchises ever. Sadly, at this point, SMC:BE is a pale imitation of prior glories. Even on the fastest setting, the pace is glacially slow, and once you have the aliens under control, you are in for a boring slog to endgame. The unit upgrade mechanics mean that your force cycles between ""can't hurt anything"" and ""instawin battle"" as far as opponents go. Because unit upgrades are tied to affinities, you end up choosing tech research based pretty much completely on if the apporpriate icon is present on the tech. Positives? The AI leaders are actually reasonable when it comes to trade (who hasn't had a Civ 5 leader turn down a 3-luxury-unit for 1 trade?). I've dropped about a week  into it now, and am about to delete and re-install Civ 5. Maybe it will be a good game by the time the third DLC pack drops, we'll see.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												WOW!! It has been so long since my last review I honestly can't remember what game it was for. What, you might ask, could have possibly convinced me to finally end that  hiatus? Paying for a game I cannot play.  The support for post launch bugs from Firaxis has been near nonexistent. I have never had a large game studio fail to deliver a playable game before. Sure I have had my fair share of games with bugs, games that required some kind of fix or update to work, or games that just sucked from the get go. But having a game I cannot play at all is kind of a distant memory for me. It hasn't happened in so long I had forgotten what it felt like. I have already attempted the re-install, updating my drivers, changing a video setting the .ini file. None of this has worked and I am not alone. There are forum posts here on Steam filled with people having the same problem. I like to preorder games that I know I am going to buy anyway. This is so I can get the early access or gimmick items but this game has left a bad taste in my mouth. I know one experience will not be enough for me to stop that practice altogether but it will be enough for me to never preorder another 2K game again or pay full price for another Firaxis game.

												As a great fan of Civilization V, I have been looking forward to Beyond Earth all year. My expectations were pretty high, and I expected at least all the things that were good in Civ 5 to appear in Beyond Earth, but that hope was idle.The problems with this game are numerous, and I doubt I will address all of them here. However, before we get to the bad, let's start with the good.The good- There are no major bugs that I have seen, except for some odd behaviour when loading the game sometimes.- The engine runs very smooth.- Some bold choices have been made, including a tech web and specializing your civilization through an affinity. There are a number of ""quests"" but for reasons I will go over later, they are extremely shallow.The bad- Civilizations are bland and boring, and there is almost nothing to set them apart.- You can choose a few starting parameters for your civilization, but there are clearly ""better"" options here to the point where taking anything else nerfs you even before you begin.- Wonders are in the game but are weak, boring and sometimes outright silly.- Except for Domination, all victory conditions are pretty much the same: build a building, wait around 30 turns, and win. They are completely non-interactive.- Diplomacy is a complete mess and just doesn't work. It was already bad in Civ 5 but it's worse here. Luckily, because there is no interaction needed for winning, it can be completely ignored.- Tactical battles are poor. In Civ 5, the 1 unit per tile was good but sometimes a pain. It could be alleviated by choosing certain promotions or getting later game units. In Beyond Earth, the terrain is much worse with lots of mountains, miasma and other impassible terrain. This makes combat horrendous.- Promotions: these are just utterly boring. You can choose to get either a 50 point heal, or 10% combat strength when your unit levels up.- Unit upgrades: You get these by increasing your affinity level. You do that by quests or teching. The problem here is that with some luck, you can get affinity pretty fast, in which case your units completely dominate the opponent very quickly.  If not, then you are forced to research in a certain way, meaning that the tech web might as well be lineair. Even if you manage to upgrade your units, they stay bland and boring throughout the game until the very end, when they change from boring to utterly broken.- Quests: Most quests consist of: build two of this building to choose an extra effect for it. Those effects cannot be seen anywhere, so you can only know what you need to build by committing all of that information to memory after numerous playthroughs. The stat bonuses do not necessarily make sense.- The removal of city states, great people and luxuries: These three things added a lot of depth to strategical choices in Civ 5. They are completely removed in Beyond Earth and not replaced by anything.- Happiness: This has been replaced by health, which is an almost irrelevant mechanic. Which is good because staying healthy is reliant only on social policies and buildings, forcing you once again to give up the non-lineairity of the tech web.- Visually this game is not pleasing at all. Not only does everything look the same, but that same is depressing, unclear and intentionally blurred near the edges of your screen. There is no option to turn that off yet, but they will fix that they said. That doesn't change that everything looks dead, the color scheme is: brown, purple, dark green. It gives me a headache.- The ""story"" that develops ends in oblivion after a few quests. No explanations are given anywhere and the end texts (there are no end animations or anything) just say something vague that means nothing at all, under the guise of ""we leave it to your imagination"".- Enormous overhead in micromanaging workers and trade routes. This takes up more effort than actually building your empire.- Orbital units, the new ""thing"" in Beyond Earth are not very satisfying. They once again add some passive benefits, and some can be used offensively, but it's a mechanic that doesn't add much to the game.Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this game to anyone. If you don't already own Civilization V, then it's a much better choice than this. If you do own Civ V, then play that instead unless you are completely bored with it (although this won't alleviate your boredom for long). If you are a big fan of Sci Fi, then please just wait until this is on sale and has gotten an expansion.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Since I already own the game, I am forced to wait for modders to step up and fix the problems, but I wouldn't pay more than $10 for this POC.Oh, and multiplayer seems extremely flawed ... but so is the current AI.

												After a year, I can say that although I enjoyed Beyond Earth, I would not recommend it to anyone still sitting on the fence.  We wanted Alpha Centauri and we got a weird version of Civ 5.  The explorer unit was largely worthless, the aliens perpetually hostile, the resources limited, and the neighbors stupid.  Boating on this strange new world was ridiculously hazardous.  A small issue that drove me nuts was the find the crashed satellite and recover the data.  This was fundamental to one track of the dispositions... and sometimes the satellite was no where to be found.  I never did find out what the starships function was on the menu screen and by the time that Rising Tide came out, I was thoroughly done and on to another game.  All in all, Beyond Earth is not a bad game, just lacking.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pros: It is not just civ 3 with new graphics.  That is about it.Cons: AI is terrible.  It reminds me of Red Alert 1 where the AI was just ultra aggressive regardless of being allied or not.  There is almost zero point in diplomacy as the ""favor"" system does not work at all (At least not in the way it is described in game) and even your best allies will spy and steal from you.   The fact that it takes place on another planet is pretty pointless as the planets all have the same things.  The ""affinity"" you choose does not matter beyond what special units you get and those units are usually completely worthless for the resources they need.  There is little to no consistency in city health and almost zero ways to improve city health beyond using specific virtues.  The Virtue system is also terrible in its implentation.  The ""advisor"" in the game is terrible.  It gives suggestions that you actually cannot do.  It also seems to just fixate on one thing.  One game it would not shut up about spies, after they were all assigned to a task but it kept telling me to go look at the covert ops tab.  Another game it kept popping up about trade routes.  While I had all my routes full.  The AI is terrible.Basically, they took all the terrible things from Civ 5 and ignored all the good things.  From what I have heard, the newest expansion is supposed to ""fix"" it.  But I do not think I should have to pay $90 to get a game that does not give me a headache to play. ",203,16,2,44,9,1,44

I feel like they could have done more with the orbital layer.5. Aliens are kinda dumb.. they are cool and powerful early but then u get 1 affinty and then they suck, the barabrians in civ 5 at least upgraded.6. Stations are pretty boring, they give you stuff if you trade with them thats it.7. Health is annoying as hell, because the only way to get it is to build buidlings, and thats it. There is probobaly other things, but thats it. If you love Civ, get the game. If its just good to you then don't. In my opinion Civ 5 is better but whatever. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I should have learned my lesson with both Civ IV and Civ V - and that lesson is, wait until the first 'bundle' edition that includes several expansions (at least 2) before buying any Civ game. Along with many in-game traditions, the strongest and most visible tradition of the Civ series is that fixes and balance tweaks are hidden inside of many of the expansions, so much that the vanilla version of the game is exposed as having been released incomplete.While this version is very playable (I did not experience any crashes or other performance issues), it was far tou simple at the default settings. The AI of other 'nations' is lacking any dept and it appears that whatever the 'default attitude' of each NPC happens to be at turn 1 is going to be how they behave entirely, regardless of your actions or how you treat them. I destroyed nations that wanted to trade with me to the bitter end, defiantly offering gestures of friendship and taking time to tell me how much we had in common. I had AI nations throw their entire army at me and reduce me to ruins before I really had an idea where they were on the map. One of them crossed through the territory of two other nations to get to me.So basically, wait for 2 expansions, and buy the bundle - everything should be fixed and completed by then.

												I truly, truly regret buying this game. I love sci-fi and I love the Civ franchise. This is the worst of both worlds; let me elaborate.2 things are common knowledge; 1} that we cannot travel to other worlds and colonize them yet, and 2} the ability to do so would require a major advance in techology and understanding of science and the universe.Why then would Aircraft carriers regress in the future? Currently they can hold tens of planes, but according to the game they can only hold 1. I understand limiting the number they can hold for strategy and simplicities sake but seriously? Only one?It's the future, why are animals so destructive? Wouldn't we be able to figure out some effective and efficient way to deal with them?Why is diplomacy so basic and limited?Take everything that Civ 5 was, give it a sci-fi skin, and scale it back; then you'll have a decent idea of this game.I wanted to like this game, I truly did.

												I bought it in 2017. It was good at first and seemed like a much less annoying Civ title with units upgrading on their own, simpler interface, etc. After several games, I realized that every play through is bland, victory conditions are practically the same, and AI players are predictable and annoying. Still, I enjoyed the game despite the ""rub"" for some time.Then in one game, I built a ""Promiseland"" gate which was supposed to teleport earthlings. After you get 20 settled, you win the game. Nothing was happening. The victory screen said: ""the earthlings are coming right now."" They were not. Finally, I realized there was a worker unit ""stuck"" in the gate trying to build a road to it and never finishing it. Ok fine, small bug, no problem. I removed the worker. Now I could teleport earthlings manually (it does not happen automatically like the instructions say) one per turn. Guess what: the automated workers plugged the gate up every turn! This is 3 years after the release date! You can work around the annoinces like those, but bottom line is: the game is a shallow remake of CivV with less balance, less variety, and worse interface.

												I’ve never liked Civ Games in the past as I always had a hard time with kluging of the historical mechanics and seeing Napoleon strutting around with Stalin etc ….I was / am very fond of SMAX  since it did not need the kluge and had very interesting factions / environment. I thought the Units were a little lack-luster however  – even with the WorkshopCiv BE on the other hand has been a true joy:-	No History Kluge (Alien planet)-	Interesting City / Empire development without it becoming too Math / Puzzle-like-	Very enjoyable units with Purity so far  (have not played as the other 2 yet)-	Atmosphere is awesome – love the music. It’s perfect for an alien planet (I really like EL, ES and AOW III – but  Jazz or World-music for 4x …. No way ….) -	A well built up empire with Mag rails, trade routes, various improvements is a work of art … very pleasing to the eye – sometimes I just scroll around a bit and enjoy it like a well-built model or painting … -	Alien life is exotic and adds to the immersion – but would like to see some eventual Cult of Planet / Mind Worm style connections etc  … and some Progenitors-	Stable – not one crash – can Alt + Tab with no issuesOn the slightly negative side , the Diplomacy is lacking – no Trading of Techs, No propositions to have joint attacks on enemy cities ….Also – The Factions themselves don’t have a great deal of flavor so with the somewhat lacking diplomacy, I just keep them under control until I can enjoy annihilating them  …. Overall – it is one of my favorite gaming experiences at the moment and I am looking forward to a nice expansion or 2 to get into the SMAX quality range …. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Im a massive fan of the CIV series but this game while it has a couple of improvements its by far alot worse than the previous games.I got the game and was willing to give it a chance and keep trying to put more time into it but its just so dull,i wouldnt recommend unless its at least 75% including all current and future dlc. Sorry but i will stick to CIV V and its content any day.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is basically Civ V that has a nicely fleshed out affininity system where you can choose to become alien yourself, become space nazis and try to wipe out aliens to further the human race or bcome robots. The aliens in the game seem really lack luster but more intersting then barabrians. There are unique winning conditions that are affinity specific like becoming one with the hive mid, or invade ""Old Earth"" and bring them ""salvation"" with your superior technology. All in all this is pretty much a really big mod for 50 bucks. If you can wait for a sale or just a really big Civ fan, then I can't reccomend this game. It would've been better if the aliens were more involved with your settling into the new alien planet. If there were different types of aliens depending on the planet you choose and more interesting factions to choose from. Until they can add something like this, to me, this is not worth getting.

												You remember how Civ 5 was fairly straighforward? Where you would choose from 5 different technologie to research at a time, unlock units and buildings along the way. Then if you were losing gold, you'd build gold producting buildings? Or if you were unhappy, you'd build things that increased happiness? Well they got rid of that. Now you're either drastically behind on tecnology, hemmoraging energy, or at -50 health the entire game, struggling to stay afloat while the other civilizations are kicking♥♥♥♥♥ You know when you hit a slump in Civ 5 where you are basically just waiting for all of your cities to finish buildings, but have fairly low production, and you're just hitting ""Next Turn"" for half an hour? Thats basically the entirety of this game. At least in my experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Simply put, the game is flawed.The AI is laughable at best, and this goes for both Civilizations and Aliens. For example:1) The Aliens are always inclined to attack you even when you're peaceful with them or their foe is by far more superior. So, when my Brawler, an Affinity unit stands fortified near them, they will all attack and all die.2) Some units like the Kraken, the strongest Alien in the game (I believe) can only move and attack in deep ocean. Therefore I killed a Kraken with the weakest ranged naval unit in the game.3) The civilizations build armies but of the wrong kind of units. An ironic quote would be one from the game; ""You fight with the army you have. Make sure it's the army you want"". It seems both the army the Civlizations have and the one they want suck either way.The new happiness system, Health, is dumb. You can really do nothing else to improve a low health level besides building a few specific buildings which are extremely sparse and lacking in the beginning (If you build ""tall"", if it's still called that in BE), and the system will just end up hindering your progress anyways to improve your level. Because, of course, a lack in health causes a lack in research, which stalls when you can next research the technology required to build something which will improve it. In Civ V, happiness was easy to fix thanks to the luxury resource system. However now it is all based 99% off of population, and that's significantly harder and more frustrating to fix.The Research is fine, though the new Web feature and lack of advisor guidance when trying to pick what you want to research makes it significantly harder to stay decently caught up in worker techs and such whilst being able to grab an important technology for an Affinity.The culture has not changed at all except for the social policies, now called Virtues, forming more around the new difficulties (and one around population).These notes seem scattered, so let me summarize this. The game is flawed. It is a different beast than Civ V, and should be approached as such. The AI choices and Research paths, along with the lack of personality (and animation? I recieved none) in the leaders causes for a large lack of depth in the gameplay. The game was monotonous and repetitive, and when I felt the game was going to get exciting as War broke loose, I left even more disheartened.The spy system was pretty cool though, I'll give them that.So, for the time being, I would NOT buy this game. I don't feel like I was even close to summing up how dissapointed I was when I tried it. In my honest opinion, Civ V with or without complete DLC is equal to or better than Civ Beyond Earth, respectively. Do keep track of patches and note for changes in the AI and such. After a few patches and some DLC (which usually fixes a lot of things), then maybe this game will be worth the $50 Firaxis is asking for. Until then, I do not reccomend this game.Quick edit: Replayability is huge though granted all the options.

												I'm long time fan of Civilization series and I have very mixed feeling about this one - unfortunately on ""No"" side more then on ""Yes"". On a good side:First of all, I had a lot of fun playing it for first 3 or 4 times. Everything was fresh new, I had to learn a lot and this side of the game is as always very nice for me. Unfortunately  once I got those games behind me I find it hard to come back for more. I love the quests implemented in this game - they really add a lot of depth - you can make different choices each time you play and your civilization will be affected by them - you can shape it to be a bit different.There are a lot of problems with make this game either boring or annoying to play:- military - auto-upgrading military units sounded like fun at start but then once you start war it's really really annoying. Your enemy's units can at any moment upgrade to a much better unit on the field. There are not that many units overall, which probably could be fine if they were not being upgraded automatically - but with automatic upgrades it feels like you have very limited toolbox to use for war. Also upgrades are way too big between levels, they should be more gradual. You need to get few points of affinity to upgrade a unit again and then it's like major change. So in order to win a war you basically focus just on technologies that raise your affinity for affinity's sake, not for anything that this technology brings to your civilization.- economy - trade is especially annoying, in late game when you have 2 or 3 trade units per city, you constantly have to pick another trade target for them, every single turn. On the other hand trade is very powerful and without it your civilization will be in a disadvantage so you can't just ignore it.- I also hate how this game no longer rewards me for playing. End game? Just one picture, no way to check my progress against other civilization, some pathetic text ""you win"" and that's all. When you get a new technology, it's described very poorly and quote that is read to you is usually poor, a bit stupid or non-sense entirely. If you want to play this game you should probably wait a bit till it gets cheaper on gets some DLC/expansion to fix those issues. Right now I can't really recommend to buy this game at full cost. Myself I'll go back to Civ V. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've played this for about a week now on a daily basis and now feel motivated to write my first ever Steam review. This game feels like someone took the engine from Civ V, ripped out the game's soul and all the good bits. The factions are really difficult to remember - why not just have the traditional Civs in a future or alien setting? I don't really understand why the alien planets actually have to be that alien to be honest, it makes it all feel very unfamiliar and after a week, I just can't be bothered with it. All of the technologies have little made up quotes which are either boring or meaningless - why not still have real quotes from historical figures for future techs? Seeing as all techs fulfill a modern day need in different ways, I am sure this wouldn't have been impossible. Instead I have to endure groaningly bad made up rubbish. Trust me, no one would be compiling any of them into a book of quotations. I find that fact that I have to read the Civilopedia info for every item and wonder in detail to know what is going on a real chore. This game is less than intuitive. Also the wonders are far from wonderous. The diplomacy and AI is still terrible - why can't I see my resources (etc.) while in the middle of a negotiation? The tech tree is an interesting development, but that's about it. If, as others have predicted, a paid for fix to the game comes out in six months or so, I won't buy it on principle. This game feels poorly constructed and without any of the charm of the Civ series. If Firaxis can fix it and give out a free update, I may try again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Firaxis have finally played it too safe - this is Civ 5 in space, minus the later DLCs. Having taken zero risks with this title, the developers have produced  a game whose core mechanics still kind of work, but which has no personality and includes no innovation. The fact that this is basically Civ 5 is shines through in things that just make no sense in the context of the game: we can fly to another star system, but building bridges over canyons remains elusive?

The head of american illuminati corp is not a fat guy with slickback hair and a tweed suit smoking a cigarit's a puerto rican woman.Poorly enforced gender parity results in out-of-place token characters that have no personality.Previously, the exceptional narrators and other voice actors were the hallmark of any Civilization game. This time we get an ethnically ambiguous female narrator with an accent so thick that it causes physical pain. It's like having honey boo boo read the lines.The 3d artists did a truly outstanding job, especially with the trailers. Thankfully, this is overshadowed by the eye-watering ugliness of the 2d interface, icons, tech tree and civilopedia.Wonder splash screen is black and white concept art that hasn't been coloured in.Every single icon, all of the art and everything in the civilopedia is black and white.The only things coloured in are victory screens and they look like something I could draw.There are no more quotes. No Lem, no Asiimov, no Stephen Hawking, no nothing, just edgy snippets from instagram or justgirlthings.Victory screen speech sounds like the narrative to a porn film in space.The interface is an avalanche of visual clutter that is only partially oblique to make things even harder to see.Leader dialogue is always exactly the same. Each faction has exactly three unique lines, one of each: hello, trade and defeat. The rest are identical for all factions.Most all of the dialogue is a verbatim copy-paste from Civ5. I wish I was making this up.Spend most of the game re-assigning trade routes.The only promotions available from combat are +10% strength or heal instantly.Alpha Centauri had better mechanics 15 years ago (1999).They tried to innovate and it really shows, but we ended up with an unbalanced, buggy, unplayable mess.

												I'm a casual Civ fan and must say I had a good experience with this release. The key, however, was staying away from previews and reviews and letting the new additions feel like fresh experiences. It is the same formula as the rest of the Civ releases, but uncovering the new tech web, affinities and resources was a fun time. If you have played previous Civ games, don't expect a massive change. However, if you would like to see the Sid team's imagination hard at work, give this a go and you will not be dissapointed.			",122,21,1,17,15,0,25

												This is a great game if you like the Civ series, it is roughly said as a Civ set in space. One of the cool things that I like is spying. It is very handy to siphon energy or science from a rival. Even though you have a neutral releationship with him :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I gave thumb up, though it may rather be considered neutral, or even down.Here's why - as a Civ-gamer, I played all of them since the very moment of release, since Civ1 (yup, am *that* old) - EXCEPT this one. I've played on free-days only... still won't buy it...Why (even slight) positive review, then? It's a good game - PROVIDED THAT YOU DON'T HAVE CIV5 ALREADYIt's a good game - EXCEPT WHEN COMPARED TO ALPHA CENTAURIOtherwise, you may be better to wait for (at least) first expansion, which is coming out soon. This was, more or less, true for earlier Civ games (especially Civ5 and less so for others - Alpha haven't even profited from expansion).What it is?-----------Civ5 in space. Bit different graphics, some innovations, but nothing revolutionary.  Factions are bleak, and worse - a handful. Civ5 major flaws are here, too... Diplomacy even uses exact same dialogue lines...What it isn't?--------------Alpha2. With EACH faction wonderfully shade-of-gray, even dark agenda, with highly distinctive gameplay, strengths and weaknesses. With revolutionary solutions, years ahead its time...-----------So, in current state I could recommend it to newcomers or people who would like to play Civ5-in-space.For die-hard fans of Alpha, I couldn't recommend it - they are likely to find themselves disappointed or uninterested, same happened to me with Civ5 - bought it, played 10h, didn't touch it until second expansion (when huge discount influenced the decision). I don't regret it NOW, but it did took 2 expansions to get fixed...There is also a 'third group', which would have to decide for themselves, since I cannot honestly recommend either - read more reviews, forums, watch gameplay videos...----------Will expansion fix it? Well, it doesn't *look* like fix-it-all one, but then again, it's Sid Maiers company. It may surprise me yet... On a positive note, Firaxis seem to be aware of flaws, and it's kind of them to provide free-weekends for a game which received wide negative critics - hopefully, they will do the same with expansion.Don't get me wrong - I'd gladly pay full price (including the expansion) for a fully fixed game, or Alpha2 remake. Mine 'not-buying-until-it's-improved' decision is a matter of general principles and (likely) stubborness - it shouldn't stop other players.It's Firaxis game, after all, which means certain standards of quality are present - a trait which most wannabie-4X games cannot claim.Above was stated clearly which groups of player may like the game, and which may not - at least expansion-less.As for myself, I'll buy it eventually and probably play lots of it - it's just a question of time.

												I will remove/change this review when Firaxis begins to listen to their Players. After paying $40 for an incomplete game, we are again asked to shell out another $30 for a DLC that should come as an Update, as it apparently Finishes what the development team failed to do in the first place. Civ:BE has the potential to be one of the best TBS games on the market, furthermore one of the better Sci-Fi games on the market. As a Science Fiction fan, i am in love with the theme, the colors are rich, and the overall gameplay is so close to being complete it is literally annoying to play, simply because you feel that if the team took even an extra month, they could've actually put in the finishing touches, making the game what it should be. It is apparent, instead of updating the game, we will now have to purchase Beyond Earth Rising Tide just to get the game to a non-annoying and enjoyable condition. I have 155 hours clocked on Civ:5 because it is brilliant. I have 8.6 hours on this game thus far because i simply cannot sit down and play it, as i find myself just unengaged after the first 30-100 turns, depending on how idiotic our AI decide to be, you know, whether or not they decide to declare war on me for unearthing one of their precious artifacts, even though they've seemingly emptied my surrounding land of anything that had value, while I had no option but to watch from my feable and somewhat boring colony. The fact that even simple things such as changes to the Tech Tree UI are attached to the Rising Tide DLC shows that Firaxis is gobling up money faster than they can put out quality games, this is bad news for any long-term business strategies they may think they have. Figure it out, make the neccessary changes, and throw us a freaking bone!!! and I would gladly recommend this game to even my grand parents!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Firaxis seriously dropped the ball with this one.Graphically speaking, it looks lovely, a minor step up from Civ V, but only minor.Now come the problems, and this is a big and damning problem for me.The AI civs have ZERO unique traits to them.  In fact, they all behaved the same.  Not one civ would be against the aliens, every single civ would condemn or even go so far as to declare war on you for attacking aliens.So tl;dr it's not worth the money, maybe if it has an expansion that brings back unique civ AI personalities as well as fixing other issues like allegedly neutral aliens suddenly deciding they want you dead and destroying everything you ever loved...  Then maybe it'll be worth something on sale.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.  GET CIV V.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The head of american illuminati corp is not a fat guy with slickback hair and a tweed suit smoking a cigarit's a puerto rican woman.Poorly enforced gender parity results in out-of-place token characters that have no personality.Previously, the exceptional narrators and other voice actors were the hallmark of any Civilization game. This time we get an ethnically ambiguous female narrator with an accent so thick that it causes physical pain. It's like having honey boo boo read the lines.The 3d artists did a truly outstanding job, especially with the trailers. Thankfully, this is overshadowed by the eye-watering ugliness of the 2d interface, icons, tech tree and civilopedia.Wonder splash screen is black and white concept art that hasn't been coloured in.Every single icon, all of the art and everything in the civilopedia is black and white.The only things coloured in are victory screens and they look like something I could draw.There are no more quotes. No Lem, no Asiimov, no Stephen Hawking, no nothing, just edgy snippets from instagram or justgirlthings.Victory screen speech sounds like the narrative to a porn film in space.The interface is an avalanche of visual clutter that is only partially oblique to make things even harder to see.Leader dialogue is always exactly the same. Each faction has exactly three unique lines, one of each: hello, trade and defeat. The rest are identical for all factions.Most all of the dialogue is a verbatim copy-paste from Civ5. I wish I was making this up.Spend most of the game re-assigning trade routes.The only promotions available from combat are +10% strength or heal instantly.Alpha Centauri had better mechanics 15 years ago (1999).They tried to innovate and it really shows, but we ended up with an unbalanced, buggy, unplayable mess. Events are always the same. One choice always completely eclipses the alternative. Some perks are always better. Multiplayer is completely busted.

												SMAC was a game about ideas and while the affinity systems introduces a compellling raft of ideas about the future direction of humanity, they are poorly realized and the starting factors lack any distinct Earth ideologies to meld with their brave new world.Maybe after patches and DLC this game will be great but some interesting evolutions are marred by glaring problems.Pros:- Traiding for favors in diplomacy is a great addition and when a trading partner spent favors to get me to go to war.. I listened.  - The refined spy system is quite enjoyable and can form a leg of new stratagies.  Like running energy deficits made up for by periodic ""transfers"" of large energy stores- The affinity system is interesting and a believable reaction to events on Earth - though the main gameplay is lacking in backstory and writting is not as grand or artful as in SMAC- The ailens are decidely not barbarians and those who handle them as such are not really getting that they are something different and other arrangements are possible- The tech web is actually very neat and I like the non-linear progress.  I only wish thay had been more ambitious here and clearly made more of it optional for certain factors and affinities. -  The new virtures system is pretty good though prosperity is OP due to other health balance problems.  Overall, virtues are as important to overcoming the harsh planet as the tech web.Cons- No diplomacy victor and lack of luxaries means that aspect of the game is stilted as compared to Civ 5 or SMAC - a shame given the potential favors open up- Lots of visual and other small bugs- A step backwards in UI from Civ 5 with less information avalible on why things happen or what your built- AI is still terrible at war - only sheer numbers would work for it- I didn't even realize when I built my first wonder, they are underpowered and completing them feels underwhelming without any videos like in Civ 5 or SMAC- The writting is overall not very godo and this shows with both wonders and completed technologies.  Also many of the quotes don't seem to add to either factor, affinity, or the earth backstory- Default factors just aren't that interesting, it's affinities that matter-  Too many small quest decisions without a sense of direction or purpose.  I hope any building upgrade quests are just removed as they don't really add much to overall gameplay  - Buggy quests, I get quests I can never fulfill due to their requirements being impossible			",0,1,0,4,4,0,5

The aliens are pretty cool compared to the barbarians of civ 5, there are several different types and they seem to be much more intelligent than barbarians. i would still reccomend waiting for a price drop or getting it on sale as there arent many maps/playable races as of now.

												While not a drastic departure from Civilization 5 and it's DLC; Beyond Earth provides Civilization players with enough to keep things fresh. New tech trees, dynamic societal framework & interesting new units (especially satellites) are a refreshing change of pace. As well as the victory conditions; which have also been revamped.Certainly not all it could have been, but for the Civilization afficionado, very good. Let it drop in price though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I may have come into this experience with unreasonable expectations.  When I saw the trailers for ""Beyond Earth,"" I immediately got pumped for a spiritual successor to ""Alpha Centauri.""  After playing many hours of this game, I can tell you this:  Alpha Centauri, it ain't.  My main problem with the game is its drab, unengaging, and copy-pastey factions.  In Alpha Centauri, all of the faction leaders had their own goals and personalities.  The dialogue options were unique and tailored to each faction leader, and gave the single-player experience a satisfying political feel.  Beyond Earth, on the other hand, uses the same dialogue for political interactions with every faction.  Faction leaders have no personality, and as a result, dealing with a faction feels more like hitting the snooze button on an alarm clock, rather than having a wheel-and-deal with the supreme leader of a unique nation.  Additionally, the tech tree feels boring and unexciting.  Almost every technology gives you a percentage increase to military, science, or economy.  It's common to spend twenty turns researching a technology, only to find your reward being a .2% increase in faction-wide economic revenue.  In Alpha Centauri, researching a new technology could give you access to missile weapons, flight, or hovercraft.  Racing toward the Flight technology could give you a dominating advantage.  No such analogue in Beyond Earth.  It's just a boring march of percentiles.Full disclosure:  I haven't played the Rising Tide DLC.  I've been told that it fixes a lot of the problems with faction leaders, making them more unique and fun to interact with.  However, after my disappointing experience with Beyond Eath, I'm not sure if I want to sink more money into what's turned out to be a lackluster experience.  If I change my mind, I'll update this review.  As it stands, I don't recommend the game.  Firaxis is an excellent studio, and I own and enjoy a lot of their games.  This one, however, could have been done much better. ",206,59,1,30,30,5,45

												Only played it during a free weekend, but I absolutely LOVE this game. I'm a big fan of the Civ franchise, and I've been playing since Civ 3. That said, I still suck majorly at the game, I play it extremely casually (but for long periods of time nonetheless). Civ 5 is an awesome game, definitely worthy of the franchise. One of the very few things I very much dislike about the Civilization games is how you are bound to going forward in time. You can chose to start from a later age but you can't chose to stay in one age longer, except if you play marathon or epic (which I usually do) but you're still unable to achieve pretty much anything in, for instance, the archaic age, even though, playing as Babylon, I should be able to have a history-worthy empire at that time (But it's impossible) which makes civ really unrealistic - as if you can't have a big empire with lots of cities 1500 BC. Another thing that bothers me about the original game is how you're always bound to the empires of this world, and always one ruler who somehow lives for 7000 years... It would be cool if you could just make your own culture and empire, not really bound by any of the empires in the actual world so you could more realistically rewrite history. I heard many people complaining that this game is ""just like an expansion of Civ 5"". I compeltely disagree, the game is different. I played Civ 3 and its gameplay is still similar to Civ 5. It's just a weird conclusion, this game is different and it feels different to me. What I really like about it is how there are these factions that represent more developed alliances that relate to those of the present world, and that you're not really connected to history at all so many of the problems I had with the Civ games, that I mentioned above, fall away. Nevertheless, the game isn't perfect. As I played it, it seemed rather unfinished - just slightly. There could've been a lot more features and fun things in the game, more expanding on how the other nations react to you and one another, especially concerning how to deal with alien life (I really liked how they did the thing with symbiosis with alien life though) and there should be more ways to win the game, and more immersion in the world (this does count for most civ games, though. Lacks immersion. Civ 3 had this cool thing with your palace expanding if your people get happier or something. I don't know why they ever got rid of that. That's the kind of stuff that really catches my eye and gets me immersed.)Other than all that, I'm just a big fan of sci-fi. I love history, but history is written and rewriting it is awkward (americans in mesopotamia with the pyramids and the porcelain tower??) unless you would take away all the pre-determined things (like set culture, wonders. As I said, it would be awesome if we could design our own culture. Sort of like how ""Gods and Kings"" adressed religion, but very much expanded upon). Sci-Fi, like High Fantasy, however, is completely free of that. This setting, the whole emotional opening cinematic, the whole idea... It just blows my mind. This setting and theme comes very close to my ideal of the future of mankind. I said ♥♥♥♥ yes many times while starting off the game.A bummer: After playing this game for 6 hours straight I was nearing the end of the game. It was a pretty big letdown. I was very close to finishing the satelity thingy for the alien buddies victory, but someone else was ahead of me. ( a freakin NPC, I know I suck.) and the ending was very anti climatic. I loaded an earlier save later on and did it again, this time with me winning but I was still underwhelmed. The original Civ games had underwhelming endings too, I must say, but this just felt like much of the 6 hours weren't  well spent. Again, this does count for Civ 5 too, but not to such extend.Alright, so let me wrap this up. I am a crappy Civ player that only plays against NPC's and sometimes a friend of mine. I am a casual player and this was my impression of the game. I'd give it a 7/10.You don't have to take my word for it though. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: April 30, 2015
												I like the game, but I have many suggestions for new content to make it better: NEW SPONSOR-SPECIFIC UNITS: Sponsors should have exclusive units so that sponsors feel more distinct and important.  Here's some ideas:* American Reclamation Corporation (ARC): Since they are spies, give them a unit that can cloak and enter other colony borders without starting a war.* Brasilia: Since their strength is melee, give them a melee unit that specializes in killing enemy melee units.  * Franco-Iberia: Since their strength is culture, give them a propaganda unit with 5 move speed that can dash into an enemy city and reduce its defenses, based on how much culture Franco has.* Kavithan Protectorate: Since their strength is border expansion, give them a unit that gains battle bonuses for fighting inside their borders, on their land.* Pan-Asian Cooperative: Since their strength is workers, give them special worker units that have weapons.* People's African Union: Since their strength is food, give them turret units that can be built on farms for protection.  One turret per 10 hex spaces, per city (so basically, each city would have 1 max).* Polystralia: Since their strength is trade, give them units that can ""ride"" trade convoys to protect them.  Or special trade convoys with weapons.* Slavic Federation: Since their strength is orbital, give them a cheaply produced orbital weapon that can crash to deal damage. AFFINITY UNIT CHANGE SUGGESTIONS: Most affinity units are bland and weak.  I can always beat the game with Dominance Victory without affinity units.  I just upgrade regular units.  I avoid affinity units because they have low stats and quickly become outdated, especially since your regular units receive upgrades much earlier than affinity units.   You should give affinity units special abilities, so they have strategic support value on the battlefield, instead of being bland/weak.  Here's some ideas:* Abilities to give to Purity Affinity units:-AEGIS should be able to temporarily ""transform"" into a jet for increased movement and transform back into AEGIS to fight.-Battlesuits carry flags, so should provide bonus inspiration/attack to nearby allies.-LEV Tank should deal bonus damage vs mechanical enemies, like a tank is supposed to.-LEV Destroyer is sufficiently strong and the only worthwhile Purity unit.* Abilities to give to Supremacy Affinity units:-Per its name, CNDR should deal 10 burning damage to adjacent units beyond its target.-Per its name, CARVR should be able to raze a forest and turn it flat.  Though, the game description says CARVR is a recon unit, so maybe it should fire a beacon that reveals part of the map.-SABR should be able to detonate and explode to deal damage, since they are generally useless in many combat situations. SABR have 1 movement and they require that 1 movement to set up for attack, so they literally don't do anything.  You can just upgrade Rangers for the 3 attack range and Rangers have 2 movement with no set up.-ANGEL is sufficiently strong and the only worthwhile Supremacy unit.* Abilities to give to Harmony Affinity units:-Xeno Swarm should be able to convince neutral Alien units to join its swarm (absorbing the Alien), to gain permanent bonus strength like an upgrade.-Xeno Cavalry should be able to ""dash through"" enemy units that are blocking its path since they are riding an acrobatic alien!-Xeno Titan and Rocktopus are sufficiently strong.  Rocktopus is currently the only creative affinity unit. GAMEPLAY CHANGE SUGGESTIONS: * Mid to late game, there's always too many workers that you don't need.  Workers should be able to permanently ""morph"" into other units, such as a militia unit (after researching a specific tech of course).  * Explorers are useless mid to late game.  They should be able to morph into immobile sentries that grant increased vision on the map, so they are doing something useful.  * New unit:  Armored Transport Truck.  A truck with 4 movement that can hold 2 land units.  Has bonus armor, but no weapons.  After exiting the truck, the carried unit will have 0 movement (simliar to when you purchase a new unit in a city).  If the truck is destroyed, then the carried units inside are destroyed.* When you research Magrail, the Construct Road option disappears.   Let us pick between Magrail / Road; don't erase the Road option.  Sometimes, I want to construct a road because it costs less than magrail to maintain and it builds quicker.  Also, the Civilopedia needs to explain the movement bonuses provided by road and magrail (what is the exact movement fraction?  1/2? 1/3?).* Ability to settle a city lodged inside a Mountain for extra defense. * Ability to settle a city inside a Crevice for extra energy (from the planet's core).* Ability to settle a city on a Crater for extra production (from meteor fragments). USER INTERFACE CHANGE SUGGESTIONS: * Allow us to click on an enemy unit to view its stats, without having to attack it or pretend to attack it, just to view enemy unit information.   * Unit queue system: When sorting to the next unit to take its turn, the queue system should select the nearest unit to the one you just finished moving.  That way you can conduct battles and move large forces across the map with less headache.  Currently, the unit queue system, jumps back and forth across the map which is annoying.  * In the Cover Ops screen, when your agent is currently in counter-intelligence protecting your city, it should show you how much intrigue the protected city has.  Currently, you have to physically jump to your city to look at its intrigue if it's under counter-intelligence.			",12,3,0,6,4,0,11

												This game was like a shiny new amazing version of Civ 5 in which everything about it would be better than the previous game (In my mind). When in reality it was not as shiny, nor better than the previous game. It was sub-par. But like any Civ, once the DLC comes out the game will get better (because let's be honest, the DLC for Civ 5 was basically things that should have been in the game without having to pay more for it). But I still like it a smidge too much to not recommend it...			",9,4,0,1,5,0,3

												Well, where should I start. I guess I should start from the beginning. Me and my friend wanted to upgrade from civ 5 because it was getting too repetitive. We decided to buy Beyond Earth. I will not say this was a horrible choice, but people should be careful unless you know how to troubleshoot connection issues for multiplayer. We were playing 6 man games until we finished our first one. After that, any time we tried to start a new game with more than 4 people the game would seperate us into different games. With this issue, its a bit of a hassle trying to player multiplayer. After we got it to work, it was an amazing experience. 4 people is the magic number it seems, as we havent had issues after switching to 4. I reommend this game because the issues aren't too much to handle, no coding or anything to deal with. I am just saying, be careful if you expect it to always work for you because it won't.

Posted: April 30, 2015
												I like the game, but I have many suggestions for new content to make it better: NEW SPONSOR-SPECIFIC UNITS: Sponsors should have exclusive units so that sponsors feel more distinct and important.  Here's some ideas:* American Reclamation Corporation (ARC): Since they are spies, give them a unit that can cloak and enter other colony borders without starting a war.* Brasilia: Since their strength is melee, give them a melee unit that specializes in killing enemy melee units.  * Franco-Iberia: Since their strength is culture, give them a propaganda unit with 5 move speed that can dash into an enemy city and reduce its defenses, based on how much culture Franco has.* Kavithan Protectorate: Since their strength is border expansion, give them a unit that gains battle bonuses for fighting inside their borders, on their land.* Pan-Asian Cooperative: Since their strength is workers, give them special worker units that have weapons.* People's African Union: Since their strength is food, give them turret units that can be built on farms for protection.  One turret per 10 hex spaces, per city (so basically, each city would have 1 max).* Polystralia: Since their strength is trade, give them units that can ""ride"" trade convoys to protect them.  Or special trade convoys with weapons.* Slavic Federation: Since their strength is orbital, give them a cheaply produced orbital weapon that can crash to deal damage. AFFINITY UNIT CHANGE SUGGESTIONS: Most affinity units are bland and weak.  I can always beat the game with Dominance Victory without affinity units.  I just upgrade regular units.  I avoid affinity units because they have low stats and quickly become outdated, especially since your regular units receive upgrades much earlier than affinity units.   You should give affinity units special abilities, so they have strategic support value on the battlefield, instead of being bland/weak.  Here's some ideas:* Abilities to give to Purity Affinity units:-AEGIS should be able to temporarily ""transform"" into a jet for increased movement and transform back into AEGIS to fight.-Battlesuits carry flags, so should provide bonus inspiration/attack to nearby allies.-LEV Tank should deal bonus damage vs mechanical enemies, like a tank is supposed to.-LEV Destroyer is sufficiently strong and the only worthwhile Purity unit.* Abilities to give to Supremacy Affinity units:-Per its name, CNDR should deal 10 burning damage to adjacent units beyond its target.-Per its name, CARVR should be able to raze a forest and turn it flat.  Though, the game description says CARVR is a recon unit, so maybe it should fire a beacon that reveals part of the map.-SABR should be able to detonate and explode to deal damage, since they are generally useless in many combat situations. SABR have 1 movement and they require that 1 movement to set up for attack, so they literally don't do anything.  You can just upgrade Rangers for the 3 attack range and Rangers have 2 movement with no set up.-ANGEL is sufficiently strong and the only worthwhile Supremacy unit.* Abilities to give to Harmony Affinity units:-Xeno Swarm should be able to convince neutral Alien units to join its swarm (absorbing the Alien), to gain permanent bonus strength like an upgrade.-Xeno Cavalry should be able to ""dash through"" enemy units that are blocking its path since they are riding an acrobatic alien!-Xeno Titan and Rocktopus are sufficiently strong.  Rocktopus is currently the only creative affinity unit. GAMEPLAY CHANGE SUGGESTIONS: * Mid to late game, there's always too many workers that you don't need.  Workers should be able to permanently ""morph"" into other units, such as a militia unit (after researching a specific tech of course).  * Explorers are useless mid to late game.  They should be able to morph into immobile sentries that grant increased vision on the map, so they are doing something useful.  * New unit:  Armored Transport Truck.  A truck with 4 movement that can hold 2 land units.  Has bonus armor, but no weapons.  After exiting the truck, the carried unit will have 0 movement (simliar to when you purchase a new unit in a city).  If the truck is destroyed, then the carried units inside are destroyed.* When you research Magrail, the Construct Road option disappears.   Let us pick between Magrail / Road; don't erase the Road option.  Sometimes, I want to construct a road because it costs less than magrail to maintain and it builds quicker.  Also, the Civilopedia needs to explain the movement bonuses provided by road and magrail (what is the exact movement fraction?  1/2? 1/3?).* Ability to settle a city lodged inside a Mountain for extra defense. * Ability to settle a city inside a Crevice for extra energy (from the planet's core).* Ability to settle a city on a Crater for extra production (from meteor fragments). USER INTERFACE CHANGE SUGGESTIONS: * Allow us to click on an enemy unit to view its stats, without having to attack it or pretend to attack it, just to view enemy unit information.   * Unit queue system: When sorting to the next unit to take its turn, the queue system should select the nearest unit to the one you just finished moving.  That way you can conduct battles and move large forces across the map with less headache.  Currently, the unit queue system, jumps back and forth across the map which is annoying.  * In the Cover Ops screen, when your agent is currently in counter-intelligence protecting your city, it should show you how much intrigue the protected city has.  Currently, you have to physically jump to your city to look at its intrigue if it's under counter-intelligence.			",12,3,0,6,4,0,11

Posted: March 19, 2015
												Only played it during a free weekend, but I absolutely LOVE this game. I'm a big fan of the Civ franchise, and I've been playing since Civ 3. That said, I still suck majorly at the game, I play it extremely casually (but for long periods of time nonetheless). Civ 5 is an awesome game, definitely worthy of the franchise. One of the very few things I very much dislike about the Civilization games is how you are bound to going forward in time. You can chose to start from a later age but you can't chose to stay in one age longer, except if you play marathon or epic (which I usually do) but you're still unable to achieve pretty much anything in, for instance, the archaic age, even though, playing as Babylon, I should be able to have a history-worthy empire at that time (But it's impossible) which makes civ really unrealistic - as if you can't have a big empire with lots of cities 1500 BC. Another thing that bothers me about the original game is how you're always bound to the empires of this world, and always one ruler who somehow lives for 7000 years... It would be cool if you could just make your own culture and empire, not really bound by any of the empires in the actual world so you could more realistically rewrite history. I heard many people complaining that this game is ""just like an expansion of Civ 5"". I compeltely disagree, the game is different. I played Civ 3 and its gameplay is still similar to Civ 5. It's just a weird conclusion, this game is different and it feels different to me. What I really like about it is how there are these factions that represent more developed alliances that relate to those of the present world, and that you're not really connected to history at all so many of the problems I had with the Civ games, that I mentioned above, fall away. Nevertheless, the game isn't perfect. As I played it, it seemed rather unfinished - just slightly. There could've been a lot more features and fun things in the game, more expanding on how the other nations react to you and one another, especially concerning how to deal with alien life (I really liked how they did the thing with symbiosis with alien life though) and there should be more ways to win the game, and more immersion in the world (this does count for most civ games, though. Lacks immersion. Civ 3 had this cool thing with your palace expanding if your people get happier or something. I don't know why they ever got rid of that. That's the kind of stuff that really catches my eye and gets me immersed.)Other than all that, I'm just a big fan of sci-fi. I love history, but history is written and rewriting it is awkward (americans in mesopotamia with the pyramids and the porcelain tower??) unless you would take away all the pre-determined things (like set culture, wonders. As I said, it would be awesome if we could design our own culture. Sort of like how ""Gods and Kings"" adressed religion, but very much expanded upon). Sci-Fi, like High Fantasy, however, is completely free of that. This setting, the whole emotional opening cinematic, the whole idea... It just blows my mind. This setting and theme comes very close to my ideal of the future of mankind. I said ♥♥♥♥ yes many times while starting off the game.A bummer: After playing this game for 6 hours straight I was nearing the end of the game. It was a pretty big letdown. I was very close to finishing the satelity thingy for the alien buddies victory, but someone else was ahead of me. ( a freakin NPC, I know I suck.) and the ending was very anti climatic. I loaded an earlier save later on and did it again, this time with me winning but I was still underwhelmed. The original Civ games had underwhelming endings too, I must say, but this just felt like much of the 6 hours weren't  well spent. Again, this does count for Civ 5 too, but not to such extend.Alright, so let me wrap this up. I am a crappy Civ player that only plays against NPC's and sometimes a friend of mine. I am a casual player and this was my impression of the game. I'd give it a 7/10.You don't have to take my word for it though. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The biggest disappointment. A massive dropped ball. The things they could've done but instead they chose to reskin and strip out core mechanics from Civ V... probably to drip feed through as DLC.♥♥♥♥ this game and ♥♥♥♥ you Firaxis. I will be pirating the next civ game before I even think of buying it now thanks to this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.A game franchise I thought I could trust. All you game companies are just painting yourselves up to be the same.What's wrong with this game? Lack of variety, no real... civ feel. The tech web sucks, the interface sucks and the graphics for the planet sucks. The opportunity to have no realistic limit on technology, to incorporate some sort of alien interactions to the game etc... and this is the best they can do?Nah, of course not. 29.99 DLC.This game is an insult to gamers and I urge you not to pay full price for this. I'd pay max £10 in it's current state. It's a sorry addition to this great franchise and the excuse of this being a spinoff from the main civ series does not wash it's filthy hands clean.

												I've played this game a great deal, and I have to say, it just doesn't live up to snuff. It's not as good as Civilization 5: Brave New World on the strategy front, nor is it challenging or exciting. Why is it bad?- Affinity system makes beakers the *only* important resource; rush tech 100% of the time, and you will win 100% of the time- The A.I. doesn't seem to have any programming. They often just idle the entire game, while occasionally deploying a poorly organized army at you once, and then begging for your forgiveness while rewarding you with tons of favors and resources.-  The aliens don't scale; they're a challenge for 40 turns, and then they are just fodder for the rest of the game. For something to be an integral part of the game, it needs to serve some sort of purpose beyond ""Wefuxurexplorers"" for a few turns- The jumps between tech levels are too drastic; a tech 1 unit, fully leveled and with virtue support, has almost no chance of contending with a tech 2 unit; the auto-upgrade immediately happening further rewards players for fast teching, instead of making them strategically utilize their resources on a per-unit basis.- Diplomacy is a complete and utter joke. Literally the worst iteration in the franchise history, I would say.- Randomly appearing trade outposts always take up the best land spots; you have to decide whether you want their bonus, or their location for tiles... and they always spawn in between the best locations, strategically.The game has a long way to go. The only positive I can say about it is that, it's a Civ game, and they do always get better with time/expansion packs/DLC. Wait until a few patches drop and and the game is fine-tuned. In it's current state, it feels like a fleshed out, early-access game that is still months away from being a complete game			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is fantastic, difficult and challenging with a fairly open ended way to go about everything. Long gone is the linear tech tree which has been replaced by the tech web, giving you choice in the direction you build and focus your empire. But with this comes the downside of spending too much time going with whatever looks neat, and having no progression towards your ultimate victory.I can honestly see guides popping up on how to rush the right tech to the fastest victory. Anyway, Gameplay is familiar to those who have played Civ5. The atmospheric layer adds wicked little temporay bonuses to your empire, from solar collects to orbital lasers. Making it neat to play with.Diplomacy hasn't changed much, its solid with all the bells and whistles and a new Favor system. Ask for tech/trade whatever and offer favors that can be used and redeemed and it seems the AI has a harder time saying no too.Spying is actually fun now, from defending your territory, stealing tech, money, research and units. Subversion and everything in between.Speaking of units, the units in this game benefit from their own version of a tech tree. meshed with your affinity(which is chosen through tech and choices you make in the game) tech evolves into hyper futuristic stuff with wicked bonuses. gone is manually upgrading, just keep that research flowing.Barbarians have evolved into aliens and this adds a whole new dynamic, attack and wipe them out, risks bigger badder alien Xenos coming after you. or tame them, study them, and gain their abilities or outright use them.I could go on and on about this so ill focus on my own gripe at the moment.Minus a few bugs(seems the ai likes to remind you constantly of things you did ONCE) because of how the tech web is designed, it feels like the game is much shorter then other Civs, then again, I started playing at 10pm release night all the way till 5am...so maybe not so much xDI reccomend this game fully.and to anyone who says its a reskinned Civ 5.Don't fix what isn't broken			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I've played every title in the series and enjoyed them quite a bit - until this one. Civilization: Beyond Earth just plain sucks. It plays sort of like a knockoff Civ game where there are way too many aliens, other civs build right on top of you, and everything from combat to resource management just seems lacking.

												= A late bloomer but great game =159 hrs and still discovering\conquering new worlds and challenges.When this game launched it was Civ ME. The bugs were crippling and multiplayer was just plain broken. It was sad because the vision, story, and atmosphere were great. The quest, techweb, and affinity mechanics create a ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" system which allows you to truly adapt to your starting terrain and opponents. The soundtrack is epic. The achievements and units were designed by scifi fans for scifi fans.After a few major patches this game is running faster than Civ5. It's stable and immersive. Multiplayer is 95% there but 100% fun. On the harder levels the AI is pretty creative and challenging. The ""happiness-health leak"" is fixed - it matters now but it's properly measured.

												I like the new game style and find it to be refreshing change to Civ 5 But don’t buy it and expect it to play like civ 5, it doesn’t follow the traditional civ game style but rather tries to forge  its own path. I find that its  only good with the DLC that add the new civs and more game dynamic, without them the game is a bit shallow			",22,1,0,4,14,0,4

												Taking place after the events of Civlization V: The Wrath of Gandhi, Civilization: Beyond Earth follows the lives of colonists fleeing the ruin of Gandhi's Earth in search of a new home somewhere in the void of space. Upon planetfall, the colonists may decide to associate themselves with the native species, focus on technological advancements not previously possible in order to return to Earth to defeat Gandhi, or follow a much darker path... Devoting themselves to the memory of Gandhi and his empire in the hopes of one day bringing him to this new planet.Little do the colonists know that their so-called ""Progenitor"" predecessors on their new homes were actually early attempts from Gandhi to conquer other planets...

												When this was announced, I was really excited, as SMAC is one of my all time favourite games. But I remained cautious because Firaxis have this unfortunate habit of releasing a mediocre game (Civ 5) and then releasing great expansions (Brave New World) to actually make it the game it's supposed to be. It's exactly the same with this game, but it does have good points.Good: -Still extremely adddictive -Atmosphere of the alien world is well done, though the terrain gets repetitive soon-Tech web is fun for a whileBad: -Feels like a half-baked mod-Illusion of choice is EVERYWHERE... in the tech web, in the virtues, in the quests, etc. There's usually one path which is most useful. For a game built around choice, this is a huge negative-Faction leaders have no personality-No luxury resources makes settling new cities far less entertaining, and removes a big aspect of each civilization's role in the world- All the factions feel the same because they ARE the same apart from their one unique ability, which is only really felt in early game. 50-100 turns into each game, all Civs are exactly the same, with different colours.-Very very little replayability-Bored already, and I've just played 11 hours. To put that into context, I played Civ5 + expansions for over 300 hours (online and offline) and I still want to go back to that.Bottom Line: NOT WORTH BUYING AT $50, or even $30. I got it cheap here in retail for the equivalent of $20 and I still feel a bit ripped off. Just play Brave New World.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A lot of people in their reviews say that you shouldn't buy this game or wait until the first DLC (Which is October 9th, so excited for that!), mainly because ""It's a reskin of Civ 5"". But in reality, it isn't in it's own little ways.First are the aliens. They are kinda like barbarians except depending on how much you destroy their nests and a certain pace, they could be peaceful to all out death destroyers. Second, is the colonization of the planet. You start out with an area to select your first city. Which, depending on the tiles it gives you, could give you an edge against other players early on. All of the other players settle 1 player per turn and the game shows where the player's capital is, which again is cool (Everything in the game, I thought was cool.) Third, is the unit upgrades. The game provides a tech tree type deal with each military unit. Once a higher tier is available, it notifies you and you upgrade all, I mean ALL of your units in one, swift click, even if they aren't in your territory.I'm not going to state EVERYTHING there is to the game. But 12 hours into playtime on the game and still enjoying it is pretty good.  Besides, I'll let you guys figure everything else out by yourself so I don't spoil the game. It is nicer that way.10/10 I would play again.			",37,13,0,5,5,0,5

												Civilization: Beyond Earth. Cool title and a nice game. People often complain about the lack of units compared to say Civ 5 where you had 10-ish units with a dozen or so different models though the ages. I like the ""lack"" of units if you can call it that. (The basic marine has 8 models depending on perk choise and affinity level.)That said I feel there could be more variety when it comes to the alien life forms in the game. To switch things around from one game to another much like the terrain does.Combat is solid though the AI tends to be a tad crap at it. Diplomacy leaves a lot to be desired I'm sad to say.The tech web is a wonderfull idea but could use some more paint so you can easily identify what you get. (Several such mods availible in the workshop.)The one thing that annoys me is the trade convoy system. Instead of having persistent routes and a menu to manage and change these routes a treade route is permanent until the time limit for it expires after 25 turns and you have to make assign new route.That's the basic rundown of the game. I highly recommend it even with its few flaws and minimalistic GUI. I'm having loads of fun every game. ^_^			",137,20,1,42,33,0,55

												Do you guys remember Civ 5? How when it came out, all the civilizations felt the same, the diplomacy was garbage, and the game wasn't really deep at all? Welcome back to those days!Everything feels half-baked. Diplomacy is just as bad as it is in Civ 5 and I could list a dozen games that handle diplomacy better. Combat is literally the same thing from Civ 5. The affinity system is just laughably bad and uninteresting. The differences in civilzations is a minor special ability and nothing else.Much like this game, I can't be bothered to actually expand this into a full review. The short of it is that this is not a full price $50 game. Civ 5 complete, a game that is leaps and bounds ahead of this game, is the exact same price. Endless Legend is so much better and 15 dollars cheaper. If and when they expand or patch this game to make it more of a game rather than a fancy looking mod for Civ 5, I'll revisit the game and might re-review this, but until then I can't recommend this to anyone.

												I heard about this game last october before I was a huge civ fanatic. I saw on the Mac App store ( I have a 2015 mac book air) that this game was on sale! I am really into civ 5 and I love futurestic space games so I was really happy. Ok so now to the actual review part. Pros: This was a new way to play the Civ franchise and there are alot of awesome new features like the affintys, alians, upgrades that change the way a unit looks, a nice new tech style called the ""tech Web"" , quest, explorers that actually explore( the conduct expeditions!) and satalites! yes thats right, you have some space units! Cons: for what ever reason the grapics on my computer arn't the best but i can get over that, not many civs to play as, not to many core civ things( religon, great people, etc.). My over all thought: I really enjoy it! This was a really brave step for Civ to take and it is pretty origonal! The grapics on my computer are a liitle let down but the gameplay is smoth and the affintys are really cool! Affintys give you preks and change the way your units look. There is Harmony, Purty, and Supremacy. Harmony is about becoming one the the life of the planet and become friends to the alians. It also makes your units look very organic. Purty is the sad truth. Of what? that we would try to kill off all the alians and turn the world into a new earth. It is very militaristic and looks very blocky and warmongering. Supremacy is integrating tech into humans. Its kinda has the colors of the bad guys from tron and is very robotic. So yah. I recogmend this game to people who are willing to get over the fact that ist not civ 5 and except change. If you like future syci fi games or just stratagie gaes than you should get this. I think I will give thsi 8 out of 10 stars! I recogmend this game.  I hope this has helped. ",20,3,0,0,4,0,13

												This is a very good game. It has some issues, but is overall a top notch game. It definitely doesn't desvered the rating it has. The only reason so many people gave it a negative review is because they are comparing it to Civilization V. Which is ok to do I suppose, but taken on its own, this is a very good game, and in my opinion does a lot of things better than Civ V, though it does lack in some areas as well.

												(Notice: I know it says I has lack of hours, havn't played it on this account :P) Sid Meier's Civilization Beyond Earth is a solid game, while inferior to Civilization 5, it is still good. All these people were expecting some great new fantastic thing, well this isn't that. They added quests, which I think is kinda silly. The choice ones however are quite nice. Many complain that they are always one sided, but that depends on how you have played before, usually they are one sided if you play the same way everytime, which should be expected. The enviroment looks somewhat bland compared to what I would have hoped for in variety, but its still kinda neat. They game adds new challenges for you to overcome that people complain about. They hate barabrians so they replace them with neutral aliens you can befriend, then you say they suck and its boreing without constant setbacks and fighting. You hate the happiness aspect, so they replace it with a health aspect that operates similarlly, meaning you still need a focus for it, and you say its just the same thing. Well hate to break it to ya, but they can't make the game fun and realistic, easy and hard all at once, they had to find a balance point somewhere, and you people complain about everything the game has. It is a good game, not as good as civ 5 mind you, but if its on sale, and you love/ loved civ 5, this should be somewhat enjoyable. 6.7/10 ""Siege worm best feature"" -IGN			",44,3,0,8,5,0,9

												I recommend this game for many reasons, simplicity, ease of play, creativity, KRAKENS!!!!!!!! But, seriously. This game is in its first release stages, no one should judge it against Civilization 5's recent updates and DLC's because it simply is not there yet, but in my mind, this ticks my box as being a sci-fi lover. Since playing Civilization 5, I had hoped future technology would have given me something like in this game, or XCOM units were like these, but in the end that would have been highly unrealistic even at the time period.To sum up my likes and dislikes.Likes: (1) This game has multiple choices for civilizations, and allows you to choose what they were allowed to be, scientists, civilians, etcetera. (2) The units are very versatile in this game, allowing for purity, harmony and the other one (Poor memory kicks in on the killer robot, golden metal looking dudes who like invading earth.) None the less, it does allow you to choose your own story when you are making a new civilization or race if you go harmony or cyborg killer robot yellow people. (3) Satellites are the biggest improvement; sure, you have ICBMS in Civilization 4/5, but laser firing satellites? This is where I hope someone makes a mod for the Hyperion moon base.Dislikes/Improvements:(1) I have had a few issues with bugs, crashes and such, nothing what can't be fixed with a patch, no biggy.(2) Techs take too little time to research, maybe instead of a branch like that; have the ordinary tree back, with a row allocated to each type of technology?(3) DLC needs to include more actual civilizations, or maybe sentient aliens, better character models, and more units, a lot more, maybe another victory type and unit branch like annihilation(4) I would enjoy seeing an improvement to the aliens, they are far too weak for my liking, and they should be something you do not want near you just in case, maybe also a random event such as say... When mining, because of the harmony victory needing a link to the planet (Avatar style) the aliens go into a frenzied state because of the damaged eco-system. (Unless this already happens, if it does ignore me, I just kill them without care. lol)(5) Extreme need for a customizable system to make your own race and such, perhaps a pre-loaded set of icons and a choice of character model, your own name, coloured units. (6) Better or more profitable uses for energy, I didn't use energy because I was not tempted nor nearly wanting to use it, me being me, I am a bit of a tight♥♥♥♥♥when it comes to buying or paying out for stuff. I believe in reserve counter measures and the teachings of Sun Tzu. (Does not build builders, just steals them.)To be honest, people who whine about the game being unbalanced just are not using the advantages of the current time to their advantage, the key to victory is to seek the enemies’ weakness, their disadvantages, be it unfair, but that is how war is won these days, be it political or physical. Civillization beyond Earth is a step into unknown territory in sense to the others. Comparing Civ BY to Civ 5 is like comparing a brand new house to a house that has been lived in for ages; the new one is going to need improvements and such to make it look great. Whereas the old house is, going to be a house that usually already looks great and furnished because it has had time put into it over time. It is simply unfair.I know, this sounds stupid and silly, but I have a point. I will put it in simple terms. Buy this game, respect that it will not be as good as all of the others.If you don't want an unfinished, or better put, not quite fully outfitted, don't buy it, simple as, no need for people whining about the game being unbalanced, it's only been out for a couple of weeks, if you bought it thinking it would be balanced and perfect then that's your own fault. :PSo to simply put it, this game nearly ticks all my boxes. 7/10!

												Im just going to put this out there beccause after reading the first 40 reviews I have noticed a trend. The people who dont reccomend the game ( out of the 40 i read mind you) were throwing tantrums. The people who reccomend the games actually go into why its flaws are flaws and what is inherently wrong with the game. They reccomend the game even after all the harsh criticism they gave because they personally enjoyed it. So to all future reviewers just don't be a whiney brat. actually spend time playing the game and make an informed introspective of why the game is good or bad instead of the examples I will provide of the poor reviews.1 I wasted my money. I wanna be cool and bash the game like the other kids to fit in.2 It should just be a mod or dlc. I clearly have no idea of what the process of making a game is.3 Its not like alpha centauri. Help! I don't like change. its beyond me and frightens me.4 Civ 5 the game thats been out for several years and has a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of dlc is better than the game that literally just came out.and there you have it, thats the 4 general opinions of the not recomended with an addendum of how I saw each of those as I read them. Not all of the not recommended views are this poorly thought out. some of the reviews actually have coherent thought and defend their opinions. Its just most don't, and those are evil because they prevent actual information for those looking to buy the game.Thank you for indulging in my rant about proper reviewing.			",193,41,0,53,15,1,22

												This review comes from someone without an Alpha Centauri background.It isn't the same game as Alpha Centauri, quite unfortunately, so I would not have the chance to discover Alpha Centauri features from it. ;) Beyond Earth begins as an excellent title.It bears nice and original features, among which are:- startup choices, like picking your sponsor, colonists, equipment,- new planet configurations and resources,- orbital actions,- unit upgrade trees,- affinities,- new technology grouping and aspects.- decisions, quests and quest events! The UI is well made, and although the game relies very heavily on Civ 5 mechanics, it still bears some flavour like whole new techs, units and mechanics.All these reagents could mix up for a tremendous result!Alas, it fails to do so.WHY DOES IT FAIL?First, although having the potential for a truly excellent title, it doesn't go far enough in terms of original mechanics.We are very far from an Alpha Chentauri or spin-offs like Colonization. It is as if the game designers were shy or told not to go far from Civ 5. It does build interesting aspects from the Civ 5 formula, but never goes far in terms of content or how these are used within the game.You must remember that in Colonization, your population was entirely made of specialists, and each specialist used and produced various resources which could be exchanged with the Old World. New people could be trained in new specialties. As you guess, Beyond Earth has nothing of that.It begins simple, and stays simple.....It is as if the gameplay was heavily dumbed down for a reason I can't understand myself.Below follows a number of examples.QUESTS...There seems to be dozens of them available, each with their own text, flavour and reward.Quests and decisions are nice decisions, and these events also occur randomly. However, this content is used with major restrain.The bonuses are minor, the decisions almost automatic, and the player (I was almost calling him ""user"") quickly feels not as involved as he could be. Quests then end up as ""almost useless micromanagement"" instead of tough decisions, objectives and rewards.TECHS ...Another example are the techs.Techs are now made of groups (called ""hubs"") and the game proposes an interesting mechanic in how you explore these tech groups.Although the new tech grouping is interesting, but without the content to use this feature in a good way. As a result, your research goal is foggy, your direction unclear, and deprived of a strong theme it could have. Adding foggy victory objectives doesn't improve that feeling.UNITS ...First, you should note that there is a very limited number of possible ""base units"", and a larger number of balanced ""upgrades"" that these units can have. Units can be upgraded according to several paths, and these paths are exclusive.However, when they added that feature, they also removed all promotions (the available promotions in BE are almost as weak, common and uninspired as they could be) and all building requirements. This ends up in a very limited number of generic units that you will build in just about every game.Like in other Civ games, the number of civ-specific techs and units is also extremely limited (as in: none or almost none).Upgrades decisions are also nearly automatic, so you won't feel involved in them.Combat behaviour doesn't change that, and promotions fail to make your units as unique as they should be. The planet landscape although fails to provide interesting tactical options, as it feels like an earth planet with movement restrictions.AI ...Like on other major 4X titles of 2014, the AI is quite poor, very passive, and utterly unchallenging.It seems that our current waves of engineers and developers can't deliver more on the AI ground; you will have nothing like the challenges of old. Maybe we human players are more clever than before? I do not think so ... END RESULTI could go on of course.When you add the potential of the great modding tools of Civ BE, it could still end up in great contents and enjoyment to have with the game. I would definitely recommend the game for the mods that would exist.Unfortunately, as of now they do not exist. I think I should mainly review the ""base game"".I end up not recommending the game, despite its great quality in terms on UI, and despite its modding tools and possibilities.I would end by saying that Beyond Earth is an excellent title, but featuring a poor and uninspired content.There is flavour, these is a strong theme, there is the feeling of a true space adventure.There is a strong ""one more turn"" gameplay ncentive.They succedded in that.But is they failed in providing content that will make the player feel involved.You want to play ""one more turn"", but in the end, you certainly feel that you would never play ""one more game"" of Civ BE. This is what makes me not recommend the game.A poor game's content built over a quality UI and great expectations makes Civ:BE ends up as a current ""failure"". But watch out for the mods :)Many developers are making new mods for the game, as the game really needs them. And I foresee a nicer future for the game once they are done.			",212,89,3,68,37,3,97

												I love this game, people seem to forget. It's a BASE GAME. Has anyone remembered the previous Civilization base games? They lacked in depth and were boring, this base game has just as much, maybe even more content compared to the Civ V base game. Though this one lacks in depth, it does have  a lot more depth then it's predecessor. They have brought back things like caravans/caravels, ideologies (affinities), and more from Gods & Kings and Brave new World. The graphics are stunning and the game really makes your economy a crucial part of your game, your civ relies on diplomacy and trade routes to keep and create a great economy. You are now able to exchange things for favors, these favors can be later traded in for energy, cities, and can influence other people to make peace and go to war. You are also able to trade science per turn. Overall, Beyond Earth is an amazing game, with much more content and adds much more enjoyable content in this installation of the Sid Meier: Civilivation series.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I can not recommend this game unless you are a great fan of the civilisation series.Besides the nice graphics (for civilisation terms at least) this game implements many new things and approches to the game, but they are implemented very sloppy, the game does not feel thought through or really polished.In CIV 5 you had a thought out tec tree and civs and leaders.Quotes from various famous persons in the history gave an epic feeling.With all the expansions you had, faith, trade, expansion, military conflicts through the epocs or culture and what not.I do not think that Beyond earth is a bad game, it just feels unpolished and unfinished and not clear or thought out and I really hope that I do not need to buy 1-2 expansions to get this game really playable.I think a price of 50€ is extreme for a game that does not really offer more then many indy games.If the game gets on sale for 30@ it would be okay to buy but 50€ is a cheat for this content, but as a fan of the serien I will play it eitherway for hours and hours to come.

												An unsure ""Yes"" with some hope.Now, with about 14 hours of gameplay, it's time to tell community what I think of Civilization: Beyond Earth (BE).In a phrase, a big disappointment, but with a healthy expectation. A triple-A title from triple-A producers and publishers, and, yet, an unpolished experience. Maybe it's human nature to expect past performance as future behaviour.I felt the same thing when Civilization V went out. After dozens of hours on its predecessor, it was a underwhelming experience. After Gods and Kings and Brave New World, though, it was a prime experience that got 1/4th of all my gameplay hours last year. This is the base for my good feelings about this unfinished game.When I have a new game on library, I wait friday, buy a bag of chips and some sodas and, after work, experience it. This time, I was out of chips and drinking the soda disappointed with the game that cost me 1/3rd of weekly pay. The familiar systems of Civ V were there: policies, research and gold (energy), happiness (health). Not a big change on those. The nice advisor was a good thing, but on second play, you'll want that he shut up for good. The voiceovers are poor, and sometimes, glitched. There is no variety. UI and colors are dull. For a genre that has a tradition of long hours of gameplay, it's difficult to get attached to ""endless gray"". The cities are nice, but the wonders... are just blueprints. I expected nice videos, or even beautiful and meaningful slides, but all that I get is a unfinished project. An idea? Get blueprints when starting a wonder, and a marvelous image of it when it's done. With my soda, I built the Stellar Codex, and my reaction was... take another sip and cry. Of boredom.Same thing when my civilization went Purity; an advertised feature, but too much cosmetic, too little immersion. The quests are great, but they will need updates so we don't get used, and bored, for a feature. Say the same for the aliens: I expected different aliens and behaviour for different planets. So, even a fungi world is teemed with buglike creatures? I was amazed with the first contacts, but after some hours, it was only ""that scorpion-shaped ranged alien, again"". Aliens are just glorified barbarians. I expected then to act as a global city-state, with objectives and intelligence. AI and diplomacy are also the same, with poor decisions: after all, how much 1 science is worth in energy? I have no clue, and don't want to do the math. I do math at my work all week.The background history is there, but you'll have to carve it out of the Civilopedia. It's something that was great to read, but is almost a secret. It's okay that in a game like Civ V we know human history, and on Civ BE, we are making something new, but I would like to see more of it at questlines.It just begs for some big expansion - DLC's won't do any magic here. It's a great engine, we all know it from Civ V, but is was put in a coma state. Enemy Within, the expansion for XCOM is a nice remainder of what Firaxis can do: 48 maps! Sidequests! New systems! I'll continue to play, after all, it's a mixture of sci-fi with future history, something that I've waited for a long time. But I expect changes, and believe that producers and publishers will hear us. Don't mess up the franchise, boys and girls! Just give us, long-time and devoted players, the experience as it was meant to be.***************************************************************************************Bottom line: 5/10Gameplay: 6Replaybility: 5Stability: 6Controls and Interface: 4Music and SoundFX: 4Graphics and System Requirements: 7 Value range (price, average price of direct competitors) divided by (expected playing time): $ (1 of 3) Learning curve: Just RightFun Factor: =) =) (2 of 3)Immersion: medium			",47,7,1,6,22,1,42

												There are two main issues with this game. Firstly, it's basically DLC for Civ 5. The base game wasn't any good and this new skin doesn't do anything new to impress me. Sure, it reskins a bunch of tiles and units and adds orbitals, with a new tech tree. Yeah, those sound like overarching changes... except when you realize that every DLC for Civ 5 does the same thing. It's Civ 5 in space, and not very compelling at the price of a full game. Steeply discounted, if the only thing you wish you had more of in your Civ 5 was space... sure, go for it. Not my cup of tea but for the right person, absolutely.The other issue is that this game is to Alpha Centauri what Civ 5 is to the rest of the Civ series: that is, a poor approximation. You'd think after decades of technology and publishing experience Firaxis would be able to improve on a game from the early 90s, but they didn't. I am not saying this with rose-tinted glasses. After playing Beyond Earth, I actaully reinstalled Alpha Centauri to see if my fond memories were an illusion; to see if I was being unfair to this new installment in the Civ franchise. Nope. Alpha Centauri plays like a dream, even nearly 25 years after the fact. And the sad thing is that Beyond Earth really doesn't do anything new and interesting that Alpha Centauri doesn't already do. In fact, Alpha Centauri is a more full-featured game than Beyond Earth is, ~25 years later. That alone is a huge disappointment.This review is being made for the base game of Beyond Earth. I've been so disappointed by the Civ franchise's releases since Civ 5 that it has become increasingly unlikely that I'll purchase any of their future games. They had their heyday, and now their output quality has gone the way of a 70-year old street hooker's sexual desirability; it's still on the street corner for a desperate pickup, but it's really not worth any decent prospector's valuable time.

												--- EARLY RELEASE REVIEW ---so far the fith installment in the CIvilization series has played exactly how I expected it which is mainly a postivive thing.Civ6 picks up exactly where Civ5 left in the franchise, with the mechanics the same core at heart.Civ6 to me is what Civ5 was on release it has the features and the engine, it just needs the final touch ups to make it a great game like the DLC did to Civ5.to many fans of Civ5 this could seem just like a retexture with an amazing tech-tree which to be frank it pretty much is but thats not entirely a abd thing with Civ being an amazing game in the first place. to people new to Civ I highly reccomend this as even an introduction into the series.7/10			",45,2,0,3,5,0,3

I do not recomend this game all of the factions feel the same. The technology is chaotic without a feel of structure. The game is driven down only 3 seperate plays paths with 6 endings.Units capabilites are virtualy the same across all factions.The graphics feel average at bestAutomated Worker units and explorer just stop every so often, so much so that I manually manage them and its a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥Their are long stretched of time where are your are doing is pressing the ""next turn button"" and waiting for turns to complete.Near end game turns can take as long as a minute for all the factions to be processedThe satelite map is obtuse and hard to use.Trade is way to powerfull. so mush so if you dont do it you are not going to be able to win.I might give this another chance after I see some fixes and or some more content. I am hoping for some user generated content to save this... which is sad for a $50 game.			",1125,347,33,166,124,12,220

												  Having calmed down its time to write a review.  This is like a semi skilled mod team (by the usually high standards of civ modders) has taken Civ 5 and polished out a few of the flaws.   If your expecting the sucesssor to alpha centauri forget it, this is to AS as Civ 5 is to Civ 4 a dumbed down polished turd.  There is no unit customisation as in AS, the oposing civs are bland and lack personality and have worse AI than is usual for a Civ game.  For a free mod it would be great, as a DLC acceptable for a stand alone game its a partial mod of civ 5, they havent even bothered to change the diplomacy text.  Having paid £25 for this I feed cheated, have to admit its not the deep dissapointment I felt with Civ 5 but in comparing a new world with Alpha Centauri you get the same feeling of wtf are the developers thinking of (well apart from ££ We'll get more of the loyal idiots money if we release it as full game (just like the logic that if we dumb the game down its easier to program as well as we can get money from more people$$.  If you have Civ 5 then its not that much of an improvement don't bother getting this (at least till its <£10, if you don't have civ 5 go buy Civ 4 and play with mods or go for the original Alpha Centauri both are deeper and more engrossing games.

												A nice Civ clone, that is exactly that. This is identical to Civ 5 with a reskin and a couple of minor mechanical changes. It feels a lot like a mod. However, it is fun, and will absorb many hours of your time as this series is famous at doing. The Sci-fi setting is more my style than the 'historical' setting of the usual Civilization games, so I appreciate that. It is worth the full price only if you do not already own Civ 5 and some of the expansions, because it is fundamentally the same game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This should really have been an expansion to Civ V. It lacks enough good, individual features to make it a unique Civilization game, and the technologies and buildings don't really mean anything - they are simply names and descriptions, without any character. Despite all this, it is quite fun to play, and despite other reviews, it feels to me a lot less buggy and more smooth compared to Civ V. The voice acting is supurb, and the premise is very interesting.			",15,3,0,4,3,0,4

												Definitely a beautiful game with lots of different story directions.  However, I personally found the actual gameplay very repetitive and boring, somehow.  Honestly, the much cartoonier Civilization Revolutions was dramatically more fun, despite the more limited progression options. I truly enjoy this style of game, normally, and own many.  Few have this level of depth in narrative, but the gameplay doesn't pull you into the story the way it should.  Options with supposedly big consequences storywise end up being simple ""a or b"" choices based on the actual gameplay effects, which are minimal. I was wary of paying full price for this one due to the mixed reviews, and I now know why they were so negative. Worth picking up on sale only.			",70,70,0,22,22,0,18

												This, just like any Civ game so far, is interesting only until you have learned all the rules. Then it becomes repetitive. The biggest failure of the whole series is the battle system. It was corny in the beginning, it is corny now. I don't mind researching, diplomacy, building and so forth, but a game should have a bit more action than a short animation after which one or both opponents are damaged, or one of them is dead. I mean, now that it is possible to set up actual battles (since maybe 2005 or so), why haven't the Firaxis people spiced the games up a bit? At least a separate battle board where there would be some tactical possibilities? I'm not talking about huge effects but at least some added tactical interest to the battles since the game has military units in it.I would keep the campaign map neat and simple, and I would make it look big, map-like, instead of the way it is now: a toy landscape. Then I would set up a battle system - no matter what kind of system, but such that the player has more control over the outcome than just ""who has the biggest gun wins"" or some rock-paper-scissors type of thing. Believe me Firaxis - you would even play the game yourselves then.That said, this game is no worse than Civ 5 in any way, although not as large in scope. For the price I paid for it it's pretty OK for a couple of days' playing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This new game seems  much harder than the previous Civ 5 game. I manged to get an ""Emancipation Victory"" on Vostok difficulty, but it wasn't easy and took me several attempts. I can put my victory down to having a starting area which was within reach of all major strategic resources, continual use of new orbital feature, constant covert operations to steal energy. jumping around research tree to maximize affinity and build options.Overall I can say I had an enoyable time playing and the new features are good enough to justify buying the game.The one critisicm I have is that when you get a ""Victory"" you get a very poor ending , a simple splash page and a small paragraph. The game needs a short animation for each victory type.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It was a nice idea but I feel like they strayed too far away from what made Civ 1-5 good. The faction system was a cool idea but having it implemented via the tech tree, in my opinon, was a poor decision. Not a fan of the new unit upgrading system either as there's a huge imbalance once you get ahead by a single upgrade. I feel like they tried to fix what wasn't broken in Civ 5 and the result was Beyond Earth.4/10Not worth buying, I'd recommend just playing Civ 5 with mods if you want a space themed Civ game.

												First game finished, using my normal Civ Settings, map as big as possible and everything as slow as possible, but with a mid range difficulty so I could learn my ropes (mercury, what kind of name for a difficulty is that?). Slightly over 1600 turns before victory, should have upped the difficulty (I should have known that) as it was not really hard anytime.It is a very nice hack of Civ V, I like the differences that are and not disliking anything special. The units are really cool and there are nice presentations and even a cut scene or two.It is not an experience as it was to play Alpha Centauri, but perhaps  thats me and not the game, a bit dull sometimes and really just a Civ V version, but a nice one.I was good enough for me to buy the expansion and then starting a new game ASAP, so that must mean something.

												I think I have played all civilization games and their derivatives since I fell in love with the original Microprose game. I have been a great fan of the franchise and the direction they have taken for their turn-based strategy philosophy through the years.I really wanted to like this game, and it was one of the releases I was anticipating. But it failed to deliver. It is not exactly a bad game. It is just more like an extensive mod of Civ5 than an original. Also, if you are playing in Linux/OS X, it is currently playable but very buggy.If you are thinking of buying this game but haven't played Civ5, by all means, buy that one instead. And if you really want a SciFi-themed civilization game you'd be better off re-playing the very dated but still good Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri, or trying the excellent Galactic Civilizations franchise (no relation to Sid's games, but that doesn't stop them from being great).

												I tried it and have to say, this might be the worst game i've played since a long time. Not even the very basics are done right. I can only see it as some fancy graphics game. First of all NOTHING MAKES SENSE. Literally nothing. I couldnt even figure out what I was doing, why I was doing that or how It was supposed to work. I mean its nice to be able to click random buttons with fancy graphics and all but there is totally no structure in the tutorial or even the gameplay itself without knowing perfectly how the game works or having pressed buttons for years and watching what would happen. The explanation what each function does is more of a bed-time story than a short elaborated piece of info which describes what function does what, why and how.It might be true that the game might be fun and addicting once one gets to know it, but I got bored to tears before I even understood what I was doing. People are saying you should try civ 5 before beyond earth, but I'm afraid it civ 5 also might fail as hard as this game.P.S. for the people saying this game is about patience and whatnot, I have hunderds of hours in games like AoE,  EE, RA1/2/3 and many more.

												For the current state of this game, I can only recommend it to CIV fans, however not to conservative ones. Singleplayer looks poor compared to CIV 5 BNW. However this is not CIV 6, and this was told us by developers! The concept is different, game looks more like a modern version of Alpha Centauri. There are a lot of problems like multiplayer, weakness of AI, etc. For sure a lot of work is to be done in future, but for those who expect this game to be much better than CIV 5 BNW, i can say its not that easy, at least just because devs have made a lot of effort improving CIV 5, if this game would be much better, then this will mean CIV 5 BNW isn't that good. So this game looks for now mostly like an alpha-version and need player's help to develop, usually these games are now marked so in Steam. Hopefully it will change and become more replayable and challenging. Before you buy, preferably to watch some let's plays on youtube, especially end stages, so you can clearly see what are you going to do playing it. This way you hopefully won't blame developers THAT much...			",146,21,0,21,42,0,95

												I like this game. I like it a great deal It is not without its difficulties nad challenges, but as several people have said before, if you look at where Civ V is today (the game from which this one got its skeleton), its clear that Firaxis still knows how to put together an excellent and lovingly balanced game.I'm not entirely sure Civ: BE is there quite yet, but it is still quite fun. In addition, the things it does well are done beautifully.Tech Tree:The tech tree is rich, and it is wide. This means that you have to specialize to develop towards your victory strategy, and that you will be leaving things out as you do so. The way that they have the military units implemented do an excellent job of rewarding your choices rather than punishing your shortfalls. In addition, the ""Steal tech"" option is always valuable, as there is no way  that you have researched even all of the second ring of tech by the end of the game, so a little bit of free midrange tech is a nice little reward.Culture Tree:Again, they did an excellent job of rewarding your choices,  whether you choose to specialize or generalize. Every tree has rewards after so many virtues are unlocked, and every virtue tier has rewards for the same, regardless of which tree those virtues are in.Military:Units never obsolete, and the affinity paths that you choose (be they specialized or broad) allow you access to powerful benefits for the core units as well as affinity-specific units which further have some benefits for developing a secondary affinity. Fewer overall core units, but more choices than Civ.Overall, I think this is a very good start. If Civ: BE gets the same degree of attention that the Civ V series has over the past couple years, I think that the things that really make it shine today will be the very things that will make it an overall richer game than Civ V is today.

												Some small additions to the Civ V mechanics,  but it is not different enough to be enjoyale to play the game again.  If anything the arbitrary ordering of the tech web is far more apparent with no historical veneer and makes even the predecessor less fun in hindsight.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Played it for free, and as an old Alpha Centauri veteran, I wanted to like this game, but I just couldn't. It just feels so bland. There's very little to discover, and pretty much all of it is just recycled assets from Civ 5. The gameplay is even simpler than in the mother game. There's no happiness, there's just health. That means there are also no luxury resrources. There's just natural resources that add food, production, science, culture and energy, and strategic ones which I have no use for even by turn 200. The AI wants them, but I don't know what it does with them. It keeps offering me favors in return, which sounds better than just asking them for free, but the difference is cosmetic. The AI still has nothing I'd want, so I just keep stockpiling favors I can't use.It feels like an incomplete game. The pacing just isn't there. Outside of warfare, there isn't a lot to do. As a peaceful player who would very much like to coexist with the aliens, the experience is disappointing. It's cool that the aliens will be mainly peaceful, but defend their nest if I stray too close. But even with a relatively high Harmony Affinity, the aliens still keep attacking, and I don't know if I should be exterminating them. The game just doesn't tell me. Though Alpha Centauri's storyline was common for all factions, very basic and always the same, it sucked me into the game. It told a story of me, getting to know this new planet, my new home, and dealing with its own rules of nature. Beyond Earth does none of that. It just drops you into Civ 5 with some reworked rules and tells you nothing about them.There is a cool idea where you can specialize your buildings once you build them. You are given options to choose from that add extra functionality for the rest of the game. But the choice feels rather thin, especially if Health is one of the choices. My first game failed, because even though I was doing pretty good, my Health was plummeting as my cities grew and as a consequence, city growth and culture began to stagnate. The game didn't tell me how to fix it. It didn't even seem to think it was important to notify me that I should do something about it. Instead, it kept pestering me about stuff it had already told me dozens of times. ""Do you want to create trade routes?"" Still no thanks. ""Your explorers have found something."" Yes, I know, thank you.If you compare this to civ 5 mods that are freely available, I really could not justify a full pricetag. It's basically a reskinned Civ5 with a few alterations. And I have this nagging feeling that it feels incomplete, because it was incomplete on purpose to gradually improve it with expensive DLC, just like Firaxis did with Civ 5. I think I'll just wait a few years until the game is really finished and buy it on sale. Firaxis, get your act together.			",30,12,0,5,5,0,9

												I preordered BE based on my experience with Civ 5 and SMAC hoping for the same enjoyment level.  Sadly, I was disappointed.  For me the game visuals are too dark, the tech web is confusing, and too much depends on a fairly rare mineral that is nothing more than a plug for the publisher (firaxite).  I still haven't been able to build the mind flower.  The game says it is the culmination of several techs but it is not on the tech web.  So what techs does it require?  In one game I had almost every tech researched and still did not have the option to build the mind flower.  A little more indication of what is needed would be nice instead of forcing the human player to stumble around in the dark while the AI knows exactly what to do would be nice.I have played this game several times and even won one.  As with most (all?) of this type of game the human player isn't even playing in the same physical reality with the AI factions.  The AI can build faster, research faster, and apparently is not encumbered by ""fog of war"" or economic limitations on the size of their military as the human player is.  I know the devs claim this is because the AI is basically ""dumb"" and needs these advantages to be challenging but I think it is laziness on the part of developers.  They can program a rover to roam Mars and do detailed scientific studies, they should be able to program a game so the human player can feel like they are playing in the same physical universe.I am not as enthusiastic about this game but it does offer some different ey candy and is enjoyable to some extent.  Just don't expect the polished experience of the Civ series of SMAC.			",14,10,0,4,13,0,7

												This game was tremendously fun.  I enjoyed being able to play a civ game with modern seeming military units right out of the gate.  I thought the game play was entertaining and immersive, with an interesting story.  The aliens were a fun variation on the theme of barbarians.  I really loved it.Complaints:  It was a little difficult to tell what the opponent civs relationships with one another were, at least until I realized what the little colored pips next to the leader pictures represented.Honestly, the affinities didn't seem to offer any real distinction between paths of development, it was mostly a matter of appearance.  Also, the victories all seemed sort of like palette swapped versions of the same thing.  That being said, they were pallet swapped really well, and I enjoyed the ideological decision making that went into playing out the victory.Loading screens had no sort of progress indicator.  I realize that these things are often more of a placebo for waiting than an actual indicator of progress, but they do serve to let you know that the computer isn’t locked up doing nothing.  Civ always had something to let you know that it was working during load times, it was a bit neglectful to just leave the thing sitting at the load screen artwork with no explanation.Lastly, I had a really hard time understanding why I could or could not start a trade route.  In fact, the whole trade system seemed really opaque.  That may just be me being dense, thoughStill, the game was both beautiful and fun to play.  I recommend it heartily.   ",2,4,0,14,0,0,2

												After being super excited to finally be playing something that Alpha Centauri began, I must say I'm quite dissapointed. The game starts off typical Civ fashion, but then brings in AC type landscapes with a weird tech web that doesn't seem to mesh well at all.It was fun for the first couple of turns, but severely lacks the ""oomph"" factor that AC or post DLC CIV5 had. I feel as if this game is suffering a similar fate as Rome II did (but without the bugs), waiting for the ""Gold Edition"" or whatever complete version to fix or complete the game they undoubtedly are going to release.The game doesn't feel complete. It's as if you are paying for a demo and are waiting for the optional (but really required!) addons/dlc to really make the game fun.Call it greed or laziness, but I think they missed the mark. Hopefully the ""gold edition"" or ""game of the year edition"" or whatever can make this game work.TL;DR: Stick with CIV5 or Alpha Centauri.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I dont understand why so much people dont recommend this game. -A posibility is cause they played Civ 5 and just dont think.The Review has 2 Parts: The positives and nagitives - and a commend why to the downvotes.1st Part:Pros: +Cool Graphics+Affinität+Freedome in Tech Tree+Upgradable Units with your Stile+QuestsNeutral:+-Better Multiplayer as Civ 5, but not good enough. (It makes twice as funn together)Cons:-You can auto attack Units if you have no Vision to a field and run into an Alien for example.2cnd Part: Civilisations Beyond Earth is a great Game with cool Graphics and features. Firaxis made somthing new and intestring, whats worth to play. And for all who played Civ 5 and dont recommend this game - Think about Civ 5 WITHOUT mods and expansions. Is Civ 5 still better? -The expansions for this games are comming but not avabile yet.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I haven't played Civilization V or IV for that matter, so I'm not going to recommend or not Beyond Earth based on how it compares to these games. Last Civilization games I played were Alpha Centauri and a little bit of Civilization III. I played Civilization II for countless hours when I was younger. Beyond Earth is basically to Civilization V what Alpha Centauri was to Civilization II and it shows. It shows in the land features such as ""Miasma"" (blue) instead of ""Xenofungus"" (pink).The Good:There are no more governors to deal within the cities you build. That might seem like something that would increase micro-management, but it isn't. The way this was automated is simpler, you don't have an incompetent governor deciding to build scrap anymore. You simply set the focus of the city and fill its build queue to your desire. These 2 activities are not without their frustrations, but I find that I do a lot less micro-management with the simplest way of addressing a problem.The difficulty levels seem to have been tuned down a bit. When I use to barely be able to play at Warlord in Civ III with normal game parameters, Beyond Earth offers a kinder difficulty curve and I was able to beat it at its worst.The upgrade system for units has been greatly simplified compared to Alpha Centauri and that's a time sink which is appreciatively gone. The upgrade system features 3 affinity branches with 3 levels of upgrades per units and 2 choices per level to make. What's better than before is you don't have to spend coutnless hours upgrading and designing new units. The upgrades are applied instantly. Same Old Civ:The AI is still completely wacko. One turn it might decide that you're great enough for an alliance and the next it just declares war for no apparent reasons. That's the usual Civilization knowledge base. The AI just evaluates its decisions based on very slim criteria which may or may not make sense. For instance, if you play on a tiny map versus a single AI opponent, it may effectively ask you to never buy any land because it is too close to its territory.Diplomacy is still lacking. The AI can insult you, but you can't insult anyone. Overall diplomacy in Civilization has always felt like 2 robots talking to each other and Beyond Earth is no different. I find the constant harassment of AI players asking for resources in return of favors to be ultimately worthless as far game experience goes.  The Bad:Setting the focus of a city and build queue would be great if the UI wasn't complete trash. There's just too much clicking to go around this interface. For example, to setup the build queue, first you need to activate it with a check box, then you need to click on add queue, then you fill it. If you want to convert production, you have to uncheck the activate check box, then click on choose production. If you want to remove a convert production, you have to make sure the activate check box isn't on. It's very tedious.The diplomacy UI is also just as horrible as the city management screen. Options show up the list which you just can't pick because of some precondition not meant. Too many times I just tried to pick those just to find out they're actually disabled.To conclude, Beyond Earth is 6-7/10 depending on how much of a fan of the series you are. Most of the flack I would throw at it comes from the UI and the user experience. There's also a few bugs here and there on SteamOS. Still, I find no problems in recommending this game. Even with its problems, it's still fun to play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game looks good, but then you play it and realize its still like a beta. There aren't even scenarios yet. The game is over priced and even discounted at 30 is still a waste. The game also only has 8 civs to choose from, but the community has already added some creative ones. The reason I like it is that is has great potential and I would like to see some great mods from the community and creative expansions from the developers.EDIT 8/25/15This game hasn't changed at all in a year. The new DLC looks like something that should have been included in the main game. Also it sounds like they don't even want you to use the new water cities by making AI agressive toward them and there are more sea monsters that can destroy them. The new units just seem like a pathetic attempt to add unit diversity to the game. I don't think this game is worth it and would love a refund.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I think Civ:BE has a lot of potential. It is regretable that the gaming industry is seeing the endless stream of DLC's as the new klondike... but thats the way the industry works nowadays. So no longer can you really judge a game before the first few big patches and a DLC.African Union going purity and wooping alien♥♥♥♥♥♥(story? if any?) seemed a bit weird. And if you play the game EXACTLY like you would a Warlord (ish) 6 man Civ5 map you will win easy.Hopefully they will give the story a little more depth. Get the NPC's to make more sense, invest in some CGI to make our victories feel really really rewarding and give this game a more unique feel. If you looking for a mindblowing new game or a really big step forward in the Civilization's genre. Wait for steamsale when they sell a pack including the first few DLC's for say... 20 bucks.

												First of all, I only started plaing CIV from 5 so take my opinion with a pinch of salt.I quite liked playing Beyond Earth, as it kind of changes up the formula from CIV 5. However, it does not change it up enough, in my opinion. Replacing barbarians with aliens and resources with different resources is not that creative. However the addition of affinities and the differing technology tree is really nice.So does it feel like a CIV game? Yes. Yes it does.Could it have been an addition or mod to - for example - CIV 5? Yes again.Over all, thought, I recommend playing Beyond Earth if you are like me and just want to pretend you just continued playing your game after achieving a science victory in an earlier entry and are now on a different planet continuing right where you left of.

There may not be special units for each sponser, but it makes up for with the previously mentioned Affinities.

You already have too much to focus on, what with making your civilization sucessful, and with the new unit system, it simplifies a lot of things for you, and makes it easy to understand exactly what the weapons you have at your disposal are capable of.Buy this game.

I love the virtue system which feels much more impactful on the game than ....forget the word but what you buy with culture in Civ 5.

Also the higher difficulty is just the opposing factions gaining boosts and costs deducted due to lack of sophisticated AI for higher level  play especially in combat.

												So, I played this during a free trial weekend.  I had a great time with it, but I do have to caveat this recommendation with - if you have CIV 5, you may want to wait for it to drop in price before purchasing this.  The games feel remarkably similar, and while there are certainly several differences between CIV 5 and CIV BE, CIV BE feels like a moded CIV 5.But if you've never played CIV and like turn based strategy on a grand scale, this one is worth picking up, I'd say. Or CIV 5.  Whichever really.			",72,17,0,15,9,0,8

												I'm not a connoisseur of this genre, but I do like the Space Empires franchise as well as Star Craft (which is RTS not TBS, but not too distantly related). Space Empires was my main frame of references for judging this game. The two games are quite similar. It's not as customizable as Space Empires, but you have enough options to give your faction your own personal touches. In fact, based on playing SE, I can tell you that it gets tedious designing every single ship and then having to redesign them when you level up, so any more customization could just bog the game down. For a strategy game, the run time isn't bad, depending on your settings. You can knock out a game in a few hours if you have a small world and not a lot of factions. I've found diplomacy works better in this game than other strategy games I've played, and things like a peace treaty tend to hold up. Going to war with a country won't forever ruin relations with them. The one thing I dislike about strategy games is the combat mechanics. It's very ridged. Everything comes down to the unit's stats, and unlike say a first person shooter, you can't win an engagement by skill alone, you can never have an underdog win. If you have a unit with lower stats than the attacking unit, you lose. But that’s true of most strategy games.

												I think I have played all civilization games and their derivatives since I fell in love with the original Microprose game. I have been a great fan of the franchise and the direction they have taken for their turn-based strategy philosophy through the years.I really wanted to like this game, and it was one of the releases I was anticipating. But it failed to deliver. It is not exactly a bad game. It is just more like an extensive mod of Civ5 than an original. Also, if you are playing in Linux/OS X, it is currently playable but very buggy.If you are thinking of buying this game but haven't played Civ5, by all means, buy that one instead. And if you really want a SciFi-themed civilization game you'd be better off re-playing the very dated but still good Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri, or trying the excellent Galactic Civilizations franchise (no relation to Sid's games, but that doesn't stop them from being great).

												Civilization: Beyond Earth holds up the civilization line quite sufficently, with beautiful, lush terrain and smooth gameplay. This game is exactly what i was looking for in a follow up for the  Civilization series. I would say that  the affinity's, quests and alien life are the highlights for me, and the only tweaks needed would be in in AI and preffered affinity's dominating the variety of games, because sometimes it seems like the whole world is going with supremacy, and leaving your purity/harmony civ kicked out of the club. but all in all, it is a great follow up for the series, and I personally can't wait for the DLC!!!

												I like this game. I like it a great deal It is not without its difficulties nad challenges, but as several people have said before, if you look at where Civ V is today (the game from which this one got its skeleton), its clear that Firaxis still knows how to put together an excellent and lovingly balanced game.I'm not entirely sure Civ: BE is there quite yet, but it is still quite fun. In addition, the things it does well are done beautifully.Tech Tree:The tech tree is rich, and it is wide. This means that you have to specialize to develop towards your victory strategy, and that you will be leaving things out as you do so. The way that they have the military units implemented do an excellent job of rewarding your choices rather than punishing your shortfalls. In addition, the ""Steal tech"" option is always valuable, as there is no way  that you have researched even all of the second ring of tech by the end of the game, so a little bit of free midrange tech is a nice little reward.Culture Tree:Again, they did an excellent job of rewarding your choices,  whether you choose to specialize or generalize. Every tree has rewards after so many virtues are unlocked, and every virtue tier has rewards for the same, regardless of which tree those virtues are in.Military:Units never obsolete, and the affinity paths that you choose (be they specialized or broad) allow you access to powerful benefits for the core units as well as affinity-specific units which further have some benefits for developing a secondary affinity. Fewer overall core units, but more choices than Civ.Overall, I think this is a very good start. If Civ: BE gets the same degree of attention that the Civ V series has over the past couple years, I think that the things that really make it shine today will be the very things that will make it an overall richer game than Civ V is today.

As a whole it is certantly a fun game, needing a bit of polish still and maybe even a bit of DLC but as it is I would certantly recomend this gameThis is Civ beyond earth, this is not alpha centauri 2, stop judging this game based on alpha centauri and judge it based on what it is, Beyond earth.

												I am grateful that this game had a free weekend, so as someone who doesn't normally play games like Civilization, I get a chance to play to the full game.

												Definitely a beautiful game with lots of different story directions.  However, I personally found the actual gameplay very repetitive and boring, somehow.  Honestly, the much cartoonier Civilization Revolutions was dramatically more fun, despite the more limited progression options. I truly enjoy this style of game, normally, and own many.  Few have this level of depth in narrative, but the gameplay doesn't pull you into the story the way it should.  Options with supposedly big consequences storywise end up being simple ""a or b"" choices based on the actual gameplay effects, which are minimal. I was wary of paying full price for this one due to the mixed reviews, and I now know why they were so negative. Worth picking up on sale only.			",70,70,0,22,22,0,18

												This, just like any Civ game so far, is interesting only until you have learned all the rules. Then it becomes repetitive. The biggest failure of the whole series is the battle system. It was corny in the beginning, it is corny now. I don't mind researching, diplomacy, building and so forth, but a game should have a bit more action than a short animation after which one or both opponents are damaged, or one of them is dead. I mean, now that it is possible to set up actual battles (since maybe 2005 or so), why haven't the Firaxis people spiced the games up a bit? At least a separate battle board where there would be some tactical possibilities? I'm not talking about huge effects but at least some added tactical interest to the battles since the game has military units in it.I would keep the campaign map neat and simple, and I would make it look big, map-like, instead of the way it is now: a toy landscape. Then I would set up a battle system - no matter what kind of system, but such that the player has more control over the outcome than just ""who has the biggest gun wins"" or some rock-paper-scissors type of thing. Believe me Firaxis - you would even play the game yourselves then.That said, this game is no worse than Civ 5 in any way, although not as large in scope. For the price I paid for it it's pretty OK for a couple of days' playing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've read some reviews where people didn't like this game but I feel they went into it thinking it would be another Alpha Centauri, and while it has things in common with that it also has things in common with Civ and is it's own entity.  I personally really enjoyed it, the tech web is nice and honestly you really have to make choices on what you want to research because yoU will not be able to research everything, nor is that required.  I love the virtue system which feels much more impactful on the game than ....forget the word but what you buy with culture in Civ 5.  Really this game feels more streamlined in some respects but that doesn't mean bad, the micromanagement doesn't feel as strong in Civ but it is still there and honestly, I seem to have the same problem with this game that i did with Civ and Alpha, I just can't stop....one....more.....turn.

												Their has been extensive bashing on this game but honestly its a good well developed game. Of course its not going to be like the Civ 5 with all DLCs. It has about 30% new things from Civ5 and I am content with that, it freshes it up without getting rid of the Civ 5 legacy or feel.In all honesty this should have been a stand alone from the Civilization series perhaps? I don't know but as a person who just enjoys good games this is it. Diplomacy Aspect: 5/10 - They didn't make any big changes from the Civ5 Diplomacy. Dissapointed.Military Aspect: 9/10 - They got new units and designs. Great.Trade Aspect: 7/10 - The same but a good aspect to have.Aliens Aspect: 9/10 - Different Species and different actions, great addon.Tech Aspect: 9.5/10 - Very good, I think its the best aspect of the game.Culture/Ideology Aspect: 9/10 - New things, new design and template.

												So while i'm not normally one for reviews i felt this is one I should write. After finnaly haveing 100 hours into this i can still say i enjoy playing. I realize many players have lost intrest and for the life of me I don't know why. Visually the game is very pleasing as well as the 3D rendered models of the Factions really adds an in-depth experiance for me. I found the units to be alright although i understand that in the DLC they will be upgraded which is needed. The diplomacy is a little lacking compared to 5 but then again so was vanilla 5. I found it to be odd that a faction far in supremcy would say that I as a high purity faction have lost that which makes me human. Now as far as cons go i do have quite a few, starting with the uncolured techweb which takes a while to memorize. Next is the fact that religon isn't here at all(One of my favorite aspects of 5). I feel like diplomacy could be more polished and each faction should have more unique dialouge. The last thing i would mention is the completly lack luster wonders, if you pick this up(which you should) I would recommend getting the awesome wonders mod. Overall i still find myself booting up this game quite abit. I would stress that the modding community for this game is amazing and that it certainly makes the game. I can safely say that most of my hours in the game were spent on mods and I would highly recommend the Unity project as well as the Awesome mods(all of them). So my final rating would be a 7/10. 9/10 if you play with all the wonderfull mods out there.			",14,10,0,18,8,0,15

The game itself seems to be flawed as they left out unique units with special abilities. Also the higher difficulty is just the opposing factions gaining boosts and costs deducted due to lack of sophisticated AI for higher level  play especially in combat.

												This game looks good, but then you play it and realize its still like a beta. There aren't even scenarios yet. The game is over priced and even discounted at 30 is still a waste. The game also only has 8 civs to choose from, but the community has already added some creative ones. The reason I like it is that is has great potential and I would like to see some great mods from the community and creative expansions from the developers.EDIT 8/25/15This game hasn't changed at all in a year. The new DLC looks like something that should have been included in the main game. Also it sounds like they don't even want you to use the new water cities by making AI agressive toward them and there are more sea monsters that can destroy them. The new units just seem like a pathetic attempt to add unit diversity to the game. I don't think this game is worth it and would love a refund.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You will hear a lot of complaints about this game; it's relatively shallow, the characters lack personality, it's essentially a clone of Civ V, the settings are ugly, etc., etc.. And those are not without justification; this is not as good of a game as Civilization V, which has had multiple expansion packs and a lot of love from its devs compared to Beyond Earth, seen as a bit of a red-headed step-child to the Civ franchise.That said, this game does feel quite a bit like Civ V, and that is not a bad thing at all. Consider this a review of Rising Tide, because without it I do not recommend the game, but with its additions (floating cities, the new diplomacy points system, the increased effectiveness of Spies) the game feels less like a clone with a new paint job and more of a very clever total conversion mod. If you find this game on sale with Rising Tide and have already logged your hundreds of hours in Civ V, go grab it! You will not be disappointed, assuming you've already heard all the (mostly undeserved) negative press. It's a fun, addictive, sci-fi Civ game that really will suck you in if you're willing to give it the chance.7/10.			",60,4,0,10,7,1,11

												Man, a lot of people hate this game. Personally, I find it just as fun as Civ V; the things that are good about it are somewhat different from the things that are good about Civ V.First of all, the tech web is strictly and massively superior to the traditional tech tree. In CBE, the tech web probably has over 100 technologies on it, but you'll only have time to research 20 or 30; the path you take through the tree will massively change what strategies/units/buildings you have available to you later on, which is awesome. I personally like that the effects of each technology aren't immediately obvious. In Civ V it gets tiresome to research the same sequences over and over, just in slightly different orders depending on your strategy. With CBE, you can get totally different results by going in different tech directions.I also like the affinity system. I like that each affinity gives you different buffs, which can pair in interesting ways with the attributes of the various sponsors. The new victory options are also fun, although the ""wait 20 turns"" mechanic is not ideal.The different planets are also nice. Exoplanets expansion is 100% worth it.Overall, if you come in expecting another Civ clone like the main-series games, you'll be disappointed. CBE is much more a variation on the theme, one which I think brings out some great, fresh ideas in a cool new location.			",37,38,0,2,6,0,6

												Basically a high production value re-skin of Civ 5.  Not awful but I regret pre-ordering it and I wouldn't bother buying it until it went on special.It has promise - but it's not realised.Single worst feature is the trade routes which is endless busy work that drags out an already dull end game.The other thing that needs an overhaul is the quest system.  The first time through it seems cool.  Then you realise you get exactly the same options every time and its just more busy work.  At higher levels you will make the same choices almost everytime anyway.Might be saved if it recieves the level of DLC that Civ 4 and 5 got - but given they will charge another decent whack on top of the original purchase price it might be years before I bother coming back to this game.If you want a good 4X game give Endless Legend a go.  Not the be all and end all but a lot more interesting than this and far more deserving of your support			",41,6,0,14,5,0,29

												Unlike all the other people comparing this game to civ 5 or alpha centauri I will not do so. I will judge this game as it is. Jumping into it I will openly admit I got really confused at first. The UI isn't the best in the world but it only takes some adapting, same with any game you just leap into. As a whole it is certantly a fun game, needing a bit of polish still and maybe even a bit of DLC but as it is I would certantly recomend this gameThis is Civ beyond earth, this is not alpha centauri 2, stop judging this game based on alpha centauri and judge it based on what it is, Beyond earth.

												It was a nice idea but I feel like they strayed too far away from what made Civ 1-5 good. The faction system was a cool idea but having it implemented via the tech tree, in my opinon, was a poor decision. Not a fan of the new unit upgrading system either as there's a huge imbalance once you get ahead by a single upgrade. I feel like they tried to fix what wasn't broken in Civ 5 and the result was Beyond Earth.4/10Not worth buying, I'd recommend just playing Civ 5 with mods if you want a space themed Civ game.

												First game finished, using my normal Civ Settings, map as big as possible and everything as slow as possible, but with a mid range difficulty so I could learn my ropes (mercury, what kind of name for a difficulty is that?). Slightly over 1600 turns before victory, should have upped the difficulty (I should have known that) as it was not really hard anytime.It is a very nice hack of Civ V, I like the differences that are and not disliking anything special. The units are really cool and there are nice presentations and even a cut scene or two.It is not an experience as it was to play Alpha Centauri, but perhaps  thats me and not the game, a bit dull sometimes and really just a Civ V version, but a nice one.I was good enough for me to buy the expansion and then starting a new game ASAP, so that must mean something.

												This new game seems  much harder than the previous Civ 5 game. I manged to get an ""Emancipation Victory"" on Vostok difficulty, but it wasn't easy and took me several attempts. I can put my victory down to having a starting area which was within reach of all major strategic resources, continual use of new orbital feature, constant covert operations to steal energy. jumping around research tree to maximize affinity and build options.Overall I can say I had an enoyable time playing and the new features are good enough to justify buying the game.The one critisicm I have is that when you get a ""Victory"" you get a very poor ending , a simple splash page and a small paragraph. The game needs a short animation for each victory type.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The human species breaking free of its cradle and colonizing other planets has been my ultimate dream for most of my life and still is. I consider 4X to be my favourite genre for no less than 5 years now. Among strategy franchises, Sid Meier's... anything has long reigned supreme in my mind. The convergence of these things so dearly important to me, has caused me to approach this title with significant trepidation of a joyous variety. This review concerns the base game with the Exoplanets DLC, but without the Rising Tide expansion.Let's get the things that are easier to gauge out of the way first. The visuals and sounds are acceptable, but not much more than that. The graphics of the ground have this weird blurriness about them that I find difficult to describe, but it's certainly hard on the eyes. Despite being pretty, they're not very legible in general, making it troublesome to make out some special features of individual tiles, such as Resource Pods or Alien Nests. The rest of the interface is okay, although I couldn't easily find a list of hotkeys anywhere ingame and had to Google it. There is no ""strategic view"" (2D hex map), which is an absolute blunder - it was super useful in Civ5. The adequate-but-uninspired trend extends to music. The war music certainly has its moments, but the rest of it is pretty meh. On the technical side of things, I was not able to launch the game using AMD Mantle, despite having a 290X and up-to-date drivers. It's a minor disappointment that I'm willing to chalk up to Matle being retired anyway AFAIK. The most common bug ingame is one where the combat animation gets stuck and two units go at it for 15-20 seconds before some sort of infinite-loop failsafe kicks in. And this happens a lot. Embarassing. Alright! Now let me sell you a bridge talk about the design. Judging by the Steam score, it seems like the reception of this game wasn't very good. I have not read any other review of it at all, but I imagine the main issue other diehard fans are having is missing features. Yes, they are missing. I love it! It feels like I've won the lottery because all the things that are missing... well, I'm not missing them. Allow me to explain why less is more, and why I like this title so much. diplomatic victory - oh... my least favourite victory, even less desirable than cultural. Yeah, I'm totally feeling this loss. NOT. council / voting on global laws / advanced diplomacy - yeah, this is something that I would've preferred having. But after ""reading into"" the lore of Beyond Earth (""BE"") deeply enough (maybe too deeply...), I suddenly came up with an explanation. In the original Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri (""AC""), Earth succumbs to the cancer that is humanity - and takes us with it - while the colony ships are still in transit, just like in the movie Pandorum. So it is understandable then, that the colony leaders feel free in making grand political decisions, because they have no populations or governments left back home that might judge them - morally or legally. Not so here. The Lasercom Satellite and the Promised Land victory tell us that humanity continues to survive on Earth, not just Beyond it. More importantly, they show us that the leaders are likely to feel loyal towards them. And thus, while still open to the more pressing and tactical considerations of war, peace and trade, they are nevertheless unwilling to make huge decisions that might impact the identity of their colonies out of reverence and respect for their sponsors on Earth. terraforming - a cherished staple of AC, alongside Planet Busters. This is personal preference, but I don't like having it in my 4X. When available, it sends me into an obsessive-compulsive mental tailspin that's more harm than good. Like... have you ever had that kind of Civ2 game where you put a farm on every tile that could be irrigated? If I can lower hills or drain coasts, I'm going to end up with a planet flat as a crepe and covered in farmland. And I don't know why, but it feels disgusting. I much prefer working within the confines, the original shape of the terrain rather than modifying it. Most of the time I roleplay not using these features, but I like it even more if they're not there. unit design - this is usually present in games that take place on a interstellar scale. Creating units out of components. I abhor this with an intensity much greater than terraforming, though for slightly different reasons. Which I will not list out of concern for the length of this ""review"". Suffice to say, when I earlier mentioned the changes feel like winning the lottery, I mostly meant unit design being gone. Hip hip hurray! not many units to choose from - there is one melee soldier, one ranged soldier, one plane, one ship etc. And like... two specialized units per affinity? And that's it. You upgrade these, but even then it might feel like there is no variety. I like it. It reflects the way I tend to play, where I pick 2 or 3 units and spam them. It also makes sense from an ingame point of view that a handful of ""core concepts"" for various combat roles are refined and built upon over time rather than constantly having to build the newest unit and disband the old ones.To keep things regretfully balanced, the game also has flaws. Chief among them is the relative weakness of the lore. Yang's quip about God playing dice and the dice being loaded is somehow a contender for my most memorable gaming quote of all time. AC was chock full of stellar writing that made up for how little of it there was with how smart it was. The voice acting was also surprisingly decent. All of this contributed to an unmatched atmosphere, one of the best in the genre... BE feels plastic and hollow by comparison. Cheap. Utterly uninspired. BE has voice actors for each of the colony leaders... why then, does some generic and unpleasant voice read out the flavour text for new technologies and wonders? And why is that text so bland? And why are there no videos for the wonders? It feels like all of AC's atmosphere has vented out into space. BE's writing is passable, from a strictly sci-fi point of view, but I expected more, so much more... Oh, and the whole Planet has the potential to be sentient and is waking up RITE NAO angle has been marginalised to a woeful degree. I miss those black screens with nothing but text appearing out of nowhere - their spartan form would somehow drive home the impression that really heavy stuff is going on.Similarly, the colony leaders and sponsor-states are amalgamations of contemporary, politically correct tripe. The shape of BE's sponsors represents awkwardly wishful thinking; not even the Great Mistake would've been enough to form some of those entities in reality. So here we are, with these arbitrary clumps of nations as factions, whereas AC's factions represented concepts, particular ideals and ways of viewing life - a more correct notion for a far-future society on an entirely different planet, free of Earth's geography. AC's factions had actual flavour, the leaders felt vibrant. BE's leaders are little more than memes. I don't have much to say about the gameplay because - honestly - I think we're both equally tired of this review by now. It's Civ5 in space and it feels great, because Civ5 felt great. I regret not having fortification tile improvents, or airports, or nukes (of the ordinary variety), or the economic victory from AC, but these are things I can live without. I'm not sure why I put so much effort or so many words into this thing, as I had no illusions of changing anyone's mind from the start. If you wanted AC dressed up in modern graphics while retaining all of its original features, you're out of luck. If you wanted Civ5 reskinned into a sci-fi setting, you're in luck. I didn't even know I wanted that, but now I sure do.			",373,161,13,64,42,6,90

												first, I should confess that I continue to play the original Alpha Centauri and its sequel, Alpha Centauri:Alien Crossfire.  Awesome game, with modifiable terrain, wonderful video clips played whenever you built a Wonder, and the aliens scaled up to be ever more menacing as the game progressed.so, as you can imagine, my expectations of Sid Meier's Beyond Earth were high! Brian Reynolds and Sid had set the bar with Alpha Centauri, and after so many years, with so much better hardware to harness, I expected them to rock my world with Beyond Earth. mistake. (mine).  that kind of expectation was clearly unrealistic!is Beyond Earth a poor game? No! its fine - and much much better than Civ5 in the way you experience the story.However, it is a retrograde development compared to Alpha Centauri, which is deeply disappointing for me - I doubt I will still be playing Beyond Earth in 15 years time!  Other reviewers have expressed the view that additional DLC might improve the state of affairs, but the lack of terraformable land, the lack of a real challenge from the native fauna/flora, the loss of the brilliant faction system defined by philosophy rather than nationalism: a missed opportunity.do I regret buying it? No - I am going to go back and play some more after finishing this review! Is it what it could or should have been ? not even close.SMAC (sid meier's alpha centauri) is still available on gog.com for a song, and is in so many ways the better game.so....what do i suggest? buy both and decide for yourself!;^>			",70,27,0,37,9,0,16

												2016 RE-reviewLike most folks, i was not very thrilled by CIV BE when it came out back in 2014. The initial release was a little bare bones to say the least. Seemingly weird and different 'just' to be different. Yet, with an engine and interface virtually identical to Civ5. It felt like a full price mod or worse a re-skin of Civ5. To be fair, that alone would have in my eyes justified a purchase. But it was not what we expected. Or wanted to pay for. Now, those of us that remember SMAC, are definately remembering it through thoroughly rose tinted glasses. It was seminal, ground breaking, freaking awesome BACK in the day. Now, its still good, just not that good. Beyond Earth is not SMAC 2. And I would argue it doesn't have to be. Its a different game, set in (more or less) the same ""place.""Fast forward to Rising Tide, a bunch of patches and sale prices later. 2016. Should you buy it? Yes, no question. the only caveats I would offer to those of you who are very picky eaters. I have replayed it start to finish and have just started another game immediately. i love it! I think you may also. But keep the following in mind:It has a science fiction feel that you need to embrace on a role playing level. Watched Interstellar? Want to find out whats happens after the ending? THIS is your game!  Read the individual writeups and if you have time, read up online how many are based on actual science/scifi concepts. The various buildings and abilities make the game so much more dynamic, than the Civ5 map-based resource structure. Building an empire on a desolate wasteland is an interesting challenge.The 'Barbarian' life forms keep the AI in check, especially on large maps, so you get few vast AI empires.  Interesting things happen, even without the added events. The quests are a very nice touch and now have structure/reward, beyond the simple +1 whatever resource of the vanilla game.  Game winning victory devices are built in vulnurable hexes outside your cities, foreshadowing Civ6 city districts. The tech tree is a weird mess, but after a few play throughs you will understand its structure and know how to pick your own path. And over-lapping Affinities really spice up units and abilities.yes, some parts of the game are STILL a little rough around the edges, but I think that is mainly due to the lack of customer support for the game. Why should Firaxis keep working on a game that was so negatively received?Buy it for a very enjoyable take on what happens after a Civ science victory. Just don't expect it to be earth shattering.2014 Review:No idea where all the hate is coming from. Its more Civ. Whats not to like??It uses the Civ5 interface, so yes, it will seem familiar. What do people want? change just for the sake of change?The game will probably get more intricate once they release dlc. But its completely playable and entertaining.			",301,83,2,41,16,2,49

												You will hear a lot of complaints about this game; it's relatively shallow, the characters lack personality, it's essentially a clone of Civ V, the settings are ugly, etc., etc.. And those are not without justification; this is not as good of a game as Civilization V, which has had multiple expansion packs and a lot of love from its devs compared to Beyond Earth, seen as a bit of a red-headed step-child to the Civ franchise.That said, this game does feel quite a bit like Civ V, and that is not a bad thing at all. Consider this a review of Rising Tide, because without it I do not recommend the game, but with its additions (floating cities, the new diplomacy points system, the increased effectiveness of Spies) the game feels less like a clone with a new paint job and more of a very clever total conversion mod. If you find this game on sale with Rising Tide and have already logged your hundreds of hours in Civ V, go grab it! You will not be disappointed, assuming you've already heard all the (mostly undeserved) negative press. It's a fun, addictive, sci-fi Civ game that really will suck you in if you're willing to give it the chance.7/10.			",60,4,0,10,7,1,11

												This game is a step backwards in every way from Civ V. The mechanics seem specifically designed to DISCOURAGE interaction between players, and fighting a war is almost never a good idea.If you want a good 4X game, get Civ V and its expansions. This might be good someday, but it's not right now.EDIT: A few years later and the game was essentially abandoned. It had a lot of potential but unless you plan on modding the hell out of it, all of that potential was wasted and I honestly feel ripped off.			",173,25,1,36,23,2,55

												I haven't played Civilization V or IV for that matter, so I'm not going to recommend or not Beyond Earth based on how it compares to these games. Last Civilization games I played were Alpha Centauri and a little bit of Civilization III. I played Civilization II for countless hours when I was younger. Beyond Earth is basically to Civilization V what Alpha Centauri was to Civilization II and it shows. It shows in the land features such as ""Miasma"" (blue) instead of ""Xenofungus"" (pink).The Good:There are no more governors to deal within the cities you build. That might seem like something that would increase micro-management, but it isn't. The way this was automated is simpler, you don't have an incompetent governor deciding to build scrap anymore. You simply set the focus of the city and fill its build queue to your desire. These 2 activities are not without their frustrations, but I find that I do a lot less micro-management with the simplest way of addressing a problem.The difficulty levels seem to have been tuned down a bit. When I use to barely be able to play at Warlord in Civ III with normal game parameters, Beyond Earth offers a kinder difficulty curve and I was able to beat it at its worst.The upgrade system for units has been greatly simplified compared to Alpha Centauri and that's a time sink which is appreciatively gone. The upgrade system features 3 affinity branches with 3 levels of upgrades per units and 2 choices per level to make. What's better than before is you don't have to spend coutnless hours upgrading and designing new units. The upgrades are applied instantly. Same Old Civ:The AI is still completely wacko. One turn it might decide that you're great enough for an alliance and the next it just declares war for no apparent reasons. That's the usual Civilization knowledge base. The AI just evaluates its decisions based on very slim criteria which may or may not make sense. For instance, if you play on a tiny map versus a single AI opponent, it may effectively ask you to never buy any land because it is too close to its territory.Diplomacy is still lacking. The AI can insult you, but you can't insult anyone. Overall diplomacy in Civilization has always felt like 2 robots talking to each other and Beyond Earth is no different. I find the constant harassment of AI players asking for resources in return of favors to be ultimately worthless as far game experience goes.  The Bad:Setting the focus of a city and build queue would be great if the UI wasn't complete trash. There's just too much clicking to go around this interface. For example, to setup the build queue, first you need to activate it with a check box, then you need to click on add queue, then you fill it. If you want to convert production, you have to uncheck the activate check box, then click on choose production. If you want to remove a convert production, you have to make sure the activate check box isn't on. It's very tedious.The diplomacy UI is also just as horrible as the city management screen. Options show up the list which you just can't pick because of some precondition not meant. Too many times I just tried to pick those just to find out they're actually disabled.To conclude, Beyond Earth is 6-7/10 depending on how much of a fan of the series you are. Most of the flack I would throw at it comes from the UI and the user experience. There's also a few bugs here and there on SteamOS. Still, I find no problems in recommending this game. Even with its problems, it's still fun to play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First time in my life it happened. I started playing this game during the day and when I next looked at the watch, it was over 8 hours passed. I didn't eat, I didn't sleep. This game is a life ruiner. I am still playing it. At least it helps with the weight loss :) 10/10Play and you will not regret.			",18,0,0,8,3,0,6

												Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth, is a continuation of the time period beyond normal Civilization Continuity. Taking place after a great disaster has occurred upon Earth mankind has moved into the stars to ensure its survival. The game begins with you selecting a sponsor and various long term and onetime bonus allowing you to craft your own play style from turn one. However, the selecting a sponsor is also points out what is one of Civ: Beyond Earth greatest weakness, variety.Upon landing  upon a world which art style and feel are most certainly harken back to Alpha Centria, with the old harsh red tones of old scraped away.  The game plays very much like a civilization game, resources strategic or otherwise play out to help your young colony grow into a prosperous future nation. Over time other sponsors send your future allies or enemies to seed their own future nation.As turns, research, random events, and quest continue on throughout the game, your actions and choices will help determine the natural course of your societies growth.  If you inclination is to exterminate the natural species on the planet you will move more toward purity, if you take actions more against your fellow man you will acquire supremacy easier, and if you want to live with the native species and co-exist, you will morph into harmony. As your become more inclined to a path your cities and units will change to reflect your play style.Civilization game Civ: Beyond Earth is a good game, but it lacks several things which make it a great game, and to be fair it is important to point those things out. If you are looking for a large amount of variation in gameplay, in its current state Beyond Earth Cannot deliver, the starting factions are too few, which makes replay factor with other factions very limited. The greatest problem, however, is in the affinity system. While is it a wonderful system for what it does, at the end of the game it also creates a game where you have three main styles of play to go down. While there are many gameplay methods to change up the way you play, it would have been enjoyable to see other affinities to help support those styles. Long term I am hoping more affinities are such as one to support stronger economic/diplomacy models.Over all Civ: Beyond Earth is game which I would give a positive review for, it will hopefully follow the Civilization V model and continue to grow over time into a stronger game. The game in and of itself has a great deal to offer.  As a long time Civilization player, personally I feel a few key things were missing which make this game a truly phenomenal game, but I would still suggest you purchase it if you love the series.

												I was highly anticipating this game, preordered it and installed it ASAP. I played a couple games and realized that I just don't like this game. I don't like that each ""faction"" is so similar in play style, I don't like the ""pick-a-perk"" style of forming your faction, I figured out that I don't care for the futurism, and I don't like the tech web. I guess the fact that I have so much play time in Civ 5 makes me biased a bit, but everything is better in Civ 5. (This is just a re-skin of Civ 5 anyway, so comparing it is Apples to Apples). There are many, many civs to choose from in Civ 5, each having their own uniqueness with differing units, buildings, traits, tile improvements...I think that is my primary gripe with CIV BE, the ""factions"" are not unique enough from one another to have any meanigful contrast. I like the agressiveness and how the aliens work in this game, I even like the terrain art, I also like the orbital layer and orbital defense units. Maybe if they had a ""globe view"", spacecraft battles, and multi-planet management (controlling colonies on more than one planet and maneuvering between those planets with spacecraft) I could get into this game.

												Having never played Civ V, I can't comment on the improvements this game does or doen't make. But coming from Civ IV, Beyond Earth feels like a downgrade. The other civilizations in this game lack personality so playing becomes a lonely experience. Nothing really seems to take advantage of the future setting, the alien life is mostly dressing and miasma is just there to keep your from building at a normal speed.I wanted to love this game, but in the end, I uninstalled it and went back to IV. It's with a sad and heavy heart that I don't recommend this game.			",50,12,0,10,5,0,11

												With the addition of Rising Tides, I decided that a full update to this review is in order.With the addition of Rising Tide and several major patches released in the months following it, Civilization Beyond Earth - Rising Tides (BE-RT) is finally deserving of a full, unconditional endorsement. As it stands now, this is unquestionably a superior game to previous Civ's, and more importantly, it is a *different* game. Comparing to Civ V: While the initial critique of ""Civ V with a sci-fi skin"" may have been a justified comment (although a tad harsh) in the early days, it is now completely unjustified. The basic mechanics are essentially the same (map, movement, resources, cities), but that's about it. Everything else is different, and there are some major changes in those differences. With Rising Tides and subsequent patches, BERT is worthy of being called a completely new game, and a completely superior game to the old Civ V. Still lacks some of the things that made Alpha Centauri so awesome, but it has its own strengths, so I won't knock it too badly for that.My first big warning for new players is regarding unit diversity. If you are used to Civ V where you had hundreds of different units, it will seem like a shock. Instead you'll see a hundred different variations of about a dozen units. And these variations aren't nailed down by faction, either. As you progress through the tech tree, you'll be offered choices as to how to upgrade your units. For the generic set, you will probably have 4-5 upgrade choices over the course of the game, and which options you get to choose from differ depending on your tech choices. Effectively, there's probably at least a hundred different versions of each of the basic units, although probably only about 20 or so that are massivelydifferent. Beyond the basic units, there is a whole slew of specialty units of various kinds, each with their own 3-5 upgrade steps, but as they have specific tech and affinity requirements to unlock, it is quite likely that you won't see even a quarter of the unit types in any one game. Long story short, you may be building the most basic ""soldier"" unit right up until the end of the game, but whereas it is a basic militia sort at the beginning, by the end of the game it's a futuristic combat squad with a host of abilities.Espionage: Forget the old Civ V style spy game, spies are back, they are different, and they are worth paying attention to. Like a lot of things, the basic spy game is similar to Civ V: You put spies in your cities to defend them, or in enemy cities to spy on them. End of similarities. First off, you pick what you want your spies to do. Initially, they can't do much, but as they build up their contacts in the city, they gain access to bigger and better things. You can also keep spies back at HQ to provide some civilization-wide bonuses for you, or send them to the black market to buy or sell strategic resources. Lots of options to fit a wide variety of different strategies.Pro:- The tech web is awesome. So much more variety and options to diversify gameplay.- Espionage is much improved. Actually interesting now.- The Seeding (Starting setup) is much more varied, and a lot more interesting.- More interesting unit abilities- Oceans are very interesting now.- Every faction has a solid chance at winning every victory type.Con:- Affinity is everything. If you're going for any victory type other than Contact or time, techs that give affinity progress trump all other considerations. Trumps EVERYTHING. - Less variety in unit types, hard to tell the difference between different versions of the same unit. And a lot of the units are affinity specific, meaning you need high levels of a particular affinity to get them. So they tend to be rather rare.- The stupid black copyright box that pops up at the start of the game is really annoying. (same as Civ V's)- You can't peg factions anymore. Each civ only has a single bonus that is constant, all the rest of the civ-wide bonuses and traits vary from game to game. My recommendation? Buy this game! If you like Civ games, and you like sci-fi and the thought of colonizing another world, you will almost certainly enjoy this game. My caveat, however, is to get Rising Tides with it. BE without RT is good, but not awesome. With RT, it is an excellent game. (This whole review is written based on BE with RT. See review below for my old review of it before the expansion). This game isn't Alpha Centauri, and will likely  never replace it, but it is the next best thing, and has its own strengths.Old review (written well before Rising Tides had ever been mentioned, so applies to Vanilla game only) beyond this point:Overall, a good game. It is a very nice change to go forward into the future instead of trying to rewrite the past. After a first play through it seemed kind of weak and lacking in variety, but there's actually got a reasonable amount of variation in there, especially in starting conditions. If you liked Civ V, chances are you'll like Civ BE, but be forwarned, there's going to be some culture shock, as you won't be faced with hundreds of different units. Instead you'll be dealing with hundreds of different varieties of about a dozen units.  If you play this game, give it three or four play throughs. And remember, it is highly likely there is going to be DLC for this. I expect it will get the Civ V treatment. If they respond to community concerns, there's a solid chance this will end up being an excellent game. Not as good as Alpha Centauri, but still a great game.These pros/cons are comparing to Civ V.Pro:- The tech web is awesome. So much more variety and options to diversify gameplay.- Espionage is much improved. Actually interesting now.- The Seeding (Starting setup) is much more varied, and a lot more interesting.Con:- Affinity is everything. If you're going for any victory type other than Contact or time, techs that give affinity progress trump all other considerations. Trumps EVERYTHING. - Less variety in unit types, hard to tell the difference between different versions of the same unit. And a lot of the units are affinity specific, meaning you need high levels of a particular affinity to get them. So they tend to be rather rare.- The stupid black copyright box that pops up at the start of the game is really annoying. (same as Civ V's)Recommendation: If you like Civ V or Alpha Centauri, get this game. I'd recommend waiting for a sale or a combo pack when they come out with DLC, though.Update: With the March 2015 patch they've fixed a lot of the bugs that plagued some of the users, as well as dealing with a bunch of player complaints. The update has deffinitely bumped up the quality of the game a few notches. It also totally rebalanced the Secret Projects. I mean wonders. : ) So if you built a highly effective strategy using them before, you're going to have to relearn them. All in all, the game feels like the emphasis has been shifted out slightly towards a slightly longer game. As in the really good wonders are a bit farther out on the tech web.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Civ Beyond is clearly intended to be familiar to fans, but it manages to overshoot that goal. At first it feels completely alien, but soon you've turned off that annoying tutorial guy and your giant death robots are hip-deep in ""barbarian"" guts making the day safe for waves of caravans. Actually, other than the utter lack of personality or uniqueness among factions during setup, you might be forgiven for thinking you were playing Endless Legend two hours before Civilization begins to creep in. By that time you've found some better weapons for your spacemen than slingshots, culture almost stops being useless, and spies are raking in the dough. Well, one thing I'll never get used to are those jerk ""city state"" ships dropping from the sky to land exactly where I was about to plop a colony.All in all, I like it. Looks Great. Runs faster on my laptop than Civ5 does. Then again, I'm only writing this instead of playing because it crashed. Affinities and tech web are awkward, satellites are awesome. A village was never ruined by trade. Play the game.TLDR; I was expecting AlphaCentauri, but i'll settle for this Civ5 mod of Endless Legend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While from what I played during the free weekend it is rather enjoyable, it is not at all worth the price of a full game - it is essentially an expansion for Civ 5 with some texture changes. Going to wait until the price drops (heavily...) before purchasing. Definately not the Second Coming of SMAC but I never expected it to be such.			",77,9,2,32,13,0,39

												With the addition of Rising Tides, I decided that a full update to this review is in order.With the addition of Rising Tide and several major patches released in the months following it, Civilization Beyond Earth - Rising Tides (BE-RT) is finally deserving of a full, unconditional endorsement. As it stands now, this is unquestionably a superior game to previous Civ's, and more importantly, it is a *different* game. Comparing to Civ V: While the initial critique of ""Civ V with a sci-fi skin"" may have been a justified comment (although a tad harsh) in the early days, it is now completely unjustified. The basic mechanics are essentially the same (map, movement, resources, cities), but that's about it. Everything else is different, and there are some major changes in those differences. With Rising Tides and subsequent patches, BERT is worthy of being called a completely new game, and a completely superior game to the old Civ V. Still lacks some of the things that made Alpha Centauri so awesome, but it has its own strengths, so I won't knock it too badly for that.My first big warning for new players is regarding unit diversity. If you are used to Civ V where you had hundreds of different units, it will seem like a shock. Instead you'll see a hundred different variations of about a dozen units. And these variations aren't nailed down by faction, either. As you progress through the tech tree, you'll be offered choices as to how to upgrade your units. For the generic set, you will probably have 4-5 upgrade choices over the course of the game, and which options you get to choose from differ depending on your tech choices. Effectively, there's probably at least a hundred different versions of each of the basic units, although probably only about 20 or so that are massivelydifferent. Beyond the basic units, there is a whole slew of specialty units of various kinds, each with their own 3-5 upgrade steps, but as they have specific tech and affinity requirements to unlock, it is quite likely that you won't see even a quarter of the unit types in any one game. Long story short, you may be building the most basic ""soldier"" unit right up until the end of the game, but whereas it is a basic militia sort at the beginning, by the end of the game it's a futuristic combat squad with a host of abilities.Espionage: Forget the old Civ V style spy game, spies are back, they are different, and they are worth paying attention to. Like a lot of things, the basic spy game is similar to Civ V: You put spies in your cities to defend them, or in enemy cities to spy on them. End of similarities. First off, you pick what you want your spies to do. Initially, they can't do much, but as they build up their contacts in the city, they gain access to bigger and better things. You can also keep spies back at HQ to provide some civilization-wide bonuses for you, or send them to the black market to buy or sell strategic resources. Lots of options to fit a wide variety of different strategies.Pro:- The tech web is awesome. So much more variety and options to diversify gameplay.- Espionage is much improved. Actually interesting now.- The Seeding (Starting setup) is much more varied, and a lot more interesting.- More interesting unit abilities- Oceans are very interesting now.- Every faction has a solid chance at winning every victory type.Con:- Affinity is everything. If you're going for any victory type other than Contact or time, techs that give affinity progress trump all other considerations. Trumps EVERYTHING. - Less variety in unit types, hard to tell the difference between different versions of the same unit. And a lot of the units are affinity specific, meaning you need high levels of a particular affinity to get them. So they tend to be rather rare.- The stupid black copyright box that pops up at the start of the game is really annoying. (same as Civ V's)- You can't peg factions anymore. Each civ only has a single bonus that is constant, all the rest of the civ-wide bonuses and traits vary from game to game. My recommendation? Buy this game! If you like Civ games, and you like sci-fi and the thought of colonizing another world, you will almost certainly enjoy this game. My caveat, however, is to get Rising Tides with it. BE without RT is good, but not awesome. With RT, it is an excellent game. (This whole review is written based on BE with RT. See review below for my old review of it before the expansion). This game isn't Alpha Centauri, and will likely  never replace it, but it is the next best thing, and has its own strengths.Old review (written well before Rising Tides had ever been mentioned, so applies to Vanilla game only) beyond this point:Overall, a good game. It is a very nice change to go forward into the future instead of trying to rewrite the past. After a first play through it seemed kind of weak and lacking in variety, but there's actually got a reasonable amount of variation in there, especially in starting conditions. If you liked Civ V, chances are you'll like Civ BE, but be forwarned, there's going to be some culture shock, as you won't be faced with hundreds of different units. Instead you'll be dealing with hundreds of different varieties of about a dozen units.  If you play this game, give it three or four play throughs. And remember, it is highly likely there is going to be DLC for this. I expect it will get the Civ V treatment. If they respond to community concerns, there's a solid chance this will end up being an excellent game. Not as good as Alpha Centauri, but still a great game.These pros/cons are comparing to Civ V.Pro:- The tech web is awesome. So much more variety and options to diversify gameplay.- Espionage is much improved. Actually interesting now.- The Seeding (Starting setup) is much more varied, and a lot more interesting.Con:- Affinity is everything. If you're going for any victory type other than Contact or time, techs that give affinity progress trump all other considerations. Trumps EVERYTHING. - Less variety in unit types, hard to tell the difference between different versions of the same unit. And a lot of the units are affinity specific, meaning you need high levels of a particular affinity to get them. So they tend to be rather rare.- The stupid black copyright box that pops up at the start of the game is really annoying. (same as Civ V's)Recommendation: If you like Civ V or Alpha Centauri, get this game. I'd recommend waiting for a sale or a combo pack when they come out with DLC, though.Update: With the March 2015 patch they've fixed a lot of the bugs that plagued some of the users, as well as dealing with a bunch of player complaints. The update has deffinitely bumped up the quality of the game a few notches. It also totally rebalanced the Secret Projects. I mean wonders. : ) So if you built a highly effective strategy using them before, you're going to have to relearn them. All in all, the game feels like the emphasis has been shifted out slightly towards a slightly longer game. As in the really good wonders are a bit farther out on the tech web.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is not civ 6. Beyond earth is to Civ 5 what Civilization: Colonization was to Civ 4. It uses the Civ 5 engine and borrows ALL the core game mechanics from Civ 5. It's packed full of new and interesting content like affinities and the tech web. The aliens are really when make this game great though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game amazing artistic tallent. Glad the art's crew for the game got to show some creativity for this game vs Civ V where they had to follow history and make sure it is all accurately baised. the game is very smooth and has an amazing tech web system unlike the tech tree where you follow through the age's from Civ V. This game still has the diffent ending's that you can experence through affinitie's. all in all and amazing game well done			",42,1,0,6,7,0,6

												Note I do not have the Rising Tide DLC. Can't really say what that is like.My first review of this game was negative, the UI was trash, AI irratic, and the game itself unintutive, buggy, and simply not fun it wasn't a civ game. Now I picked it up again almost a year and a half after it was originally released and noticed Firaxis fixed most of the issues I had with the game. The UI was cleaned up immensly, the AI is far superior to any other Civ game, and so many of the games concepts and the gameplay has been cleaned up and has been made much better.10/10 for fixing your♥♥♥♥♥♥ gg Firaxis gg.

												Having never played Civ V, I can't comment on the improvements this game does or doen't make. But coming from Civ IV, Beyond Earth feels like a downgrade. The other civilizations in this game lack personality so playing becomes a lonely experience. Nothing really seems to take advantage of the future setting, the alien life is mostly dressing and miasma is just there to keep your from building at a normal speed.I wanted to love this game, but in the end, I uninstalled it and went back to IV. It's with a sad and heavy heart that I don't recommend this game.			",50,12,0,10,5,0,11

												I was highly anticipating this game, preordered it and installed it ASAP. I played a couple games and realized that I just don't like this game. I don't like that each ""faction"" is so similar in play style, I don't like the ""pick-a-perk"" style of forming your faction, I figured out that I don't care for the futurism, and I don't like the tech web. I guess the fact that I have so much play time in Civ 5 makes me biased a bit, but everything is better in Civ 5. (This is just a re-skin of Civ 5 anyway, so comparing it is Apples to Apples). There are many, many civs to choose from in Civ 5, each having their own uniqueness with differing units, buildings, traits, tile improvements...I think that is my primary gripe with CIV BE, the ""factions"" are not unique enough from one another to have any meanigful contrast. I like the agressiveness and how the aliens work in this game, I even like the terrain art, I also like the orbital layer and orbital defense units. Maybe if they had a ""globe view"", spacecraft battles, and multi-planet management (controlling colonies on more than one planet and maneuvering between those planets with spacecraft) I could get into this game.

												Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth, is a continuation of the time period beyond normal Civilization Continuity. Taking place after a great disaster has occurred upon Earth mankind has moved into the stars to ensure its survival. The game begins with you selecting a sponsor and various long term and onetime bonus allowing you to craft your own play style from turn one. However, the selecting a sponsor is also points out what is one of Civ: Beyond Earth greatest weakness, variety.Upon landing  upon a world which art style and feel are most certainly harken back to Alpha Centria, with the old harsh red tones of old scraped away.  The game plays very much like a civilization game, resources strategic or otherwise play out to help your young colony grow into a prosperous future nation. Over time other sponsors send your future allies or enemies to seed their own future nation.As turns, research, random events, and quest continue on throughout the game, your actions and choices will help determine the natural course of your societies growth.  If you inclination is to exterminate the natural species on the planet you will move more toward purity, if you take actions more against your fellow man you will acquire supremacy easier, and if you want to live with the native species and co-exist, you will morph into harmony. As your become more inclined to a path your cities and units will change to reflect your play style.Civilization game Civ: Beyond Earth is a good game, but it lacks several things which make it a great game, and to be fair it is important to point those things out. If you are looking for a large amount of variation in gameplay, in its current state Beyond Earth Cannot deliver, the starting factions are too few, which makes replay factor with other factions very limited. The greatest problem, however, is in the affinity system. While is it a wonderful system for what it does, at the end of the game it also creates a game where you have three main styles of play to go down. While there are many gameplay methods to change up the way you play, it would have been enjoyable to see other affinities to help support those styles. Long term I am hoping more affinities are such as one to support stronger economic/diplomacy models.Over all Civ: Beyond Earth is game which I would give a positive review for, it will hopefully follow the Civilization V model and continue to grow over time into a stronger game. The game in and of itself has a great deal to offer.  As a long time Civilization player, personally I feel a few key things were missing which make this game a truly phenomenal game, but I would still suggest you purchase it if you love the series.

												Although I bought Civ:BE around Xmas 2014, due to having a pile of other games I was playing, I didn't actually install it until after buying the RT expansion at Xmas 2015. As a result, I only know the gameplay as a Civ BE:RT player. Having read some not entirely positive reviews, I my expectations were not that high, but I have enjoyed the Civ games since the early days of Civ1, so I figured it was worth a try.After 250hours+ of gameplay, I have to say I have really enjoyed this game. I certainly found it more entertaining than Civ5 (which I also have the two expansions for), and right now I would much prefer to play CivBE:RT than Civ5.I really like the affinities, and I love the way that units auto-upgrade as affinities rise. I enjoy the quests, I like the new diplomacy system, and I think the gameplay is more addictive. Overall, I just enjoy the game.#It does have its faults. The lack of a map editor is an omission - I would really love to play on ""real earth"" maps with this game (with aliens of course!), but it seems none are available and I have read that they are not easy to make. But my impression overall is positive.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In essance, this is Civilization with a story.  This slight change from Civ V and previous games makes it a bit pointless to replay more than 3 times.Overall, the gameplay was good for a 4x game.  What hinders this from being a epic games is added storylines.  The other Civilization games are open-ended.  In essance, you make your own story.  Taking that little feature away made the game only average with little replay value to be had.  It would have been better to call the game anything but Civilization and give the hardcore fans an add-on to Civ 5 that extends gameplay.			",714,277,35,169,105,12,181

At first it seems like a really cool way to introduce new mechanics to research to make the gameplay fresh but after a while you notice a couple of things. Why am I researching any of this? What do I have to research anyway? Why can't I research what I want rather than focus on a single thing and religiously sticking to it or getting mowed down by A.I. players?Buildings/wonders/research - at the tech web, you have absolutely no idea what you're doing. There isn't a single moment like there is in Civ V where you're just like : ""WOAH I CAN BUILD THAT IF I RESEARCH THIS AND DO THAT? OMG YES * throws scientists* "" . Buildings and wonders have almost no effect on the visual side of your city , since most wonders are just big boxes and cubes made out of whatever material. It just seems so bland and cluttered and the long research just turns the game into ""Next Turn Simulator"".Aliens/units - so in this game you can upgrade your units by achieving points in either Harmony , Purity or Supremacy and I have to say that the visual design ( of the player units ) is really cool and it genuienly feels like a reward , especially when your squad of merciless robots takes down a batallion of petty humans. Har har har.HOWEVER the aliens are soooooooooooo bland and most of them feel like rip offs from Mass Effect or  190124 diffirent sci - fi bugs ( seriously? Siege Worms? call BioWare , Thresher Maws are going to have a little talk ). None of them have any soul or variation and they're either annoying because they wreck your entire♥♥♥♥♥♥up when you're about to attack someone else entirely or they can be dealt with by blowing your nose too loudly. There's no balance or middle ground.Gameplay - it's the same old thing. 4X blah blah , but this time we have ORBITAL UNITS. YAY. Or not. The orbital layer barely effects the game at all , and you can ignore it the entire time you're playing. Also THERE ARE NO WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. WHAT? WE SHOULD HAVE NUKES - LAZER KAPOW EDITION BY THIS POINT. TLDR - Don't buy. Go back to Civ V.			",80,6,1,6,3,0,3

												Civ V. It's good, but so was Civ V.I was really, really hoping for Alpha Centauri 2. I wanted it so bad. You have no idea how much I want that. And it was obvious, someone on the team had that idea! There are plenty of references to it, in fact, but it just never gets past that ""50 dollars for a mod of Civ V"" stage.			",83,4,0,11,15,0,10

												It's a pretty good mod for Civilization 5. If it was available for free from the Workshop, made by members of the community, we would all be singing its praises. As it stands, maybe worth $5-10 for the graphics alone but not a title likely to stand the test of time. Review based on the core game only, with no DLC. Supposedly Rising Tide improves the experience but I will be playing more Alpha Centauri while I wait for that price to hit a worthwhile spot.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This was an overall decent game for the civilization series. However, it was not different enough to make up for the extreme lack of playable characters. If you are planning on buying this game, I would wait for more expansions and characters to be released. Civilization 5 was a much better game and I can only hope that this game can catch up to its predecessor.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Civilization Beyond Earth has a lot in common with Civilization V in its gameplay, and some might say that it would just be a clone / DLC of Civilization V and nothing more. I strongly disagree, as this game plays entirely different than any Civilization; the technology tree cannot be remotely compared and involves a strategy of appropriately choosing the correct technologies to acquire the needed amount of points in your desired affinity, these choices also profoundly modifying your development to the point where, you guessed it, you start playing differently than Civilization V (because the number 1 mistake is to play it like you would play Civ V, and not only will you not fair well, but you will also obviously have that feeling of deja-vu).Speaking of affinities, this is where most of my appeal in the game comes from; it genuinely dives into possible future paths for humanity, especially on the themes of transhumanism, extropianism or simply traditional humanism.What else, soundtracks are not as great as in Civ V but I am a personal fan of some sound effects, espcially the ones for the quests.

												So, I bought this game when it first came out. At that time I had tried to play it a few times and just flat out hated it. I never got past the first 20 or so turns. That said, I revisited it yesterday, and now that I've got the ball rolling and I'm learning how to play this one, I really really enjoy it. I like the theme. I like the choices. The units are cool, and having them level up different based on the affinity system is actually a kind of cool thing. I'd set this game between Civ 5 BNW and Civ 6, though after DLC comes out Civ 6 will probably pull ahead. Nonetheless, I definitely recommend this game as well as all the other Civ games, because they're all slightly different and totally worth the time and money.			",64,2,1,6,4,1,9

There is a gap you have to overcome in the beginning where it is hard to care about any nation or any leaders because they don't have a background you already know, so there is no frame of reference, no one to be excited to play.  Each leader grows on you though.  Maybe if they introduced each leader with a cutscene so show which part of earth they came from and their unknown history, which I understand is in the Civopedia.  After you get comfortable and the game feels familiar, it's a lot of fun.  I can't see ever picking anything but supremecy.			",52,8,0,19,2,0,6

												Beyond Earth is good. Perhaps not the best Civ game (at the time of writing this, it's only had a few updates and no post-launch DLC, so there's still time) but certainly far from terrible. The shift to alien planets and post-space cultures is really interesting, and adds some new dimensions to the gameplay. The tech tree has changed considerably as have other core mechanics, whilst still retaining the same structure as previous Civ games.It's not problem free, though. The UI is intensely confusing to start with and feels more like it was designed for its style rather than its functionality. Units and buildings feel less interesting than Civ V, and overall your progression over a period of time is less than in other Civ games. You don't have eras, instead the only real sense of progression comes through increasing your affinities. Leaders have a much smaller set of vocal responses too, and you can hear the same phrase only a few times before getting fed up.But on the whole it is a good game. It's perhaps looking a little weak compared to its siblings, but it is important to remember that Beyond Earth is still in its infancy, with at least one expansion to come. I do, however, think it's worth getting for its aesthetic and its world-building. Firaxis are really trying to make it come alive.			",234,98,7,62,34,2,75

												I'm a huge fan of Civilization V and been playing since Civ 3 and Alpha Centauri.  What this game lacks is 2 things in my view.  Unique characters per faction and any real depth.  I understand that I can't expect the Samurais or Panzer tanks to show up and some would argue that you do get unique units via your choices of idealogy.  It just would have been nice to see a unique unit / buiilding/ terrain enhancement per civ just to make it intriguing to play another faction. The other thing is the real bland interactions between the factions.  Diplomacy is a non factor in this game in my view.  Anyway this game takes 2 steps back from Civ V and was so boring, I'm not even going to buy the DLC packs even if they do remedey these issues.   I mean, after trying to play two games with different factions I was so bored that I went back to play Civilization V.  Really suggest to skip this title in the series.			",5,0,0,0,5,0,6

												I've played this game a lot. A lot. Dozens of games. All sorts of high difficulties. Tons of mods. I'm active in several communities that piece apart issues with the game and try to improve on them, so I know a thing or two about the game's shortcomings.Does it have them? Absolutely. But most of them are behind hours and hours of understanding core game mechanics to know what is and what is not unbalanced. Listen, if you're genuinely interested in Civilization in Space, you'll enjoy this game. If you expect it to be everything Alpha Centauri was and more -- you'll probably be disappointed. If you don't actually like sci-fi and space, you'll probably be disappointed. The game is a gem for those who can appreciate it though. There's very little wrong with the game and the devs are constantly working to remedy that. I look forward to seeing how the game changes with the upcoming DLC Rising Tide.			",37,9,0,6,13,0,11

												This is the single most disappointing game I've ever purchased. Years ago I was a huge fan of alpha centuri and it's adaptation of Civ's mechanics into a science fiction setting, it was genuinely progressive and capitalized on it's setting. You could raise and lower sea levels, mind control cities and drop units into battle from space. Naturally I was incredibly excited to see these ideas revisited with a modern budget and tools.However this is at best a bland re-skin of the Civ games, lacking innovation and left me feeling flat. It's not without merits, the tech web was a great idea and I hope to see it return. I can't recommend the game either buy one of the standard civ games which feel more cohesively designed or if you want the science fiction angle search out a copy of Alpha Centuri in my eyes it's still the superior game.

												I really like this version of Civ. It's really different and while it isn't QUITE as feature rich as Civ VI I really like the sci-fi feel and the completely different victories. The affinity mechanic is also really great. I even find myself wishing I could use the aquatic cities from the expansion when I'm playing Civ VI. Instead of barbarians (which I hate) there are aliens that don't attack if you don't attack them (for the most part) and have more interaction with the player based on their affinity. Honestly, it's freaking great. If you like sci-fi and wish Civ had a sci-fi themed game, this is literally it.*SIDE NOTE* - I got Starships because you can use it with this game and after hating my initial playthrough I replayed it recently after winning a game in Beyond Earth and using it as the starting point makes it like a continuation of the same story and it has much more battle oriented system which was actually a great change of pace and made me really like it. Give it a look too.			",11,6,0,2,11,0,6

												For anyone who is hesitant to buy this game: it is worth it but requires some trust. The vanilla game is a little underpar when compared to Civ 5 vanilla. However, I think the expansions will make Beyond Earth just as good as the Civ 5 staple. Also if you're interested in another 4X game set in space, check out Galactic Civ 3.

												I really like this version of Civ. It's really different and while it isn't QUITE as feature rich as Civ VI I really like the sci-fi feel and the completely different victories. The affinity mechanic is also really great. I even find myself wishing I could use the aquatic cities from the expansion when I'm playing Civ VI. Instead of barbarians (which I hate) there are aliens that don't attack if you don't attack them (for the most part) and have more interaction with the player based on their affinity. Honestly, it's freaking great. If you like sci-fi and wish Civ had a sci-fi themed game, this is literally it.*SIDE NOTE* - I got Starships because you can use it with this game and after hating my initial playthrough I replayed it recently after winning a game in Beyond Earth and using it as the starting point makes it like a continuation of the same story and it has much more battle oriented system which was actually a great change of pace and made me really like it. Give it a look too.			",11,6,0,2,11,0,6

												For anyone who is hesitant to buy this game: it is worth it but requires some trust. The vanilla game is a little underpar when compared to Civ 5 vanilla. However, I think the expansions will make Beyond Earth just as good as the Civ 5 staple. Also if you're interested in another 4X game set in space, check out Galactic Civ 3.  It has similar progression but with different gameplay.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												THis is by far the disappointing Civ game I have played and I have played them all (most heavily - 2, SMAC, 4 & 5). The biggest problems with the game relate to the AI and late game troop movement (1 unit per tile breaks down given the scale of the map and the number of units used in the late game. The AI doesn't understand hw to achieve victory as it doesn't place enough importance on affinities. As maxing an affinity is the key to victory the AI struggles even on the harder difficulties. On top of this the world building is poor, characters are non-existent, no cut scenes of any kind (for constructing building, units or wonders), generally forgettable wonders (both their fluff and crunch) and a extremely poor interface for organising trade routes (the single most important thing after affinities).This game might be ok in MP, but I don't play civ games like that as I don't have the time. If you enjoy Civ for the single player I would recommend Civ 4, SMAC or Endless LEgend over this. It really is poorly put together.			",143,34,1,21,13,0,39

												It's a great game, don't get me wrong, but the depth is serious lacking. They did exactly what they did with Civ 5... release an obviously incomplete game and at a really high price, only for anyone used to the series to realize within a few hours of playing that it needs DLCs to complete it. No doubt those DLCs will be another $40-50 and Faraxis will milk the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of their fanbase.I agree with most of the other high recommended comments about what's lacking, so I won't relist all of that here - it's fairly obvious that Civ 5 with all its expansions is generally a better game, though I DO have hope for this, once DLCs come out and they expand upon the cooler aspects that differentiate this from Civ 5. Generally though: shame on you Faraxis for milking the system.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Since the game was released with massive resolution-detection/refresh rate issues affecting many consumers I can't really recommend it at this point.  AMD Mantle support also leads to consistent crashing on game load, even on supported AMD graphics cards with the CIV:BE-optimized AMD drivers.I've been playing the series since Civ I and this release seems to be lacking the urgency of the previous entries in the series.  It can be considered an Alpha Centauri skin for Civ V, but it just doesn't seem to play as well as Civ V.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												EDIT: Removed a line, restructured a few sentences.This was a learning experience, but not a pleasant one.People have gone so far as to call this a reskin, Civ V in space with nothing substantial added and many key elements removed. They're closer to the truth than I would like to admit.When the game was initially shown off, it looked like Civilization V running a beautiful, polished mod. When the first screens were posted, they showed off a game that was essentially the same as the game before it, down to the damage summation screen. This unspoken (but obvious) similarity continued to shine through with each new revelation.So, really, the question is 'why am I so disappointed playing a game that is exactly what it looked like it was going to be?' The fault in this case may live as much with those of us who had this suspicion and bought anyway as with the developer who knew we'd do just that, but however you place the blame there were choices made in the development of this game that simply must be addressed.Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth shows a clear and unmistakable LACK OF EFFORT. Not only are many systems simply cut-and-pasted over from Civilization V, but even much of the diplomatic and interfacial dialogue is word-for-word the same. Any of the additional personality you would hope for to compensate for a lack of leaders to play is not only missing, it's actually reduced from what Civ V offers. But really, that's not the part I feel is most damaging. No, that's a combination of THE PRICE and, still worse, THE INEVITABILITY OF PAID DLC that will address the obvious oversights made at launch. It feels almost as if this game was stripped of features and released in this state with the intent of giving fans something they would have to keep supporting through DLC to get the experience they thought they had already paid for.I do not recommend this game in this state or at this price, I let my adoration for the former title and the company behind this cloud the evidence offered during the game's development. Patching alone is not going to be enough to fix this game's shallow presentation, and unless the developers commit to MEANINGFULLY improving the experience of this game through a free expansion, I doubt those of us who are currently unsatisfied will feel anything other than exploited by a company we trusted to give us more than they did.

												CIV 5 dumbed down even further. This is what happens when the lead developers favorite civ game is the casual-friendly Civ: Revolutions. I'm not kidding. That's the lead developers favorite and inspiration for this game...and it shows.All the design choices come from Civ: Revolutions, limited amount of cities, limited amount of units (1 of each basic type), minimal player feedback, minimal complex decision making, minimal everything.  I fully expect them to port this game to the Ipad within 6 months since you can tell it was designed with that idea in mind.In addition to being an even more simplistic version of civ than civ 5, which was already pushing its luck with longtime fans. This game also feels unfinished. If you spy on a faction and get caught, nothing happens. They don't confront you or tell you to stop. I stole energy, research, and techs from the same faction over the same game. Got caught repeatedly and they never said a word. Did your city just build something, good luck knowing what it was since the game doesn't tell you. Because why bother tracking how a city is progressing since a casual might have to pay attention over just mashing buttons? Build a wonder? Get a pop-up even MORE minimalist than Civ 5's art box pop-ups. All of your futuristic buildings, no explanations of what they do or any story telling elements like in Alpha Centauri, because casuals can't be bothered to read flavor text I guess. The aliens are very passive, as is the AI overall. Got declared war on once in my first game and am steamrolling it on my first playthrough on hard difficulty.The bottom line is they've managed to dumb civ down to the point were it feels like i'm playing an ipad casual-oriented ""Strategy"" game on my PC, and that sucks, especially coming from firaxis. Avoid this turd. Get endless legend for a similar experience with more imagination. Time to go play CK2 again...			",36,11,0,22,6,0,11

												I have logged over a hundred hours in CIv 5 and loved it and have been excited about this game for months. The description says the game supports Intel HD 3000, however, but since that card can only run DirectX 10 while the game requires 11, while I can nominally play the game, it looks awful and is very frustrating.

												This is not the game to replace Alpha Centauri, which part of me knew before playing. Still, I hoped that maybe this would be a good enough game that I'd get lost playing for hours and hours and hours. A game that I'd download special patches just so it'll continue to work on the new operating systems like I do with Alpha Centauri. Is it? Well, to be honest, I do like it better than the Civilization games. Maybe it's just the setting, because the main mechanics are the same. It's fun to feel like you're exploring a alien world and trying to discover its secrets while staying alive. That aside... it's a game I'll play for a few weeks than move on. Maybe, when I'm craving a turn base stradegy came I'll come back to it.The nation leaders don't particularly have strong personalities. Interactions with them are annoying. I wasn't a fan of having to have an agreement before I could do some trades. Or how favors really didn't add up to much. Or how you lost all your favors with a faction if they decided to go to war. I also don't like how I couldn't talk a leader down from condemning or going to war with me with diplomacy. I just have to sit there and say ""oh. Okay"". Non-stackable units is the most obnixious feature ever. I don't care if it's to make things realistic. I don't like it.The aliens... are dispointing? They're really strong at first and can easily cause issues by killing your colonists, workers, or units you're exploring with. Typically they just sit around, shift around between squares, or linger on your terriority so your workers can't do anything  with that spot. Their behavior doesn't change over time, like it did subtly in Alpha Centauri. They just continue the same boring behavior.The tech web isn't bad, but what's annoying is it doesn't scroll. You're like ""I want to look at the ones over here on the right!"" and you move your mouse that way. Instead of moving, it just sits there. You have to click on the mini  box to change your view. That's just lazy programming. Can't customize units. My biggest issue with Civ games vs. Alpha Centauri was the removal of all the little things like that.If you enjoy Civ games and like the idea of an alien world, this can be a fun game. If you were wanting something more than just another Civ game, you'll be disappointed.This is just another game to pass time with. You probably won't bother playing it at all in a couple of years once a new civ game comes out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Before release I was pretty hyped about this and I actually enjoyed playing my first game since it's a whole new experience, but to be honest It's not even comparable to Civilization V. The lack of leader personalities and that there are no historical reflections at all makes the game a bit worse in my opinion. Also there are no unique units for each civ (8 I think) which makes them all feel basically the same except for the Unique abilites they possess which don't really make any big difference anyways. I also felt that this game was much easier than Civilization V, except for those annoying aliens that are almost as annoying as barbarians but around 5 times as strong.But to be fair I quite enjoyed the objective/quest part of the game, where you completed a objective and recieved materials depending on what quest it was.The franchise should've stayed at earth in my opinion.

												Being a clone of Civilization V is not necessarily a bad thing - Civ V was a lot of fun after all. But Civilization: Beyond Earth is not at all adventurous in trying to offer anything on top of what was already made for Civ V. This is like a glorified mod, with the new features being quite insignificant compared with the overwhelming sameness of the core gameplay. It's still Civilization, and Civiliation has that addictive quality that keeps you coming back, so on that alone it can be recommended. But unless you really like the idea of playing Civ V on an alien world, there's nothing you'll get out of this game that you wouldn't get from just playing Civ V instead.			",296,51,7,43,26,3,44

Beyond earth is a great idea, but has many missing peices that made CIV 5 so monumental. all the factions pretty much feel the same, the AI has a lame personality and attitude. The idea of bringing in a new world with alien was great but gets annoying quick as you blaze down the little buggers. Diplomacy is like dealing with the DMV, might as well punch yourself in the face. so a great idea and maybe in the future it will get better but right now if you want to try a CIV game turn right around and saddle up with CIV 5			",54,5,0,18,12,0,32

												As a lover of all things Civ this game is a glorified sci fi mod and if you've played it for ten minutes you've seen pretty much everything the game has to offer. It's not even CIV V.... IN SPACEEEE!!!!!!!! because they've cut more then they've retextured. Unit's have two options for promotion for example. Heal, or +10% strength. That's it... ever. The Nations are all exactly the same. You get some tiny little bonus here or there but for the most part every talking head is just like the other. You know I'm not even going to waste more time writing this review. The bottom line is this game sucks. I wouldn't recommend it for more then a few dollars and Faraxis lost a lot of my respect and trust when I bought it at full price. They retextured Civ V, took out a lot of the good stuff, and made it as bland as humanly possible. I know you've heard this everywhere else but trust me, this is a very well done mod they are calling a full game. 2/10.			",7,1,0,1,1,0,5

												Difference between CIV 5 and this. This has a very new technology tree (since now we are in space) which I think was a little harder to adapt to but it was aight. The way units are upgraded are different than it was previously.Instead of finding a new technology then paying gold to upgrade existing units you need to accumulate one of your affinities which you can acquire from researching technologies (purity, supremacy, the other one) and you select upgrades for soldiers when you accumulate enough and all your soldiers get upgraded automatically.About a third of resources that existed in CIV 5 still exist here, but there are also a few new ones like geothermal.I feel like the map is about the same as that of CIV 5 just with weird textures to try to make it feel space like, so that's a downside I kind of expected more.Overall its worth a try but I dunno I think CIV 5 and the old system is better. It's a change though.			",16,4,0,1,4,0,3

												If you are a fan of Sid Meier's games, you will enjoy Beyond Earth.  The spirit of Alpha Centauri is channeled into a Civ V feel, but there are enough differences to distinguish this from Civ V.  If you enjoy turn-based strategy games and want to colonize an alien world inhabited by alien flora and fauna, this is a good game for you.  However, I think additional expansions will be necessary to realize the full potential of this game.  The webwork tech progression provides for a variety of strategies, but unit type and progression are more restricted than Civ V.  This makes sense if one understands the influence of Alpha Centauri, but Beyond Earth lacks the unit customization its predecessor enjoyed.  Although because each faction 'evolves' as you advance, some unit customization occurs, but Beyond Earth compensates with interesting city developments which offer orbital capabilities, for example.  Sound interesting?  I recommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Disclaimer: My very large 388 hours was mainly me leaving my PC running after getting bored and wandering off to read books or whatever. I've actually ""played"" the game for a fraction of that time.I have always loved the Civ's, which is why it's very difficult to vote this one down.With a £25 price tag on top of the base game, it's difficult to justify this purely because of it's complete lack of replayability.The good:New factions. This is mainly just because it's something different to try out. I used to play a lot of the SMAC and alternative history faction mods so this was right up my alley.New biomes. The unique world quests were a nice touch, and the biome-specific alien behaviours were exciting to sink my teeth in to. It really changes how you play each game and that lends to replayability.The bad:The diplomacy system, even with the recent patch, was a sad failure at correcting the initial system. It's better, but it didn't quite ""get there"". Yes, there more buttons to press, more things to do... but it's still just as irrelevant as the old system was. Simply put: you work to please your neighboring AI, raising respect and fear... and they declare war anyway? Might aswell go full military build from turn 1.The dev's have done difficulty... wrong. In my view, handicaps != difficulty level. Difficulty level, for civ should equate to smarter, more agressive, less compromising AI. The AI shouldn't simply have ""better stuff"" than you. Yes, people have said that they've beaten this game on top difficulty. No, they didn't say it was fun. Just look at SC2's AI for a good example. The AI there executes unit build orders and issues battlefield commands to ultra tight timing and precision, but crucially, never actually cheats. It's more fun and rewarding, win or lose, to compete on a level playing field against a better opponent. It's never fun to beat an opponent with inbuilt advantages over you - all this shows is that the game is too easy to exploit/AI is dumb.No diplomatic victory conditions. Remember Alpha Centauri, with the UN victory? Bribing players for votes? If you wanted to win diplomatically, you had to play a really cleaver game of plate-balancing to keep all the AI's on your side, while not upsetting any of their rivals too much, and it was really fun. In Rising Tide, there is little reward for keeping the AI happy, since it's far far easier (and safer) to build up a strong military and just crush them.The ugly:Hybrid affinities. They just aren't very useful. Sure, they look cool, but strategicially they don't seem to have any personality of their own despite what the dev's claim. I think that the hybrid affinities should instead have been ""more"" affinities, with more strategic resources to support them.Ocean cities. It's fun at first, but after the initial buzz you begin to realise that sea cities are just... strategically weak, and boring, all at once. It's too hard to expand your territory to get at the resources you need, and there are no defensive terrain features to exploit (mountains, etc...). My game with the NSA was me in the middle of the sea all by myself (save the occasional AI unit wandering by) with almost zero interaction with the other AI's who were all land based. Forever alone.Conclusion:It appears that the dev's do not place any value in good AI for this game, and I feel that this was a grave mistake. With a bit of personality - faction agendas, personal feuds, political backstabbing, secret alliances, taboo strategies (where are the atrocities?) - the game could be a vibrant breeding ground for creative play, and I would be coming back to it again and again. Sadly however, it's effectively a selection of small, shiny-looking and well marketed mods created for a quick cash-in on the fans for little return.4/10. Probably won't village again.

												I find this game to be a great addition to the Sid Meier's collection of Strategic Turn-Based Games. However, my expectations for this game were a bit higher and I hoped that we would experience a game that took the level of colonization and expansion to a more multi-dimensional level, where the game would be started on a planet but eventually grow to create a system of planets and colonies all economically dependent on the player. While this game does not have that function it is still a great addition to the series and has new features that set is apart (and perhaps better) than past Civilization Games. Overall it has been a very rewarding game and a great way to spend my Friday nights.			",3,0,0,0,2,0,4

												It's a good game that deserves better than the rating it has. Too many people are complaining that its just a mod of Civ 5, or that its not as good as Civ 5. In truth, it is very similar to Civ 5, but in my book, that's a good thing. Civ 5 was a great game. What's different than Civ 5? The few most interesting things:1. Game setup is different. You have several choices as to what to bring to the new world, meaning that even two games with the same faction can be played differently.2. The aliens are significantly different from barbarians. They are always there, but not always hostile, and can often be lived with peacefully. Plus, there are giant alien super-units that are very hard to kill.3. Spying is enabled in the base game.4. There's alien gunk called Miasma in a lot of the world that can injure your troops. Similar to what was in Alpha Centauri.5. Affinities. These are almost like religions in other civ games, except that they are not mutually exclusive. You can level up all three affinities simultaneously if you want. Affinities offer unique units and victory conditions.6. There are only a few unit types, but they are upgraded by research into affinities. This actually makes the game easier to manage in my opinion. I like it.7. There are quests, which are kind of like optional mini-objectives that give you a reward if you complete them. It makes the game more interesting by giving you goals to work towards.So the question remains, is this as good as Civ 5? In all honesty, probably not. But that doesn't mean it isn't great in its own right. I have played through 6 or 7 games now, and I am still enjoying it. If you liked Civ 5, and want a new setting, then I definitely recommend you give this one a shot. I give it two thumbs up.			",50,15,0,13,9,0,13

												Beautifully illustrated this game just seems pointless. Its tech web is a mess, movement costs are too high and it feels like Civ5 with slight annoying changes.WHY O WHY cant Sid Meirs bring back WONDER VIDEOS? The game was so cool watching the wonder be built - with this game is down to blueprints of the thing you built.I always start out so optimistic and always find myself not finishing games as it just feel completely aimless - i actually feel like ive just wasted hours of my life - dont get me wrong - its kinda enjoyable, but it just doesnt seem to have a point - and like so many of these types of games there's just so much building going on (which is very very slow) that you dont feel like you're actually playing - just making the odd decision in a sort of 'choose your own adventure' version of alien civdont get me started on the diplomacy side of thingsI'd give it 2.5 stars in its current design			",11,7,0,3,11,0,13

												Extremely dissappointed with this game, a great idea was completey ruined. I'm glad I got it while on sale...not worth the price at all. This level (or lack therof) of quality and innovation of this game is unacceptable for this day and age, and for carrying on a series this far. Firaxis was plain lazy. I find none of the bad elements of Civ are ever remedied in the next sequel.   I have played it twice through and have no desire to play again.Why?  Because:-Just like other civs, game becomes slow, boring grinding turn passing after a certain time, re-confirming a bunch of trade routes every few turns (unless you are doing a global conquest)-Technologies are new but a completely unintuative in their organization and have no real sense of direction, other than to pick the ones needed to fullfil the type of victory aiming for.-AI is idiotic, and as unrealistically backstabbing as usual-Diplomacy has nothing new at all compared to CIV 5, just different leaders and voices (leader 'catch phrases' are lame too) .. 'favours' are new, but almost useless, there is almost no point to communicating with the other nations.-Far less resources to trade compared to other civs-""Happiness"" from civ5 has been replaced with ""Health"" and decreases for the exact same reasons (number of cities, number of specialists, population) which doesn't really make sense and is annoying to try to constantly keep above zero for most of the game.-Landscape is new and pretty is some ways, but I find it overly busy colour wise.- End of game is BORING - STOP making uncreative end-game sequences with absolutely no substance - a screen and a voice saying you won with a small blurb. No score, cinematic, nothing. No one likes an anti-climactic game ending.-""Quests"" (which aren't quests by definition, just a 2 option decision) add little to the game. -Units are fairly dull, no weapons of mass destruction like nukes in other Civ games-miasma is annoying-games are relatively short and small maps compared to other civsPositives-espionage is a little more interesting-option to kill or adopt local alien creatures in different, as is the path and objectives to reach your victory goal-satellites and space layer good idea but not developed enough-pre-game bonus choices a good addition			",11,1,0,14,8,0,20

												I played this game for the Free Weekend, least to say it was a so-so experience.I like the angle of the game delving into the future, and while the civpedia can be a little bland to look at, the information within is quite interesting.Drawing more upon the word bland. It is admittedly artistic wise for non-in game features very bland indeed, everything is painted with a shade of grey. Same for the long-term gameplay, the first hour is very gripping of this game as you grapple with the mechanics and marvel at the strange aliens and eat up all the information the game throws at you.Ok, so i make some solid progress in my first game, even though i played on super easy difficulty for begginers, it was a learning experience drawing upon my CIV 5 knowledge (minimum needed to play this game well) I start up a fresh new game on a different map and it just 'feels' the same, even on ramped up difficulty it feels the same.Unless im totally missing something, the main jumps on difficulty settings do not matter as it merely changes few factors such as how soon Civ's arrive (in game context you are first to land, and the earlier you get there, the more time you have to set up by game rules) and how sassy and rude franko-iberia (the 'cultural civ') is to you.To stop myself dragging too far on, a summary.- User interface is unpolished and unclear - Unable to clearly see the orbital view unless it is pointed out to me or trade routes from UI, same for saying i have no idea where my trade routes go or what slots are open unless i activate it on the map modes which are drum roll please... ""hidden in the map with a small cursor""- Civ's are not as imaginative as thier names, have broad abilities to each that you forget about in game unless you look them up or actively seek to use them.- Too many bottleneck technologies such as ecology (for removing misama fart gas), and some parts of the tech tree are messy in terms of progress- Very passive AI for both aliens and other civs if you don't raise a gun at all they leave you alone (my first attempt was actually harmony alignment - (Learn more about it in the game) and i didn't need to kill a single alien, plus i harboured a nest so that they'd go away elsewhere and attack other people whilst i ate all the xenomass resources - win - win)- Quests are too frequent and powerful with effects that literally buff everything in sight making the game too easy.Unfortunately it feels more like a very well polished mod for CIV 5, rather than a civ game of its own, and unless i am simply too MLG with my strategies to play the game as intended, other than for one or two incidents ill never feel the true wrath of the godlike siegeworm as it takes away everything precious from me.Still, i would recommend this game since they are hosting a new expansion soon which will hopefully add more meat onto the bones and make it less convouluted. For the meantime the free weekend is still up so grab it while you can and see for yourself. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

If you want a Civ sci-fi experience go find a copy of Alpha Centauri, it accomplishes everything this game does and more.I thought the expansion would bring new life into the game but instead it actually took even more options and freedom OUT OF the game.

												Civilization Beyond Earth has a lot in common with Civilization V in its gameplay, and some might say that it would just be a clone / DLC of Civilization V and nothing more. I strongly disagree, as this game plays entirely different than any Civilization; the technology tree cannot be remotely compared and involves a strategy of appropriately choosing the correct technologies to acquire the needed amount of points in your desired affinity, these choices also profoundly modifying your development to the point where, you guessed it, you start playing differently than Civilization V (because the number 1 mistake is to play it like you would play Civ V, and not only will you not fair well, but you will also obviously have that feeling of deja-vu).Speaking of affinities, this is where most of my appeal in the game comes from; it genuinely dives into possible future paths for humanity, especially on the themes of transhumanism, extropianism or simply traditional humanism.What else, soundtracks are not as great as in Civ V but I am a personal fan of some sound effects, espcially the ones for the quests.

												So, I bought this game when it first came out. At that time I had tried to play it a few times and just flat out hated it. I never got past the first 20 or so turns. That said, I revisited it yesterday, and now that I've got the ball rolling and I'm learning how to play this one, I really really enjoy it. I like the theme. I like the choices. The units are cool, and having them level up different based on the affinity system is actually a kind of cool thing. I'd set this game between Civ 5 BNW and Civ 6, though after DLC comes out Civ 6 will probably pull ahead. Nonetheless, I definitely recommend this game as well as all the other Civ games, because they're all slightly different and totally worth the time and money.			",64,2,1,6,4,1,9

												I was very skeptical about buying this game thanks to all the mixed reviews. Waited till it was on sale and snatched it up for $15.Just to make it clear, this game is not Civilization 5. On my first game I had the high expecations I have of Civ 5 in it's complete state but this game was nothing like that. I kind of got bored, powered through turns but eventually found interest in the different gameplay and techs. Second game was a lot better, I had a better understanding of how everything worked and removed the whole ""Why isn't this like Civ 5"" mentality from my head. The game was worth the $15 and I will get another few games out of it before moving on. But it definitely needs some improvement. Some negative points:- The diplomacy is awful. Just don't either bother, you can't work with the AI, declare war on everone.- Games are quite short.- Aliens pose no real threat and are just a time waster.- Is not Civ 5			",62,5,0,6,12,0,14

												First off, this is a great strategy game in its own right.That said, compared to its kinda predecessor Civ V, it is a bit lacking in pacing and depth. Like Civ V before it, it will probably improve with expansions though.Pros:-Beautiful graphics-Cool aesthetic feel-Solid mechanics (for the most part)-Allows freedom of planning through tech web and starting bonusesCons:-Trade system is annoying-AI is aweful-Aliens are a novelty that runs out fast-bad game pacingIn all a good game, and would probably be regarded higher if Civ V wasn't way better ",33,5,0,10,8,0,7

												With the ""Rising Tide"" expansion, this is an improvement over Civ V.  The ultimate test, yes it does have that ""one more turn feeling""1. The Science Fiction setting, with the ability to start on several various types of alien worlds, from the earth like ""Lush"" to the very un-earth like ""fungal."" Each offering different types of challenges and curiosities to explore. 2. The affinity system. You improve your civilizations military not just by unlocking new technologies, but by upgrading your platforms along the lines of your affinity. This gives your units a completely different look and feel, plus different bonuses and abilitites as they develop from other players who develop a different affinity. Whereas in Civ V, every civ had very generic units, with a unique thrown in here and there. Also the use of certain technologies requires a baseline affinity level, and diplomatic relations are affected. 3. The alien fauna. Adds to the feel of exploring an alien world. They are unpredictable, but you can either attempt to tame, coexist, and ultimately use them to your advantage, or attempt to wipe them out. 4. Terraform the planet to make it into a new Earth, OR change humanity to live in harmony with the world. 5. Strategic resources matter more. Strange in Civ 5 how oil is important for early modern units, but suddenly all you need is aluminium?  6. The orbital layer. Neat. Includes fun toys such as orbital laser beams to turn the tide in war, and even global teleporters.  The game could use some improvements in the following areas:1. The AI, of course. I did find the game challenging and fun at the ""Soyuz"" level, with alien fauna cranked up to ""frenzied,"" where the AI would finally credibly threaten you, and aliens would make life difficult for all. Very easy before that. The AI should aggresively pursue an affinity and be more willing to attack the player with sufficient units to do serious damage. AI does not seem to aggresively pursue a victory however. 2. Would like to see the orbital layer fleshed out more. Sattelites have more options to defend themselves from strikes, and sattelites to kill other sattlelites. Maybe add a space crusier that flies through the orbital layer, bombards and carries fighters toward the end game. Maybe space fighters too instead of just ground support or air to air attack air units. 3. Would like to see more ""super weapons."" Nukes are missing. Controlling the orbital layer to prevent nukes would be key here. Fortifications and something like the ""citadel"" in civ V would be nice. Maybe let players build rail guns on the map to bombard at range.  4. Would also like to see players be able to damage cities and population with air strikes, assaults, and bombardment to reflect the brutality of war.  It takes too long to raze larger cities. You should also be able to damage tile improvements at range with artillery or air power.			",13,9,0,8,3,0,20

												Though not as good as Civ V GOTY, I enjoy this much more than vanilla Civ V, and I like the new mechanics such as affinities and the technology ""web"". Both could use some brushing up. The game could be much more bold in the scifi direction, but the upcoming DLC is supposed to fix that.			",119,22,6,10,15,1,16

												Well damn. I really hoped this game would be good, but when it's so much worse than Alpha Centauri which came out 15 years ago, and is worse than Civ. 5, which was made by the same studio, it gets dumb. If you want a game like this, get alpha centauri, it's got worse graphics obviously, but for a game made 15 years ago, is leagues above Civ. Beyond Earth.			",44,1,0,5,5,0,7

												This is the most diappointing installment in the Civilization series in some time. It's hard to get beyond the ugly UI and terrain. If all you want, though, is to play Civ 5 in space and you're not concerned about the downgrade in appearance, they you'll love this game.For a fresh look at a Civ type game, I encourage players to look at Endless Legend. Endless Legend is more innovative than anything Sid Meier has put out in a long time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Intro Movie Check!, Loading Screen? Oh oh, though I'm not affected by this one a large number of people on the forums are.Being unable even to start again!, Pick your factions, pick your world, soon as the map appears? Crashes, 100% of the time.Try the demo to see if it even works for you though there is no guarantee that the full game would, would advise anyone to not even concider buying until we can be assured it will actually work.

												If you like turn based games, you are going to like Civ: Beyond Earth. It has the best and most fun elements of Age of Empires and Risk and that in a neat looking futuristic theme. There are a lot of diferent and complex, yet coherent mechanics which are explained very well in the early game. For instance, you have the questing system, which explains you how you should play the game but at the same moment it is an important mechanic that you'll keep on using as the game progresses. You can play against the AI with advanced diplomatic options (at first I thought that I was playing against real humans, so there's that :P), but it is even more fun when playing against your friends.I dare you, play a hundred turns and try to not get addicted. I bet you can't :D			",24,5,0,2,1,0,3

												Managed 24hrs in the free weekend, some of my thoughts on the limited time I had with vanilla Beyond Earth:The AI is pretty awful . I performed a coup d'etat mission with one of my spies (after another AI spent about 15 turns bombing the capital but not bothering to take over it), the AI leader wasn't even mad I took the capital, no denouncing or declaring war, in fact further on in the game the leader was friendly towards me. They didn't even attempt taking back their own capital.The content is fairly lacking and the leaders are incredibly generic. I understand the reasoning for not wanting 'Gandhi in space', but at least have some backstory. I really couldn't tell you the difference between any of the leaders aside from their physical appearance. This is a large problem for me because one of the things I loved about Civ V was the personality of the leaders. In Beyond Earth, they are all the same, and they are dull.The orbital layer is a welcome new addition to the franchise, unfortunately I found most of the units either boring or useless to me. The only one I really used was the ability to create new strategic resources on unworked tiles.The Affinities is an interesting idea with Purity, Harmony and Supremacy. I'm not sure however that I liked they were tied to the Tech Web. I maybe would have liked to pre-select an Affinity or use them like Virtues and amass and spend Affinity points during the game.  I probably need to spend more time in the game to have a solid impression on that.Some of the units, especially Harmony's, are really good. Unfortunately the upgrade system is very uninspired and boring with only 2 options available.I think a certain youtuber said it best when he said that the game was, ""Bound by it's theme"", I think that perfectly sums up vanilla Beyond Earth. I love the theme, but their is just a stark lack of content. I think the inevitable future expansions will fix a large amount of these problems, but vanilla Beyond Earth isn't worth buying, and therefore I cannot recommend it for now.			",249,65,17,19,21,8,42

												Honestly, I prefer Civ V. While BE included a few new elements, they removed about as much as they added and most of the things added seemed trivial or down-right bad. I feel that the things  that were added just didn't make up for the things that were lost. Here is a list of things that were added and taken away:Added:-Tech web instead of a line, useful-Senerios where you can choose new benefits for things, not very useful but not horrible-Factions with special benefits, didn't like-Cool alien things instead of barbarians-A storyline of sorts for victories (just a diary entry or something)Removed:-Religon and tourism-Dumbed down city-states-Lots fewer civs and maps to choose from- Less difficulties to play on-No great peopleAlso, I liked the journey through history sort of thing from Civ 5 better. The graphics are great and gameplay was okay but when it comes down to it,  Civ 5 is much better.			",141,26,1,22,30,1,38

Yes, the expectations were very high to start with, BUT Sid Meier's Civilization® have always and always meant going beyond whatever level of expectation they were challenged with.There is a reason why this title is not Civilization ""6"".

												what i like/love: 1.quest system2.affinity(unlike most ppl, i rather enjoyed the fact that it gave you a little something for your choices, not that it really did much of...anything diffrent, but if they made it so the affinites were actully diffrent, other then in looks, then it would be very good, i more so just enjoyed the concept.)3. aliens(very similar to barbarians, but....diffrent)4.spacey enviroment5. tech webwhat i didnt like: 1. lack of affinty...difference(it, really, just changed the looks for the most part)2. the trade stations are utter crap, they are just worse versions of city states3. lack of naval units, and lack of air units(one air units and i beliove only 2 naval units).in conclusion: Beyond Earth is, really, just a slightly diffrent version of civ. 5 set in the future. It is, however, better in some areas, while suprisingly lacking in others. Beyond Earth didnt live up to my expectations, fro, there only being 8 civs to pick from, to the lack of new and exiting units, or the lack of new content i bought this game to see, is mostly a disapointment, BUT, and there is a bad, this game is, by no means, a bad game, it just feels like im playing civ. 5 and spent 60 bucks for no good reason other then to see a pretty alien world and good looking affinity troops.

												I have played through several times now. I've got mixed feelings.Nice is automatic upgrades of units rather than having to spend money to upgrade them(which meant I often had very antique units in my Civ games guarding cities). Nice is the sci-fi elements (no more General Ghandi to worry about). Nice are some of the units, although it takes too long in game to get really sci-fi'ish units unless you're playing harmony. Mostly, tanks, troops, jets. Overall, I found the game a bit tedious. Too many turns seem to go by with nothing really happening. This is a risk with turn based 4x games, but so far this seems particularly grindy.Aliens are underdone, more an annoyance and easily eliminated as a factor early in the game. They get to be mobile scenery very quickly once you get purity level 1 and the fence with only the Manticores being a bother. Explorers quickly come to ignore aliens and this lets you move and build your colonies in alien infested areas as you can stack the two. They aren't even ""real"" aliens, they are more like alien wildlife. The Siege Worms are currently the most underwhelming part. Something is bugged with the bugs' aggressiveness. That said, given the number that seem able to spawn early in the game when there's still a lot of fog of war, under aggressive is probably better than overaggresive Not stacking units seemed ok given ranged units are more common. But, every map I've place has LOTS of blocking terrain (mountains and canyons). Late game, canyons become less an issue as floaters and large walkers become available.  However, before they are available, choke points become more of a factor. There is no mountain crossing unit I've found yet and aircraft seem to frequently have too little range to reach enemy cities. There is a teleporter sattellite but that leads to the next problem:Orbital units can be expected to not last 1 turn once your cold wars go hot. they will IMMEDIATELY be shot down by the enemy. I have yet to see an option that allows them to survive the first anti-orbital strike. Orbital lasers, teleporters, etc, are best put out of range of cities, which is a strategy and sometimes gets you around the terrain problems. However, orbital units cannot overlap coverage, making it difficult to place more than one at a time. They also have limited duration before they deorbit, making maintenance of your orbital network a manual process. It makes a new feature an also-ran. You have to use them, but the best orbitals are solar collectors(virtually mandatory to keep your energy levels high in the mid game and even into the late game) and  miasma removers(early on before workers get the option or you get far enough on the harmony track to ignore it).  The ""offensive"" orbitals end up being either defensive or single use bombs. That would be ok, but you can't even build an orbital in a city if you have one ""on the launch pad"". Also, there seems to be no list I can find that lists WHERE unlaunched orbitals are waiting, which can be annoying if you don't write it down or forget.The ""you win"" or ""you lose"" screens are just horrible. A bit of text and a back ground image. It doesn't even scroll and I have yet to find a game summary screen of any sort. Just ""you win"".  The ""contact"" victory text and ""you lose"" in particular are horrid.  I lost one game simply because I forgot to pay attention to the AI's progress on victory, but the text telling me I lost told me nothing, so I don't even know what conditions it won on or which AI player won. Ultimately, this is a spiritual successor to Alpha Centari, but there are a lot of issues that bog it down. I'm giving it a ""not recommended"" because there's no ""mixed feelings"" selection. While I'm not the kind that demands every game have a huge story, the lack of  background info and meaningful end game text is very disappointing.			",51,7,1,17,28,0,26

												As many others have already mentioned, Beyond Earth basically just feels and looks like a Civilization V mod. That by itself might not have been such a big deal if Beyond Earth was as fleshed out as its predecessor.As of this review it has not been 2 weeks since the game was released and we have not even seen a patch to fix high priority issues with the game (for instance the fact that anyone with a 120hz or higher monitor cannot select 1080p or higher resolutions, I use a 1440p 144hz screen and the only way I can get the game to allow me to use anything higher than 720p or so is to run it in windowed mode, which is hardly acceptable).I persevered and played through an entire match and frankly I never really felt as engaged as I do with Civilization V matches. That one match was enough for me to learn the following about the game:Beyond Earth has virtually no personality at all.The leaders have phrases literally copy-pasted from Civilization V.There's even less reason to interact with the AI than there is in Civilization V trade-wise.The Aliens are only really threatening during the early-game before you pick up any points in an affinity.The Tech Web is downright painful to look at, and it's difficult to tell where wonders are in the web. There is at least one mod I know of that improves this but since mods also disable achievements..Tooltips are missing in certain areas - for instance nowhere does it mention that buildings that give health work much like the ones in Civ V (where a building that gives 5 happiness will only give 2 happiness in a city with 2 population).If Beyond Earth didn't feel like a cheap Civilization V mod I might have been able to forgive most of this, but there's no excuse for the game to be missing so many details when the codebase is so similar. I'm just glad I didn't buy Beyond Earth on Steam where it would have cost me $90 AUD (Though for the $50 it did cost me I'm still very disappointed).That's another thing. A while ago this game was a lot cheaper on Steam for Australian customers, and then out of nowhere 2K raised the price to its current $90 without so much as an explanation. I had to hunt down a copy on an external site just to get a reasonable price.All in all, given all the issues with the game, the bare-bones nature of the game compared to Civilization V, the current price and the lack of any fixes or any real communication from Firaxis or 2K in 2 weeks, I'd STRONGLY advise anyone that was considering buying Civilization: Beyond Earth to wait until either the next major Steam sale or until the first expansion is released. It seems that Firaxis chose to ignore the lessons they should have learned from Civilization V's launch.I do not normally bother to give games negative reviews (or reviews at all, for that matter), so this should impress on you just how disappointed I am with Civilization: Beyond Earth in its current state.

But, I had faith in the developers and the franchise, mingled with a LOT of fond nostolgia for Alpha Centari.  This will be the last time I ever do this.  They burned me bad.This game is just bad.  On so many different levels.  Artistically, it was a massive drop for the franchise.  It was painful to look at and try to see what was going on.

What unit?If this were a free mod in the Steam Workshop for Civ V, it would have been noted and passed over.  As a full retail game, this was a train wreck.I will not purchase your DLC, Firaxis.

												This game is beautiful, and it has an atmosphere that I've never really felt before. It really does feel like a Civilization game set on some planet out in the cosmos. The artwork is gorgeous, the aliens are a fun change from barbarians, and the gameplay really does feel like a struggle to survive a new environment.However, everything great about this game is balanced out by everything wrong with this game. It just feels like the game engine and system are very poorly optimized. Frame rates vary wildly, and textures don't cache leading to texture loading errors. The game crashes often, some quests are bugged, dialogue boxes are bugged, and you never get the sense of security to enjoy the game.Every time I play this, I have a wonderful time that is marred by the constant worry of game crashes, bugged out missions, or game freeze inducing dialogue boxes.Despite the fact these bugs are well reported, no major bug fixing patch has been made, instead the focus was on creating new DLC. Any time a company focuses on DLC instead of fixing the product for their existing customers gets an automatic downvote from me.This morning the game crashed so hard it led to a BSOD, needless to say I'll be uninstalling this game until it's fixed.

												At first glance I loved this expansion but sadly, it is still not even close to Civ V. It's missing key components that break the game for any strategy but a war based empire.1. Warscore broken: You can pound a nation into the dirt for several turns, but without a land unit near their city to threaten taking it, they will never surrender. This means naval nations built on trade are rendered useless. Wars will start you can never finish.2. Diplomacy: While there are some neat improvements since the original, the new system lacks key components.... such as defensive alliances. Ally with a small power and they will use your power to declare war on a big guy. Not a broken issue, makes sense, but the lack of options for pacts and agreements make the diplomacy system not even half what earlier Civ games were.Do NOT recommend this game. Wait till they come out with more expansions to fix the broken issues, then wait till it's on sale in a gold bundle so you aren't ripped off for each individual release.Sorry Sid Meiers, you've lost a fan.EDIT: SInce the expansion, massive improvements to diplomacy. Not sure if I like what is done, but definately less broken. Warscore still an issue...			",28,12,1,19,15,0,31

												I'm... not sure what to say about this game. It's basically just Civ 5 re-skinned and put in a shiny new package. I was very disappointed when I first got this game, and, looking back, I feel that way again.I have no desire to attempt another go at it. Try harder next time.Cheers!-Camolot			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sorry I love the Civ series but this does not do it for me. Its same old same old. I looked at Anno 2205 and the graphics! OMG, seriously THIS is what Civ Beyond Earth should have looked like. I want to see evolution! in fact revolution how a game works looks and feels not outdated graphics from 1990.

												I want to love this game, I've played many hours and would play more, but it has a huge issue that others have also experienced that completely kills the immersion into the game.  See the discussion on Steam ""Civilization Beyond Earth Attack animations Broken"".  If it weren't for this bug I would be able to highly recommend this game.  Myself and others have opened support tickets with 2K and are still waiting for response.  Even with a good gaming system you can still experience this problem.			",14,1,0,4,6,0,19

												Beautifully illustrated this game just seems pointless. Its tech web is a mess, movement costs are too high and it feels like Civ5 with slight annoying changes.WHY O WHY cant Sid Meirs bring back WONDER VIDEOS? The game was so cool watching the wonder be built - with this game is down to blueprints of the thing you built.I always start out so optimistic and always find myself not finishing games as it just feel completely aimless - i actually feel like ive just wasted hours of my life - dont get me wrong - its kinda enjoyable, but it just doesnt seem to have a point - and like so many of these types of games there's just so much building going on (which is very very slow) that you dont feel like you're actually playing - just making the odd decision in a sort of 'choose your own adventure' version of alien civdont get me started on the diplomacy side of thingsI'd give it 2.5 stars in its current design			",11,7,0,3,11,0,13

												Extremely dissappointed with this game, a great idea was completey ruined. I'm glad I got it while on sale...not worth the price at all. This level (or lack therof) of quality and innovation of this game is unacceptable for this day and age, and for carrying on a series this far. Firaxis was plain lazy. I find none of the bad elements of Civ are ever remedied in the next sequel.   I have played it twice through and have no desire to play again.Why?  Because:-Just like other civs, game becomes slow, boring grinding turn passing after a certain time, re-confirming a bunch of trade routes every few turns (unless you are doing a global conquest)-Technologies are new but a completely unintuative in their organization and have no real sense of direction, other than to pick the ones needed to fullfil the type of victory aiming for.-AI is idiotic, and as unrealistically backstabbing as usual-Diplomacy has nothing new at all compared to CIV 5, just different leaders and voices (leader 'catch phrases' are lame too) .. 'favours' are new, but almost useless, there is almost no point to communicating with the other nations.-Far less resources to trade compared to other civs-""Happiness"" from civ5 has been replaced with ""Health"" and decreases for the exact same reasons (number of cities, number of specialists, population) which doesn't really make sense and is annoying to try to constantly keep above zero for most of the game.-Landscape is new and pretty is some ways, but I find it overly busy colour wise.- End of game is BORING - STOP making uncreative end-game sequences with absolutely no substance - a screen and a voice saying you won with a small blurb. No score, cinematic, nothing. No one likes an anti-climactic game ending.-""Quests"" (which aren't quests by definition, just a 2 option decision) add little to the game. -Units are fairly dull, no weapons of mass destruction like nukes in other Civ games-miasma is annoying-games are relatively short and small maps compared to other civsPositives-espionage is a little more interesting-option to kill or adopt local alien creatures in different, as is the path and objectives to reach your victory goal-satellites and space layer good idea but not developed enough-pre-game bonus choices a good addition			",11,1,0,14,8,0,20

												Played one full game on the free weekend, I have to say I totally agree with everything said here.Its different enough from CivV to make you look, has some interesting features, but ultimately its just CivV with a coat of paint. Really this should have been a DLC for CivV at 1/4 the price or something...			",732,242,46,87,129,16,156

												This game is the 4x/turn based version of sid meiers star citizen. never before have i felt so betrayed by developers. They took my money and spent it on hookers and blow, and all they gave me was a mod for civ V. All the reviewers who gave the game above 8 should be shot, plain and simple. This is Firaxis becoming EA.			",88,12,0,21,30,0,51

												Fun for a few hours, played this for free when it was available for the weekend.would not recommend this for the full price, not even above 10€ for that matter.Basically Civ 5 but with a different skin and new tiles, resources, units and buildings.I'm not saying this is a bad game, I just wouldn't recommend it.If you play Civ 5, don't buy it. If you havent bought Civ 5 and you like space, sure go ahead.The AI isn't that social, the new tech tree web is an amazing feature imo, but that's about it.			",119,24,1,17,37,1,15
