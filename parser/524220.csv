												Where to even start with this game? I just finished 100%'ing it after 68 hours and I am in a state of pure awe of what I just witnessed playing through this game.This will be a different type of review than my other ones, because I have a lot of things to get off my chest after going through this. It will have Pro/Cons at the end, but it will be a very ""personal"" review.I will start by saying that I haven't played a Yoko Taro directed game before, but I have heard a lot of great things about his weird world that he has created that links between multiple games and franchises (Nier/Drakengard respectively) so I was really excited when I heard that Square decided to give him a good budget and a very well known studio for their character action games (Platinum) to make a sequel to the original Nier from the previous generation. So without any doubt and after hearing that it got a PC release I instantly purchased it, because I was fascinated by what Yoko Taro could do.And what a fantastic job he and his team at Platinum Games have done. A game that shouldn't be passed on by ANYONE, because it does something that I, personally, haven't encountered in a game before (which I won't spoil here, because you HAVE TO experience it yourself).Imagine a Platinum game that has exquisite combat, a director that is so masterful in how he presents the story giving small information and tidbits as you go along and a soundrack by a composer that is well known (Keiichi Okabe) that you take a few moments from playing the game just to listen to the music..it's THAT GOOD.I won't go much into the story of the game, because it's very easy to spoil, but the story and overarching plot is so well done and it makes you question a lot of things about humanity, emotions, life itself and many other things.Now onto the more technical side of things I will go for Pro/Cons..conclusion and a small PS at the end of it.Pro:- Unforgettable story (Yoko Taro at his finest)- Outstanding soundtrack (Keiichi Okabe)- Fluid combat gameplay a la Bayonetta/Metal gear Rising Revengeance- Multiple weapons/combination alongside a robust RPG system (that includes crafting, leveling, skills etc)- Good cast of main characters and NPC's- Multiple endings + True Ending- Good PC port (turn off AA if you want performance boost..MSAA ruins your framerate)- Open World- Side quests (some of them are worth doing..for the rest see cons)- Arbitrary resolution support- 60fps (albeit still locked and can't go higher)- The color palette of this game although it looks a bit washed out it FITS with the setting- Multiple difficulty settings for both casuals and hardcore players that want to test their mettle- Codex for enemies/weapons/items/story for weapons that unlock via upgrading themCons:- Side quests that include a lot of backtracking (I think this was intentional so you can keep your focus on the main narrative)- 30fps cutscenes that are locked at 900p and they sometimes also drop in framerate (they are jarring when transitioning from a 60fps in game scene to a 30fps with drops in a cutscene)- A few technical bugs regarding Fullscreen that can be patched- Grinding for materials and chips (aka bonuses) is required if you want to play at higher difficulty levelsConclusion and overall thoughts:This has been an eye opening experience that I will never forget. From the amazing soundtrack by Keiichi Okabe to the wonderful directing and story by Yoko Taro and the combat by Platinum games..they all mesh together to create one of the best Action RPG's that I have ever played. Yes, the fetch quests can be tedious and grinding can be a pain at times to achieve everything this game has to offer, but I did not waver and was fascinated by this world. I really hope this game sells well enough so that Square greenlits a remaster of Nier 1 on PC. PS: THANK YOU SQUARE ENIX, YOKO TARO, KEIICHI OKABE, PLATINUM GAMES & EVERYONE INVOLVED FOR CREATING THIS AMAZING GAME! PPS: If you've read until this point I want to thank you for doing so and urge you to go and buy this game, because it's one of those games that doesn't deserve to be forgotten in a slew of big releases (Horizon, Zelda, Mass Effect Andromeda) and the reason why it's going to be my GOTY this year.I will now post a quote from Jim Sterling's review that resonated with me so much that I cannot state it better as an ending to this lenghty review:""Nier itself is important. It is, as far as I’m concerned, historically significant in terms of its design and the way in which it uses the framework of a videogame to tell an evolving story. If I had my way, every budding game developer would play this game to the point of acquiring endings A, B, C, D, and E before acquiescing to its final and alarmingly direct request.Few games are able to showcase the power of the medium like Nier: Automata.If history forgets this game, then ♥♥♥♥ history.""

Resolution is not locked at 1080p! FPS capped at 60.Just a quick heads-up for people on the fence because of a possible resolution lock: There seems to be none!  (to a maximum of 4k at least) I'm able to play the game at 2560x1440 without problems. There is a 60fps cap! Fixing the Fullscreen Resolution BugSome users report problems with the full screen mode. If you have problems running the game fullscreen with your intended resolution, try the small application called Borderless Gaming. You can find it on github. Run the game in Windowed Mode and select Nier: Automata in the tool. Voila, you are playing the game in Borderless Windowed mode now! Until SE provides a fix for Fullscreen, use this tool. It's easy and quick.PerformanceDespite the Fullscreen Bug, the port seems to be running smoothly and at a steady 60fps! I'm playing with a GTX 980ti, so it should be expected to run fine. (I had no problems with the resolution and fullscreen, it seems to vary between systems.) Screenshot of the resolution settings:

Controls & Keyboard SettingsIt is possible to configure and remap Keyboard settings. I didn't try to play it with keyboard, but it seems pretty straight forward and it is customizable. Still, a controller is recommended, since the game was designed around it.Screenshot of the Keyboard settings:

Gameplay & MusicThe music in this game will leave you speechless. Like in the first Nier, the music in this game is a real treat. Almost every track has multiple versions. The game even changes the music ""layers"" during boss fights and events to sync it with the fight! It enhances the experience tenfold. A similar technique was used in Metal Gear Rising aswell, which is another game by Platinum.I will update my review regarding the gameplay later. There are more than enough reviews up from the PS4 version, which was released almost 2 weeks ago. Look it up! But i can assure you, its top notch!			"

												SPOILER-FREE REVIEW(as much as possible...)Remember when games were released in a finished state? No season-pass, no crazy pre-order bullsh.it, no micro transactions of any sort... While Nier: Automata had some minor release problems, the PC release is still the best version between the two on offer. The customization in the options menu is enough to satisfy people, with fully rebindable controller layouts, extensive camera adjustment, and if you have a rather good rig then you're ready to enjoy the game how it's meant 2B.Let's look at the bad things first, which I think can be fixed later down the line. The  game launched with a fullscreen bug that caused the game to render at a resolution lower than the one set while in true fullscreen mode, which was fixed with solutions from Borderless Gaming and a number of modders. Apart from that, texture/object pop-in is equivalent to the PS4 version, with grass and trees often appearing abruptly in the city area, though monsters aren’t affected. Oddly, the pre-rendered cutscenes are locked at 900p 30fps, a shame, but the story remains gripping nonetheless!Now let's talk about some points that make this game my new favorite game ever. Nier: Automata's combat system is a perfect mix of Action RPG, Bullet Hell and Shmup as well as many other genres. The hack and slash combat feels just fluid thanks to every button press having an actual impact on what your character does as well as the well done combo system. The game seamlessly transitions between theses different genres and camera angles in a really interesting way.The difficulty has some flaws but is overall well done. Normal feels too easy at some points and Hard basically two-shots you in every situation and requires you really get the dodge down. Other players corpses are a good indicator when something challenging is coming up, and they can even be revived to fight alongside you. Just like the souls-series, you drop a corpse at the point of death which can be retrieved to collect some xp as well as some of your skill chips. Die twice without collecting it and you can say goodbye to some of your skill chips. Other then leveling up through battle, you can equip passive skill chips that further enhance your gameplay. Regenerating health outside of battles, increased evade distance, or even a certain chance to reflect damage back at the attacker; there are many ways to individualize your playstyle.In terms of graphics, the game is mighty fine but some could say it looks outdated while it is clearly not. The fantastic looking post-apocalyptic world design just adds to that fact that this game can be very pretty at some points. Enemies might look the same early on, but there’s quite a bit of diversity across the 60+ enemies you’ll find across your journey.To talk about some positive technical aspects of the game, it runs well at a capped 60fps with a decent rig, with only minor drops for some in areas have large amounts of enemies. Performance can be improved substantially by lowering the Global Illumination samples with the help of a certain mod; a notable bump with almost zero visual difference. There are no loading times between the different areas of the game, only when using the fast travel system (no more than 5-10 seconds).As well as the nicely done English voiceover, they also provide the option of using the original Japanese VO, something not every game coming to the west does and is very welcome. In my opinion, Japanese voice with English subtitles is the way to go for this one, as they manage to make the game feel much more impactful and emotional than English will ever be able to achieve.And now for one of the best aspects, the magnificent soundtrack. The game often shifts dynamically between 7 different variations (instrumental, vocal, 8-bit, etc) of each song to suit different scenarios in a way that I’ve never experienced in a videogame, it's just beautiful. There are even special songs for every completed side-quest based on your choices; how cool is that?The real meat of the game however, lies in the story. Put simply, planet Earth is overrun by machines that made the last of mankind flee to the moon. They then build androids to combat and ultimately rid the Earth of those machines and return home. Working for the project known as YoRHa, you play as the android 2B, who is supposed to be calm and composed, and fight alongside your companion 9S, a reconnaissance android with a much more emotional personality.While I can't go into details at the risk of spoiling it, I urge you to try to experience all 26 endings (A-Z), or at least the first five (A-E). The game does a bad job of letting people know that there is much more beyond just the first playthrough. If you don't have any questions after your first run, then I really don’t know what you were doing... Each playthrough changes various aspects of the game and story, and you don’t even get to see 7 of the game’s 17 chapters unless you stick around till at least the third playthrough. A reasonable ask, as I genuinely don’t think you’ll be bored of it at that point, just don’t spend too much time on the crazy sidequests as you’ll get the chapter select after the third run to go back and do everything you forgot (plus achievement hunting).While having some minor flaws, all of this combined makes this one of the greatest games ever made. It's easy to ignore this game if you don’t think you’ll be good at action rpgs, bullet hell, and shmups, or if you think it looks outdated, but there’s so much more to it than that... So just try to get over the little problems and play this masterpiece!Nier: Automata is absolutely a must-play for anyone that considers themselves a “gamer”, there’s just so much here to enjoy.I’ll end this with a fitting quote from Jim Sterling:""Nier itself is important. It is, as far as I’m concerned, historically significant in terms of its design and the way in which it uses the framework of a videogame to tell an evolving story.If history forgets this game, then fu.ck history.""

												So after ~90 hours of gameplay I have completed 25 endings of 26.Yes there are multiple endings, most of which are funny jokes ofc, but still: you haven't played the game unless you've seen A,B,C,D endings, those are core story parts you have to see.When finishing the story first time it looked like the plot is weak and open world is too small.When doing the second walkthrough new game mechanics are introduced and new characters rise this game to new level.When continuing with third route it feels like that two previous were just a tutorial frankly!And at the time you reach final credits (you'll know it's finals I promise ;D)... oh let's say we all cry sometimes, okay?+ Game's music is one of the best I've heard so far.+ Plot feels like classic anime story at some points (watch your jaw when starting route C)+ Optimization is okay for my [phenom II x4 + 7870] potato, could have 40+ fps most of the time+ Awesome rpg-like chip system+ Bullet hell is on point, cool mix of genres+ Combat system is a step up comparing to MGR:R (previous Platinum's game)- Ballance feels a bit off sometimes, I wish enemies were always constant % stronger/weaker depending on difficulty.- Graphics is okay, for a console port but still it's 2017- You wouldn't like playing without a gamepad.It's definitely a GOTY for me. P.S.: I would also nominate it for the best ending credits, might be even better then portal's, hehe :D			"

I completed the game on PS4.Pros : - Yoko Taro knows how to masterfully direct a game and how to write a thougth-provoking and complex story complemented with compelling and deep characters.- Just like the first NieR, Automata plays a lot with camera perspectives and mixes gameplay elements from multiple video game genres.- Another absolutely stellar soundtrack from Keiichi Okabe (Slight spoilers ahead) : [1] [2] [3]- Emi Evans' voice is back.- Beautiful world aesthetic and character designs.- There's quite a few winks to the original NieR, especially in the latter parts of the game.- The overall writing quality of the sidequests makes them a joy to get through, despite some sidequest objectives being fairly uninspired.- The english dub is of very good quality, while of course not being as good as the one from the original NieR. (Japanese cast is also very good but that's kind of a given.)- 50+ hours of content.- The game is full of small details that'll put a smile on your face. Automata truly feels like a passion project for the whole development team. (UNPOLISHED)- You don't need to collect all the weapons to get endings C, D & E.- More text-adventure sections.Cons (most of them are just me nitpicking) :- The gameplay style of one of the three main protagonist gets pretty annoying after 10+ hours.- If you start the hacking mini-game during a dialogue, the dialogue will keep going while you're stuck in the mini-game ; you'll then be unable to hear what's going on.- Fairly simple combat-system when compared to other works from Platinum.- I don't think the last 5~ minutes from ending A & B are particularly well directed.- Random fps drops while exploring. (Mostly happens in the City Ruins.)- From a graphical standpoint, Automata is nothing to write home about.Final thoughts : Please give your money to Yoko Taro so he can keep buying booze so he can keep making weird games like only he can.

												Is NieR:Automata gonna make me cry before it's even out? I'm crying, someone hold me..This game is the most special game i've ever played, ironically recommended by a trustworthy lady. Even with its many graphic poor choices or fails it transcends that level tenfold if you seek more than that in a game. Honestly, if you play this, play for story and music. The story has some pretty interesting twists in it and the music is gorgeous. It has this nostalgic and palpable spirit healing soul that everyone should experience and learn from. I recommend it to anyone that can relate with this songs and feels like good ol' rpg's are dead.			"

												Yes this game has crashes.Yes this game APPEARS to have resolution issues.Yes the game is pretty poorly optimized.All that aside, this game is probably one of the most worth it experiences I have played in a long time. If you can look past the issues this port has, and they can be significant, this game will not only be entertaining in its gameplay, but keep you guessing on the story as well. Be forwarned, you may have to invest a hefty amount of time into the game to get a large amount of the story. Multiple endings and somewhat large changes in perspective across playthroughs will keep this game a more fresh experience than you may expect. My time played currently is a playthrough of the A ending and I have started my second. With the combination of Yoko Taro's writing and Platinum's game play, this is a ""nier"" must buy. I do hope the port issues are fixed sooner rather than later, though.			"

Nier: Automata is treasure to be enjoyed by all who love games, whose beauty is far more than skin-deep.Rare are the moments when I am compelled to take time out to leave a review for a game. In fact, I think I've written only one or two reviews in the 8 or 9 years I've been on Steam. And yet, NieR: Automata has compelled me to leave one. I'll try to keep it brief, but I will probably fail: From beginning to end and from top to bottom, this game is exquisite. The pacing, the feel of its open world, the music, the twisting and turning story are all among the very best in the class. Told over multiple play throughs from multiple perspectives, and leaning heavily on nihilistic precepts and philosphies, the game takes you on a roller coaster of a ride that not only forces you to question the motives of the protagonists and antoganists, but their very purpose (and yours too from time to time). Side quests aren't your typical filler experiences found in most open world experiences: each one was carefully crafted to add depth and complexity to the story, to the background, to the core philosophical questions the game poses to the player and its characters. A game of depth, weight, pleasure and pain that slaps you in the face over and over again.The game is very emotional. The high quality story telling through the game's interactions brings you in tight with the characters (even the side characters) and doesn't let go. The hardships some characters endure over the course of the game is presented without lots of direct exposition, rather through subtle body language, discouraged commentaries, and painful admissions. Fleeting hope makes you want to grab at it like a lifeline as pain and sadness reaches out to envelope you and your protagonists. The struggle of emotions bears the most satisfying of rewards for those players who endure to the end. The distance some characters have...their reactions to situations...it's all for a deeper reason, all of which will be revealed with time. And it's worth the wait to find out. Nihlism runs deep in the game as I mentioned and several characteers are named after famous philospophers. Reading about them will enrich your overall experience.So who is NieR: Automata for anyway, Dreams?In my opinion, it's for every gamer who loved the story and delivery of games like FF7 and FFX but have been perpetually disappointed with the RPG genre ever since. It's for those who love beautiful characters with exquisite animation. It's for those who love great action and awesome combat. It's for those who love a game with meaning that go far deeper than the surface and forces you in the real world to question your motivations and values. Should you have an ear to hear what characters and situations are really saying, this game will resonate with you like a clanging symbol long after your play session ends. It's for those who enjoy the idea or experience of playing a game multiple times from multiple perspectives (think Dishonored), each more rewarding than the last. Hell, the game doesn't even begin until the 3rd playthrough, and by then you will have had enough ""holy s**t!"" moments to last the rest of the year. Level with me, Dreams: Should I pick this one up?YEP. I went in with ZERO expectations (didn't play any Drakengard games or the original Nier)...and came out the other side championing this game as my Game of The Year already. Sorry, Zelda. Sorry Nioh. Sorry Horizon. Sorry _____ (fill in whatever else is coming this year). If I didn't have another single player game to play this year, this would be enough for me. The mix of highs and lows, the pacing, the character development, the emotions on display from beginning to end have wrapped me around this game's proverbial finger. So much so that after 90 hours, I'm genuinely *excited* to start all over again from scratch. No game I've ever played has so moved me, and with the depth of the characters and knowing the story behind the story, I expect the next time through might be even better. This is a game that was clearly made with more love than most. It takes more risks than most and as a result offers a product rarely seen. If you enjoy single player, story-driven games at all, you do yourself a disservice by NOT playing this game. There's a reason it's Metacritic score is so high and why so many people are talking about this game. Ok okay, but...would you buy it again, Dreams? At Day One prices?Look at me in my eyes. I'd buy this game again in a heartbeat, folks. I've never been more glad than I am now that I took a chance on a game (never played any of the games in the franchise before). I haven't felt this rewarded by a game experience in 20 years (Final Fantasy 7 at launch) and I mean that. The game is probably going to end up in my top 5 all time, and I've been gaming for 30 years. Do yourself a favor and pick this game up. Do it today. Support this team and Yoko Taro's work. He is one of the best story tellers we have left. Oh, and do yourself a favor and immediately disable MSAA.

												The only complaint I have is the port quality is mediocre. Not bad, just ugly. Choppy cutscenes, weird resolution bugs, all that jazz. Fortunately, there's a fix floating around, and the game is amazing enough to make up for it, so to pass on this game would be a huge shame.			"

												Windows 64bit, i7 3820 cpu oc @ 4.2ghz 16GB RAM nvidia gtx 660 ti GPU (below min specs on gpu)High Settings: 1920x1080 12-14 fps, slow motion, pretty unplayable [vram over 2gig]High Settings: 1600x900 37 fps, playable.Low Settings: 1920x1080 40-45ish fps, playable, visual quality noticeably worse though.High Settings: 1280x720 40-60 fps, very nice. I'll be sticking to this.Random things I noticed:Windows mouse pointer stays on screen have to move to side=badBlack bars at sides of screen=bad,Button prompts change between kbd and controller depending what you last touched=good.Man, you can get really far in this without the ability to save. I just played for an hour, died,  back to the start. edit: twice.A thing I find pretty dodgy is that a news item on the steam store page for 3 March says that the Valve Character Accessory is ""pre-order exclusive"" and now it's ""steam exclusive"" so there was no point pre-ordering with all the risks due to no review copies.

												OH BOY.This game is fantastic. The story is unique and crazy with lore everywhere. Even your weapons tell a story. You will need multiple runs to fully understand the main Plot. Side Quests are really simple but reward you with a bit of cash and needed materials. The Combat is amazing, smooth and fun. Tho i recommend playing on harder dificulties. And the Soundtrack. Boy is it good. If im not playing im using it to study. Its just so good.9/10 for weak Port. Running it on a 1070, i5 4460 (slightly below recommended) and there are some framedrops plus the awkwardly slow render time. "

												Breaking character just for this review and this review alone. All my other reviews are jokes. How do you make a funny joke about something you genuinely love? I'm a very detrimentally masculine person, and this wrangled tears out of me not one but FIVE times. Everything that this game had shown in media is bait. 2b's huge butt and sultry thighs? Bait. PLATINUM game's fantastic combat? Bait. The 6 hours of one of the most dynamic and well composed music ever put into a video game (excluding DOOM 2016 for completely different reasons)? BAIT. Everything this game shows off lures you in for what will really draw you in: emotional connection to EVERY character with more than five seconds of screen time. It helps that the gameplay in-between REEKS of polish. This game will require multiple playthroughs, but trust me when I say none are truly doing the same thing again, and that you should absolutely sit down and experience every single (main) ending this game has to offer. You will feel burnt out and think, ""is it really worth it to play through this game two more times when I could probably look up the endings on YouTube or a wiki site?"" And the answer is yes. Yes Yes yes. As soon as you start the second you will understand and by the end of your second you will be HOOKED. If you are also a fan of the drakengard series or the original Nier, this is a MUST BUY at any price. If you are new to the series, do not be afraid for this to be your jumping in point. Only concerns I have are with some performance for a select few players but at the time of writing this(4/3/17) the devs have said it was being addressed.  This game is best played with a controller, but keyboard is VERY usable. (Again, I know this review isn't funny, but I'm not ♥♥♥♥ing talented enough to turn a from the heart recommendation into a joke.)Tl;dr came for the butt, stayed for the immense emotional attachment (much like someone I know, you know who you are) Glory to Mankind.

												An absolutely beautiful experience.One of the best games I've played in a while and I'm so happy that I have un-earthed this gem. The fighting mechanics are easy to use and executed fluidly for intense battles with difficulty levels that range for all players. The game has multiple weapons  that range from swords, katanas, power gauntlets, spears etc which can be upgraded at your leisure. Not to mention the range of passive skills that change your character dramatically on your play style along with temporary buffs.The music soundtracks are breath taking with each one just as epic as the last, giving you the feel for the settings and characters which will touch your heart as you play. it's truly a remarkable experience on the feels coaster!The enemies are tough and rewarding to kill, some stronger than others of course and ranging from multiple sizes, each with their own fighting abilities with awesome boss fights which are challenging and fun to play. Throughout the game you will talk to various characters and their background history, personality are all portrayed by great voice acting and plot. You'll truly feel the feelings that character is feeling along with their motives.(There is a total of 26 endings!!!) so the replayability is endless and you will try to get as many possible. Each play through feels like a brand new experience which gives the feeling of playing the first time again. Besides the main quests there are loads of side quests and secret areas to keep you entertained. I know some people love to explore and find there own adventure which is something this game encourages highly as you can get alot of cool items and abilities from the side quests and the hidden areas. As you progress through the story more and more side quests will be unlocked, you'll never run out of things to do.Considering my medium rig (with a pretty low end processor) I only get a few FPS drops which mainly stays around the 50-60 area for me so the game is pretty well optimized in my opinion. Only problem at the moment is the resolution, even in 1920x1080p it's not quite 1080p, it's been drastically upscaled. There are some work arounds like having it in windowed mode and so on, but hopefully this is fixed in the next patch. If you are struggling to get 60fps alot of the problems are around the ""anti-aliasing""option, try turning this down or off and enabling ""Vsync"". I know on alot of games ""Vsync"" makes the game lag and in somecases un-playable, but this game does it right.I highly recommend this game.			"

												I don't often write serious reviews for games because I'm too lazy and I think it's much more fun to just make jokes so here we go-I honestly made the mistake of thinking that Nier was Devil May Cry + waifubait main character. For that reason, I didn't want to buy it at all. But then my friends started playing it, and started beating it. Beating it multiple times. They told me it made them emotional, even cry in a couple parts. So I set aside money from my paycheck to buy it and I'm actually so glad I did. Even though it's only (the last day of) March, I feel pretty comfortable saying that Nier will be my GOTY. It's one of the best single player experiences I've ever had, while definitely not trading gameplay for story. Typically I expect either a compelling story or some super fun gameplay, but this game has both in spades. I've spent a lot of time just messing around with my stats and plug in chips, finding the perfect match to fit my playstyle. Another thing I was hung up about: Typically games like this require a controller, but I'm perfectly fine just playing on keyboard and mouse- it's actually perfect in my opinion. I don't feel like I'm slighted by not having a controller at all, but I would believe it if someone told me it was easier with a controller. Games like this are made for controllers I believe, but in Nier the keyboard and mouse controls don't suffer at all. So, yeah- I was initially planning on avoiding this game altogether, waiting for the hype to die down so I didn't have to see this ""flavour of the month"" game anymore. But I was very ignorant and so, so wrong about that, I'm glad I gave this game a chance and I recommend that anyone who's on the fence about this game just hurry up and buy it already. You won't regret it.10/10.			"

												With basically 40 hours of game time, 25/26 endings compleated (one joke ending remaining), and a majority of the weapons maxed, I can say that I've gotten a firm grasp on the game as a whole.I am amazed with this game. From top to bottom it is nearly a perfect experience, and even with it's flaws it is worth the ride. Really anyone going into this game should be as blind as possible, excluding knowing the previous game Nier. Just really take my word for it and if you're interested I believe you should try the game. The only reason I say that you should play Nier is that knowing Nier will give more context to the events that happen in the game. It's entirely possible to not know Nier and still get the gist of what happened due to ingame text, but if you do't want to play the original watch Clemps' series on Nier, which you can check out the first part here - 


YouTube™ Video: NieR Analysis - Clemps (PART 1)

			https://twitter.com/MrClemps https://www.twitch.tv/clempstwitch Clemps decides to break out the Nier analysis / review just before the festive period is over and before Nier Automata comes out on the...		

But getting back to the game, really take my word on it and go in, it's one of the games of the year hands down. No matter what comes out.Now for the meat of the review for those not interested yet, and I'll try to keep it spoiler free as possible. Taking place long in the future, robots have taken over planet earth, you and your android buddies are tasked to make the earth habitable by destroying all machine lifeforms roaming the planet. Dispite this simple premise things will quickly show just how dire the situation is for your goal. The 5 ""branches"" of the story will take you to places you didn't think a game could go, and even at times uncomfortable. The director doesn't simply want you to look at these issues skin-deep, unlike other narritive games, this game gets it's hands dirty and will show you the uncomfortable truths to what they're fighting for. I'm trying really hard to keep it spoiler free so take my word on it, that if you can finish all 5 endings you will be in for a ride.For combat I believe the game stands strong with other spectacle fighters out there. With a simple attack system of two buttons (light and heavy), and a fire button. You will be hacking and slashing in no time with no issues. Combat is extremely fluid and feels natural at all times even with odd weapon combos. Not to mention you can equipt a primary and secondary weapon to outfit your character, each class of weapon will outfit your character with new movesets you an mess around with. And you can level up your weapons further augmenting their behavior. As you progress your character will level up as well as improve as you find chips that give you passive and active abilities. These chips can be combined and arraged in your character's system memory (they are an android), and using the space wisely will grealy change your playstyle. With limited space and with greater buffs needing more space you will quickly make your character strong in a few segments, you can even remove parts of your hud for more space to upgrade your character.Now really I have huge prasies for the game as a whole, with story being the greatest. For cons the world takes place in a small by today's standards of open world. But as you traverse the world you'll understand the parts of it, as well as notice changes that happen as the game progresses. So there is a minor pro to it, but if you constantly need new fresh enviroment this game will test some of that during the second branch, which reuses much of the content of the first, alibt tweaked as well as including more content and sidequests. But you get to keep your upgrades and weapons between playthroughs, as well as finished side quests. So you will plow through content faster causing these downtime parts to not be as impactful. But expect to retread old content for at least 3-4 hours of your experience. Which is definately a hinderance and can be the make or break point for some players. But if you can make it through you'll definately be rewarded for it. The later content is going to be remembered for a long time to come.I hope I gave a good rundown on the game as a whole, and if you enjoyed this review or have comments feel free to leave feedback. I really hope I didn't spoil anything as well as gave a compelling reason to try out the game. Now to get back and get that last joke ending...			"

												NieR: Automata or in Original  ニーアオートマタ (Nia Otomata) is an fantastic RPG / Action game. For the ones who hasn't follow the ""NieR"" Games , don't you worry , this game is totally offbased from the Original which means that the game ( Automata ) has an complete diffrent story than the ""Pre-Quels"".Pros : -As said it has an very good Soundtrack -Great Character Development  of 2B, 9S and A2 -Multiple Endings ( i'm not gonna go further in that , cause maybe i will spoil you ;/-And an awesome Battle System ( Easy to learn buuut a bit tricky to Master ;)-huge varieties of places you can visit Cons:-Fullscreen Resolution is bugging-And there is an FPS Lock But in the end , I'll recommend this game with all my Heart 10/10 Cypher approved ;)  "

The game contains several endings and after you beat it the character 9S is playable.♥ LOVED IT ♥ If you are into sci-fi it is worth the ride!			"

I decided to play more than just 1 hour to actually get a sense of what the game is like, and not just throw a random review out there. (Spoiler free) EDIT: Proposal: Purchase immediately.So, with that out of the way, please note that I've NEVER player any of the previous games, this is purely my opinion about THIS one.GraphicLet's start with the most obvious one here. For me the game looks great. The artstyle, the characters, the city, everything. Some of the underground scenes aren't as appealing however, mostly the dark areas, but that doesn't take anything away from the game. I'm running the game with a GTX 970 strix, an Intel Celeron G1840, as well as 16 GB of RAM, and I honestly had no FPS issues ever. The game did crash twice under 16 hours of playtime but it was mostly down to my slow CPU. So, personally, I had no issues with FPS what so ever, although fullscreen doesn't work what so ever. (Borderless window fixed that... sorta)Controls, GameplayThis is a tricky one. First it was really hard for me to get used to the controls, to a point where I kept switching between controller and keyboard and I still didn't feel exactly good with either, but by now I settled with the controller (steam) because it's the most natural one for this type of game. The game itself feels fluid and smooth, the combat is hard but never unfair. My one and only complain is the fact that you can't switch between your targets easily once you lock onto one. Though that might be just me playing too much Dark Souls.. The open world is nice but to be honest, it feels a bit limited from time to time. Sometimes a clearly open way will have invisible walls around it, forcing you to either avoid that area or go around it, but overall it is a really beautiful world in it's own right. The few online elements are a nice touch as well, seeing where other players died before you makes the game feel a bit like Dark Souls. Where you know you're not alone, others are struggling with the same part you're playing at. Being able to repair some of those androids to help you can sometimes turn the tides in a battle.StoryTo get a deeper understanding, you should ask someone else. If you're just looking for an opinion from a casual gamer, it's great. I, of course, haven't finished it, but it seems very interesting. The soundtrack for me is a mix. Some of it I really like, some of it.. not that much. But that's just a personal opinion, I'm sure most people love every soundtrack the game has to offer, because it is great, just not my taste. Overall, I didn't regret pre-ordering, go ahead and get the game for yourself. It was time for a game like this to give me some hope after some obvious failures... I'm looking at you, No Man's Sky...

												I love, love this game!The combat is fun, the soundtrack is phenomenal, the story has me hooked. I have a feeling that my mind is being screwed with ever so subtely. Some of these machines are displaying human like actions and emotions, which has my imagination running wild with the possibilities.Did I mention the soundtrack is phenomenal?So let's talk difficulty. I took a risk on this game knowing that it contained an unholy trinity of three genres that I'm horrible at: shmups, twin stick shooters, and platformers. I was worried that I was going to find this game too difficult and end up quitting out of frustration. Five hours later, I'm pleasantly surprised with how much I'm enjoying the game. On normal difficulty, it's been very accessible to someone like me. I do still run into random balls, my pod still shoots in the opposite direction, and I attack when I should be evading, however the game hasn't been punishing for it.In regards to the introduction, I went with Easy difficulty with the auto options enabled. The reason for this was because I had read about people getting frustrated over having to replay the intro because there's no option to save until after it's completed. It was kind of amazing because during combat the game played itself. Once the intro was over, I was able to adjust the difficulty to Normal and really start playing the game on my own. There's still no auto save, but there's plenty of locations within the game to quick save. In fact, once discovered, you only have to be in range of the access point to quick save.Now if only I could enable an auto-attack for my pod in Normal mode, it would be perfect.I <3 2B			"

												Thats like Final Fantasy 13 all over again. The game itself is really great, but hence everybody complains about bad console port habits and is giving the game a bad review.Gameplay-wise this game has everything, from hack'n'slay to 2D-scroller and top view combat action. It's really fun to slay enemies with so many options to do so. The graphics are fine, good tho to fit the tone and atmosphere of the game.The story seems pretty interesting so far and the characters do have some personality, even as androids.It runs really smooth and shouldnt be considered a bad port. SE or Platinum will eventually deliver some updates to improve your experience performance wise.Everybody who likes JRPGs or is a hack n slay fan should give it a try.			"

												Yoko Taro, the creator and machinehead behind this game, is a genius. This is not your average hack n slash but more like a work of art you can't stop thinking about. Firstly, i do not care about minor release bugs bound to be patched very soon. Secondly, there's more to a game than white underwear and ladders. I like this game because of the following things:- details. Character garments get dusty, wet, dry, torn in suicide. Sounds, environment and light all have their own details. - longivity. When you get exited about the game you may think about it, want to play it again, enjoy playing it again. - diversity. compared to mainstream games it's finally a ""normal"" length game for an oldschooler. No waste of money and options like network, upgrades and weapons give you choices to do a completely different approach to second, third, fourth playthrough.- story. imaginative, humorous and innovative. quests in an open world are interesting, tempting and surprising. for androids emotions are prohibited. what a dilemma in such an emotional world. and the machines you fight seem so full of life it's ironic. I don't like this game because:- i don't have as much spare time as i would want to have so i could play this wonderful game. 9½ / 10(not a full 10 because out o fmy scifi alien horror franchise, sorry Yoko.

Yoko Taro's genius dramaturgy combined with Keiichi Okabe's breathtaking musical score and neatly wrapped in Platinum Games' trademark hurricane action brings about an absolutely stunning gameplay experience.Do yourself a favour, don't read or watch anything that could spoil the game's plot, go in blind and experience everything first-hand.NieR: Automata is an absolute must have, and a strong contender on a role of game of the year for me.

												There are many games that can tell a great story. There are only a few in which that story can only be told as a video game. Nier: Automata is one of those games. Most of the Nier: Automata is a character action game with some added RPG elements. Think of the action like a lighter version of Bayonetta. You are able to level up, upgrade weapons, and add and change out upgrades to your character. However, that isn’t the full extent of what Nier: Automata is. The game begins as a top down shooter, changes to a twin-stick shooter, then to an Afterburner-style shooter, and then finally to a side-scrolling shooter. Yes, this is actually an Action RPG. Controlling your character is smooth and responsive, as you would expect from PlatinumGames. The open world is not one giant open playspace. The main area has several paths that branch out and lead to new areas. Think of it more like a Souls game rather than a Skyrim or Witcher 3. One of the strongest aspects of Nier: Automata is its soundtrack. Most of the songs have vocals that fade in and out as the situation dictates. I found the musical direction and situational use of certain tracks to evoke an emotion to be some of the strongest I’ve ever seen in a game.  Here   are   some   examples  of my favorite tracks.Playing with different genres is one way Nier: Automata changes and subverts expectations. The other way is how its story is presented. I won’t get into detail of how these moments subvert gaming and game stories, as it is a spoiler, but the game does things that very, very few games have done before. Nier: Automata has five main endings, and a handful of other more lighthearted ones. These aren’t “endings” in the traditional sense, but rather more like chapters to the story. You have not actually beaten Nier: Automata until you’ve gotten all five main endings, and I’d strongly suggest that if you are going to play this game, that you do not stop after a single ending.

												10 hours went by without me noticing.Edit:Didn't realize my rating would get traction. I bought NieR without much research, but it is a very solid game. (Will update once completing the game)Combat: A+The combat is probably my favorite. In Guild Wars 2 or WoW, when you hit something it feels fluid and smooth. While in NieR, hitting a monster feels solid and crisp. Hard to explain but I would compare this feeling to the combat from Tera. In addition, the combination of different attacks pairing different weapons is great. (Similar to GW2) Story: ? (Haven't finished the game yet, so I will update this)I played 10 hours and to my pleasant surprise that isn't even close to the end. Apparently I only finished route A? Waiting to finish final exams until I continue the rest. Music: AYou're immersed and the music is pleasant. Voice Acting: A- One of the better English dubs. Environment: B+So far, it was either broken buildings, a forest, a desert, an amusement park, or the sea. Haven't finished the game, so I will update if there is more. Felt like the world could be a little more diverse. Despite being in a different section, most areas produced a similar vibe. Monsters/Bosses: B+Wouldn't say there is a tremendous variety in monsters. However, the boss designs are nice and unique.			"

												It's everything it was expected to be, and so much more. Some mad genius gave Yoko Taro a budget and Platinum Games and they created one for the ages. This is an experience best entered as blind as possible, as the surprises and new contexts given to your actions as a player break your heart, throw some salt on it, and shove it down your throat lovingly. Ending A is about 1/4 of the way through for those unfamiliar with Yoko Taro's multiple endings schtick.The port is servicable if not good, use borderless gaming for fullscreen above 720p, as there is some weird upscaling otherwise.Also makes you a king of geometry wars.God-Tier OST that is dynamically affected by the playerBleak but beautiful world that is just the right sizeNuanced and literally earthshattering plotGoofs and chuckles, tears and depressionWhy on Earth did I say yes after E?

With boss fights that will leave you wanting more. Although the second route might look like a re:run. I tell it's not and when you began the third play through. It will open your eyes, and take you for a ride.This game will have you question the plot, and wondering. It's a good thing that most games get wrong.

												NieR:Automata is one of the best games I got to experience. This is one of the few games that has a story with a powerful meaning, a story I won't forget. Each playthrough reveals more to the vague plot and shows more about the protagonists. The game was able to make me care about the characters which really made the story. I never experienced an ending to a story like this, it's something that can only be experienced for oneself as I can't explain it. Who knew dodging and shooting balls during the credit scene could be emotional. Pros:- A story that will never be forgotten.- Combat never gets old. A good player is able to do amazing things (perfect dodges, counter attacking, pod skills, using weapon sets to the fullest) all in perfect motion.- The soundtrack is amazing, it really sets the mood during the game.- Likeable characters, I cared about what would happen to them. - Plug-in chips allow for various playstyles.- Each weapon has its own story that can tell a lot.- Small details to fully understand the story and meaning.- I was able to play on max with 50-60 fps with an i5-4690 and gtx 1060, never crashed.Cons:- Graphics aren't the best for today's standards. It really wasn't the selling point to begin with, but some people do care about it.- At one point of the game, the map had to load in every now and then.- Left me thinking about life.NieR:Automata is one of those special games that comes out once in awhile. The story itself was worth it and everything else just makes it all that better. Get this game if possible, it should be experienced not watched.10/10 hit me with the feels.			"

 Be aware that I've never played the first NieR nor any Drakengard Games. I went into this fully Blind and just discovered about half an Hour of Playtime, so be aware, that this Review is NOT here to look at the Story Points. Pros:+ It's from Platinum Games and if you always wanted a Bayonetta Game, there you go+ Story+ Soundtrack+ Full of different enviroments+ It's Action, Beat'em up, 2d, 3d in One. It trys to do everything throughout the whole Game+ 60fps (90% of the Time)Cons:- The optimization... Sometimes i get FPS Drops to 40 even tho I quite have a good PC [Specs mentioned at the bottom]- 30 FPS lock at Cutscenes? Atleast for me- There is 4k but its horrible optimized- Fullscreen is not... Fullscreen? It looks and feels weird. It looks more like 1024x768 o.OSpecs:

i7 4770k @ 3.50ghz
GTX 1070 EVGA SC @ 8gb vram
16gb ddr3 RAM


If you can look over those Cons it's quite a fun Game, but i would actually wait for a Day one Patch.

												This game is all about:2B pencil, 9S pen, and A2 paper.One real (E)nding and bunch of happy ones that precede it. Happy ending with a twist at the end that requires you to do something physical on your drive. backup your save files Nothing extraordinary imo but the way it was done was very nice. The combat is fluid that is complemented by amazing music. If you like a bit out of the ordinary story with twists and lots of ending, a nice android butt, or good action oriented gameplay, this is the game for you.No seriously, it's a very solid game. One of the best in the list of games of 2017 no doubt. I am also giving 2B's butt BOTY (Butt of The Year Award ) of 2017.			"

												Don't buy the game until it's patched.  A lot of people, including myself, are experiencing an issue where the screen just turns white at certain intervals.  The game also doesn't auto-save and you can't save in the hour long prologue.  I tried running through it five times, and got a white screen every time.

												Roughly 50 hours and 3 boxes of kleenex later, I still find myself fascinated with the world of Nier: Automata. Platinum Games manages to deliver gameplay worthy of Yoko Taro's superb writing abilities; something that Cavia and Access Games fell short on for much of the Drakenguard series and previous Nier title. This is the best PG and Yoko Taro game I've ever played, and hopefully, we will see them more from them in the future.Scroll to the bottom for tl;drPresentationGraphicsFrom a purely technical standpoint, Nier: Automata's visuals are not particularly impressive. If I didn't know anything and you told me this game came out in 2013, I'd probably believe you. However, the overall art direction, stylized HUD and menu design and choice of color palette come together well to portrait a desolate world that's eerily beautiful from start to finish. Character (butt) design and movement animations are generally excellent as expected; packed with style and fluidity faithful to the PG name.SoundsThe soundtrack is fantastic. Each track is beautifully orchestrated and fit perfectly with the game. The first time you enter a new environment or boss fight, you will be completely drawn into the moment by the music that comes on. Sound effects and voice acting are serviceable but nothing to write home about. PlotI don't usually talk about the story too much but the story is head and shoulders above any of PG's previous efforts. It's still a little bit rough around the edges in the actual delivery with things such as pacing and over-dramatizing certain moments while underplaying others but overall, this is one of the best stories in a video game in recent years. The script is filled with surprises yet constantly building upon a powerful theme about existentialism and purpose. For a game about androids and machines, it deals with these ""human"" issues with mature and often, cruel realism. All of this leading into a memorable and heart-wrenching conclusion. Equally interesting is the way the story is told. This game is designed to be played multiple times. Your first playthrough will leave you with a sense of disconnect between the characters and the world, a feeling of being rushed to the end and ultimately, more questions than answers. Without spoiling anything, your next playthroughs will be very different as more and more pieces of the story are revealed to you and by the end of the 25-30 hours it takes to reach the true ending, you'll come to genuinely care for the main characters. Characters and DialogueThe main cast along with a few supporting characters are interesting and present a variety of different personalities. While the main story is adequately long and provides just enough moments to make these personalities and their relationships believable, outside of that, character interactions are very limited. Of course, this is not uncommon in games with larger supporting casts but I couldn't help but feel the relationships between the main characters could've been more developed with some additional dialogue. It's also worth noting that unlike previous PG titles which were scripted with Western audiences in mind, this is a very Japanese game. The translations do a decent job of conveying the general meaning of the dialogue as well as the story but unless you have some understanding of Japanese culture if not the language itself, you might not be able to understand the significance of some of the more casual conversations between characters. GameplayExplorationAlthough this is advertised as an open world game, this feels the most underdeveloped. For the most part, you can go wherever you want, whenever you want but there isn't much purpose to it. In fact, the map and quest design actually discourages exploration. While there are a few hidden areas and treasures scattered across the world, it's almost always the case that you can only access these locations through a single designated route. Too often you'll find a wall or doorway that you can clearly fit through yet there is an invisible wall placed to prevent you from doing so. Furthermore, most of these areas you will end up visiting during one of the main/side quests anyways so there isn't much incentive to running off on your own. I get that open world games are all the rave these days and I appreciate some of the things PG tries to do here but it's not nearly enough to call this an open world title.CombatCombat is usually the biggest reason to play any PG title and although it takes a backseat to the story this time around, it still manages to be fun and engaging. Fans who are expecting a typical PG hack and slash combat system might be slightly disappointed though. This is very simple combat system compared to PG's previous works and games like DmC. There is no advanced combo system and no special move triggers. Everything looks and feels great but it's not particularly deep or rewarding. Instead, the game maintains variety by cycling through different game genres. Nier: Automata is a combination of 3rd person action, 2D platformer and top-down bullet hell and for the most part, they transition into one another quite well while making sure the latter two don't overstay their welcome. QuestingMain quests are mostly there to push the story and give you an excuse to cut stuff up. The objectives themselves are nothing special, but they're kept interesting through the variety of enemies and environments you encounter. Most of the side quests in this game are designed to reinforce the overarching theme of the story. In addition to the usual rewards, they offer small bits of dialogue and information which all up to contribute to the world in a meaningful way. It is recommendable to do some of them while completing the main quests, just don't expect fully fleshed out side-stories out of something like the Witcher 3. Customization and ProgressionA mixed bag. On one hand, the chip system is very well designed and even manages to tie into the lore. Rather than just picking certain skills and maxing them out like in a traditional RPG, the chip system has varying usage costs between high and low level versions of the same skill. Forcing the player to pick between having a few high-level chips, multiple low-level chips or a combination of both. Weapon upgrades on the other hand, feel insignificant. There are 4 weapon types and quite a few weapons of each to collect but other than their physical appearance, the only noticeable difference between most weapons is a passive effect or subtle change in cosmetics and you'll most likely just end up using the ones you think look the best.ConclusionWhile Nier: Automata is far from perfect, it does something that very few games do well, especially in this genre and that's deliver a memorable, complete experience that leaves the player with more to think about than when they started. I never thought I'd mention the words story and Platinum Games in the same sentence but this is truly a title which exemplifies why video games should be respected as an art form of story-telling. Thanks for reading!Tl;drPros:- Amazing, thought-provoking story- Beautiful overall presentation with stylish and unique characters and environments befitting the setting- Incredible soundtrack- Varied, multi-genre gameplay- Interesting skill system- 2B's buttCons:- Limited character interactions- Underdeveloped open world- Underwhelming item progression- Some technical and optimization issues			"

Looks good and supports 2560 x1440 resolution on my monitor @60fps, and 60 is fine.Do yourself a favor and if you can afford it pick it up it's a real gem.			"

												This game is certainly one of them, Art types. Also, you can absolutely see it's a product of passion. It was made to convey a message and make people feel ""the feels"", not to rake in some cash. After seeing all of the 5 main endings (you have to subsequently unlock all of them to see the true finale to the whole story, they are not just 5 independent, alternative endings) i can say for sure that this is one of the most memorable stories i've experienced.Pros:- Rich and unorthodox story, with existentialism, absurdism and nihilism being the main themes which are explored A LOT.- Outstanding design. Levels, characters, UI, animations, weapons, etc - everything looks polished and smooth, like it's a finished and refined product which can't be improved any further (a rare occurrence these days).- Great music.- No babysitting bs. You don't waste time on stupid handholding tutorials and introductions.- Prohibitive death penalties and no save/load abuse (very similar to Souls games).- Cool little feature with occasional camera mechanics switches - sometimes it switches to top-down zoom-out, or side view.- Multiple cute little details and features that you just wouldn't find in ""conventional"" AAA games.Cons:- Not enough difficulty levels - normal is too easy, hard is too hard, there should be 1 more option that would be average between normal and hard.- Technically it's not impressive, just mediocre.- Game would be better off without many of the side quests. Like, half of them are boring and don't expand any of the game's lore at the same time. Side quests should either be fun, or tell you something interesting (or do both, ideally).- No multiplayer and longevity. It could, potentially, have something similar to Souls' multiplayer, to give people a good reason to really dive into character building/optimization and verse the most challenging enemies - another players. But there's none, so as soon as you get 100% completion the game's over.- Instead of making a thousand joke bad endings just to match every letter of English alphabet they should've made just a few proper bad endings with a bit of cinematics and story.Overall, it's a solid 10/10 for me.

												This was my first Yoko Taro game.Initially, the the first hour of my experience was rather bland.  I almost quit the game one hour in. I'm glad I didn't,  because before I knew it I was locked into Yoko Taro's wild ride with no breaks. The game has a great soundtrack accompanied an excellent story. The story explores machine consciousness, and the purpose of life, in a word fallen into entropy.  World building is done well, and make you feel invested into the lore of the game. The combat system is fluid, and let's you pull of some pretty crazy combos if you can master them (https://youtu.be/KoNE1eMP8rU). Regardless, it is still possible to complete the game on normal difficaulty by mostly button mashing your attacks.Issues: 	-The game downscales resolution for many people when going full screen mode. (dev's are working on a fix, according to a post earlier this week).	- 9S hacking minigames are way too regular and become dull fast.This game has become one of my favorites. Would recommend to anyone with time to spare.			"

												Let's be clear here, I haven't beat this game yet and I am in no hurry to. This is one of those games you load up and it feels like slipping on your favorite pair of shoes, once broken in to the controls and world/lore you just feel extremely comfortable in this game world. I pre ordered this because I wanted something different and perhaps even 'bold' in its design/story/themes and that is exactly what I got in this game. Almost as if this game was designed in its own microcosm where the devs played nothing but Contra(nes), Dark Souls, Gradius and Bayonetta then read Conrad's Heart of Darkness to go to sleep at night after a long day of game design. Is it perfect? No, it has issues at launch and a few workarounds are needed to get above 1080 and borderless window (download borderless gaming 8.4 asap) and the 60fps lock is unfortunate (the 30fps cutscenes downright criminal). None of this is a deal breaker for me but you may want to buy this direct through steam in case you have any issues yourself you can refund easily.      If you find yourself interested in this game and you are doing research, watching reviews, streams etc etc do yourself a favor and stop right away and just get the game. Experience this one as fresh and wide-eyed as possible for the most enjoyable time with Nier, otherwise you may lessen the impact and believe me this game will leave an impression on you. Lastly, I just want to say that Nier:Automata has one of the greatest soundtracks ever put in a video game of any kind. Remember that feeling you get from the Diablo 1 guitar theme or all those times you sang Baba-Yetu in the shower (ok maybe that last one was just me) but yea, It's like that. Thanks for reading and I will likely update or rewrite this review upon proper completion.			"

												I've been hyped for this game for a long time but I didn't want to get my hopes up TOO high when it released.  I got it on PS4 first and was happily impressed.  I didn't rush through it because I knew this PC port was coming soon - and I can say with my personal opinion that I prefer the PC version since you've got more options to fumble around with (granted I am using my PS4 controller + Steam Big Picture so the controls are exactly the same).As most people on here will claim, to which I agree with, there are some optimization issues floating around.  Anything gamebreaking though? Not in the slightest. The vast majority of the issues (of which there aren't too many) relate to display issues and complaints about the FPS cap. In my experience, the open world gameplay and combat is always smooth with the FPS; cutscenes tend to drop some FPS but not terribly so.  There are workarounds to many of the issues (I play in Windowed and then hit alt-enter to expand it) - and I expect patches in the coming days anyhow.I've never seen a perfectly ported game, and NieR hasn't broken that record.  But it's a damn good port among a field of failed ones, and it's a damn good game in itself.  You'll come to love many of the characters and especially the combat I'm willing to bet.  Oh, and I almost forgot, the soundtrack!  Simply one of the most amazing game soundtracks ever created - they never distract and always add to the atmosphere.  NieR:Automata deserves your consideration because it is powerful.  The creators were passionate about this game and wanted it to be amazing, not your standard cookie-cutter AAA title or anything of the sort.  You'll experience haunting, sweet, action-packed, and thought-provoking moments all in one game.Replay is encouraged for more story/endings/achievements you may have missed.  Take your time and enjoy the game - it has plenty of assets to match its price tag :)			"

												A Yoko Taro Production.-NieR:Automata-In an age where censorship and 'social justice' invades and destroys video games everywhere, one man stood up for what he believed in and fought against the wicked ways of the west. His name, Yoko Taro. His ambition to create one of the greatest ActionRPGs of all time, starring one of the most gorgeous and interesting main characters of all time. His mission, a resounding success!NieR:Automata has given me something I thought I had lost long ago, hope. Not only for the future of RPGs, but for the future of the video game industry as a whole. It has been far too long since I have played a game that truly sent shivers down my spine, that made me feel something special, that inspired and perhaps most important of all; that was a total blast. NieR:Automata is all of this, and much more.I don't want to go into too many details because it would be a disservice to the masterpiece before you, instead I simply implore you to pick the game up and experience it yourself with as fresh eyes as possible. NieR:Automata is a breeze of fresh wind in many ways, the main character 2B is only one part of this, and although Yoko Taro's stance on the SJW BS that has been going on for far too long by itself is something to applaude, NieR:Automata is much more than eye candy and fan service.Beneath Yoko Taro's beautifully crafted characters, and his way of poking fun at SJWs (There's an achievement for 'observing 2B upclose 10 times'), lies a game that blew away my expectations on so many levels. Platinum games is responsible for the combat system, so perhaps it is no surprise that it feels extremely tight. If I were to make a comparison I would say it is somewhere between Bayonetta's fast paced and frantic action and Dark Souls' heavy, satistfying combat with hardhitting enemies with long windup animatons and well illustrated attacks that prevent them from ever feeling unfair.I have already touched on the character designs, which are striking in many ways, but there's much more to NieR:Automata's aesthetics than its characters and every component pulls its own to ensure this is one of the most breathtaking RPGs of all time. Emi Evans once again brings us beautiful vocals to accompany the already epic soundtrack that NieR:Automata boasts. If you have played the first NieR game or listened to its soundtrack then you know what to expect. Animation quality does not dissappoint either, in fact I dare say it is some of the most impressive in the whole industry. 2B moves with both power and grace when unleashing her plethora of different attacks, the larger enemies strike with overwhelming force that combined with the excellent sound design makes you wary of every blow. And simply walking along the many beautiful vistas the game has to offer has me in awe as the gentle movements of NieR:Automata's protagonists feel so expressive and, perhaps ironically, human when compared to similar titles in this day and age.There is an abundance of different sidequests to complete, fishes to catch and secrets to find on top of several different endings and routes. Available weapons range from short swords to long katanas to spears and lances of different types, and all the different weapon types feel unique and powerful in their own way. You can also customize your character's gear and interface in numerous ways allowing for a multitude of playstyles and possibilities. Upgrades to your weapons, abilities and powers are also present and feel worthwhile and most important of all, fun. The weapon upgrades increase your combo limit on top of adding extra effects, so they don't feel stale with simple '2% extra damage' that so many other RPGs tend to involve.NieR:Automata's story is something I do not wish to spoil, so I will leave it up to you to discover, but I can happily say that it tells a mature story that deals with difficult subjects such as religious fanaticism, free will and even what makes us human. Few, if any, choices feel black and white, right and wrong. Instead the characters all feel believable and the world they struggle to live in feels harsh, cruel and grounded in reality. The game will make you question yourself and think hard about what choices you make, and the outcome will not always be what you had hoped. The game will surprise you in many ways and make you feel things you might not have felt in a long time. Again, if I were to compare it to another game that did this very well, I would say that NieR:Automata and The Witcher 3 have much in common when it comes to how real and unfair many of the scenarios feel, and that's a very good thing in my eyes. Not all entertainment needs to be 'childish' in nature, and although I enjoy my mindless rampages in other hack and slash games as much as anyone else I welcome NieR:Automata's attempt to tell a story that is much bigger than itself and which dares to tackle more difficult subjects that are very much relevant in our real world. And as far as I am concerned, it does a very good job at it!I will refrain from saying much more, as I believe this is an experience one must witness with their own eyes.

												This game isn't 100% great for PC. But that's just the nature of the beast. And even then, there are pros and cons! So, if the pros or cons outweigh either of eachother, then well, you either should ignore or buy this!Pros:-Stylish fighter with eyes covered-The 2Booty-The Music-The gameplay is great. Platinum's got it going on.-The visuals are great.-The voice acting isn't trash.-The controls make sense if you try them for just a bitCons:-The frames are a little bit jumpy. The game just came out. It happens-The gameplay might end up grindy to some players-People complaining will attempt to steer you off of this game.What you NEED to know!-The game just came out for PC. Don't expect a flawless port immediately.-The cutscenes are prerendered at 30fps. That's not your game being bad.-Minimum specs are the absolute bare minimum. They are not suggesting it. If you think a GTX 760 is gonna play nice with this, you need a reality check.-You're buying a game on launch. PC games in general have rough launches. From server issues to not detecting GPUs. They get patched. If people on console can bare 30fps, so can you. Grow a pair.My specs are as follows, so I don't hit the recommended settings fully, but still.EVGA GTX 960 2 GB SSC16 GB of Rami7 4770k @ 3.5 GHzSabertooth Z87With this setup, I get 45 FPS. Which is very acceptable. So if you think that 120fps is the be all end all, that 4k is your life, and that not having fun is your jam, you probably shouldn't buy this. "

												Hmm, well again people don't look through the forums or information in the game before they start to complain. I've seen threads where people can't see that the game asks you to start before editing some settings. For me, the game runs really well, on all high except v-sync set to off. At the beginning you are faced with a side scroller / top down combat scenario, which I didn't think would be in the game. But it was actually really good and it encouraged me to become interested in the story. The only thing i'd say is that the game runs at 60fps throughout the fight scenes, but goes back down to 30fps in the cut scenes, but for me I don't mind. My system isn't the best either ( AMD 290, FX 8350, 16GB RAM) I will edit this review as I play more, but I wanted to post something as the complaints aren't all justified.Be warned: There isn't any auto-save feature haha, I made that mistake. I was 30mins in and totally forgot.Edit: This game is so good, it's just relentless with the difficulty. I really enjoy this game, you are really on edge, and you can't wait to get stuck in.			"

												Deep, powerful and unforgettable. I thought these would be the last words to describe NieR:Automata. Don't let 2B's wonderfully animated ♥♥♥ distract you from the story. The swordplay is fast and fluid but the level design of world is very lackluster, it's similar to those Early Access survival games. Also some people might be put off by the lack of voice acting this game has. While with these problems along with the somewhat shoddy PC port(fullsrceen problems, cut scenes locked at 30FPS, crashing on lower end GPU's) it's still good game if you want something unique.			"

												So my initial review was just something about 2B's butt, but now that I'm 33 hours in I think I can write a more informative review.The Good Things!1. The combat is fast, fluid, and simple but with enough depth to remain compelling.  The basic character action style is heavily streamlined here, so there's not a lot to memorize in regards to attacks which means straight out the gate you'll be getting in there and messing up robots.  This means the combat is less about stringing together fancy button pushes and more about avoiding all the insanity being thrown at you in the form of melee and big beach-ball sized bullets.  The special cooldown attacks you can slot are neat too - I like Mirage a lot m'self, where upon activated you character goes into a big anime-fueled flurry off light speed fast attacks that hit everything around you.2. This is basically multiple game types thrown in.  You'll be doing shmups, side scrolling shooters, twin stick shooters, character action combat, isometric combat, platformer combat.  i.e. the camera changes perspective a lot which keeps things fresh.3. Replay value.... well I mean technically it's not even replay value since later playthroughs actually add in new stuff or are outright continuations of the story.  Think of playthroughs more like chapters.  You'll play different characters who play a bit differently from one another.  One neat thing is that if you finished a side quest in a previous playthrough it won't show up again.4. 2B has an amazing butt and it's fun to look at it.  I have to include this considering how much time I spent with the camera panned down so I could stare at her hardware while running around.5. The music is great.  I usually turn music off in games, and this is one of the few games where I left it on.6. Game is pretty, lots of great environments and compelling use of lighting.7. The story is one of those weird stories where you'll have a lot of questions with only vague answers.  It's more forthcoming than dark souls plots.  A lot of the questions you'll find yourself asking are things like ""Why are combat androids modelled to look like cute girls with big butts, and why do they wear cute goth loli dresses?"" or ""why do they constantly breath heavy when they don't even have lungs?"".8. Has a good amount of customization going on thanks to the chips, which allow you to shift around your offensvie/defensive stats, add various features to your dodges or attacks like time slow or range attacks on melee.  I generally go for the glass cannon approach and just focus on making it so I can kill stuff as fast as possible.9. CONTENT! After several games where I payed sixty bucks for 8 hours of content I am incredibly happy to be playing a game where I am 33 hours into it and still less than halfway through.  I didn't spend my time doing anything other than completing quests either, so those 33 hours aren't padded with time-wasting exploration or anything like that, and I haven't died much so there haven't been many repeated segments.10. Runs great.  60 fps constantly, no bugs ( minus the one mentioned below ), and really just runs the way you expect a piece of software to run.The Bad Things!1. Fullscreen bug.  I'm sure you've heard of it.  I just played the game in windowed mode, didn't really bug me.2. While the combat is varied defensively, as in what you have to do to avoid death will change enough, offensively the game is rather samey with you basically thrashing your sword into stuff until it dies.  I would have liked to see more use of stuff like weak points and other mechanics to change up how you attack stuff.  It basically amounts to deciding if you're going to use aoe attacks or not, and using launchers for personal safety.  Still satisfying tho.3. Really struggling to find some bad stuff to say about this game.I give this game 9.5 android butts out of 10.			"

A masterpiece of a game.With NieR Gestalt/Replicant not selling very well, i'm so glad that this sequel even exists at all. NieR: Automata excels at everything that makes this a NieR game and have improved upon almost about every aspect from the original. Yoko Taro the director of this game along with Keiichi Okabe the composer of the beautifully written music of NieR have partnered with Platinum Games who are known for their action titles such as Bayonetta and Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, making what was lacking in the first game top notch.NieR: Automata is an open world action RPG set in the beautifully desolate far future of Earth where machines run rampant. The gameplay of NieR: Automata is mainly a hack and slash action game, but will switch up the camera orientation from third person to side scroller or top down in certain events to keep the game fresh with new perspectives. The game also mixes in bullet hell elements: allowing some enemies to shoot slow persistent projectiles making evading a fun challenge. Dodging is an essential part of the game as you can also pull off perfect evade to perform a flashy dodge which then will allow you to keep up your combo streak and even counter attacking.Customizing is a big part of this game, weapon types (small swords, large swords, spears and combat bracers) can be set in your light/heavy attacks allowing you to pull off different attacks depending if the weapon is equipped on light or heavy. Any combination of weapons used will have two unique weapon combo animation. Example light attack then interrupted by heavy attack will perform a new attack and vice versa. And depending on the weapon, some weapons have more light attack combos than heavy attack combos allowing the animation to be continued longer so choose your weapons wisely for your light/heavy attack slots. You can always customize your “plug-in chips” to alter your stats for your character to play the way you like. For example, you can increase additional health if you are a masochist and like getting damaged a lot, or if you are feeling like a turtle, nothing like a turning yourself into sonic won’t fix. For pod skills, you can customize your pods to perform special skills that go on a cool down system after being used, additionally you can find extra pods that have unique primary fires.For Platinum Game’s first open world game, don’t expect much, the world is decent for a first, on the bright side: great level design with well thought out hidden rooms, treasure placements and overall a beautiful world.Side quests are often pretty bland to complete, but some are exceptionally good and will give more insight about the story, history, characters and world of NieR.For fans of the first game, oh boy are you in for a surprise. There are tons of easter eggs and great references to the first.For the main story, it's extremely well thought out and convoluted, great pacing and may leave you in tears. Not going to write much about it as it is something that needs to experienced for yourselves to fully enjoy. After beating the game for the first time, beat it again to complete route B in a second playthrough. Trust. You won't regret it. Words cannot explain the great conclusion to this amazing game.Issues:  Currently there are some performance issues in the game which will hopefully be fixed soon.  After passing 1600x900 in screen resolution with full screen on: the screen is stretched making the game blurry. This however can be fixed by using a program called “Borderless Gaming” which is free program, but can also be purchased on steam to support the developer.Recommendations:  Use a controller to play this game, as the game was originally designed for the PS4.  Try to avoid searching on youtube with anything NieR related because spoilers may popping up in the recommended videos, which may kill your experience. Don’t forget to adjust your rotation sensitivity if it’s too sensitive, there are options for it.  Category Score   Gameplay 9/10   Story 10/10   Graphics 8/10   Music 11/10   Overall 9.5/10  "

												This Game is probably going to win or nominated for game of the year. so please buy it. it's worth every single penny you spend on it. Don't be fooled about having ""20hrs"" Gameplay. Game play including side quests (Mind you is probably like main quests coz characters development and actual plot from the quests affect the main quest) is probably roughly 50 hrs.Don't expect just a ""Slash and Dash"" Game.This game is more than meets the eye. The gameplay itself and it's heavily supported characters and story is going to leave you breathless.My ♥♥♥ Clenched about 80 times in 1 playthrough.Cons?>Longer please.Pros?>Story>Character>Gameplay>Story>CHARACTER GODAMMTP.S don't do prologue on Hard.Unless you want to end up like me spending almost 3 hours finishing it.So go.

												TLDR: 7/10 A great game let down by a bad port, but that's not the worst part, that's the difficulty, or complete lack thereof on normal and how the next one up turns it into get 1 shot by a lot of things mode. Good story, and world design which sadly doesn;t reach it's full potential as the game looks 4-6 years old. Combat, usually the best part is meaty, but also trivial.For: People who like action games and want a enjoyable storyNot for: People who like action games with a lot of bite, but also well balanced (Ninja gaiden, DMC etc)  So my first review of this was negative, but after playing more I think it's worth a shot, but be warned the port is not great and I'll delve into that in the last section so jump to there if you want to know.The game itself is a weird hybrid of twin stick and hack n slash, but for one reason I'd say more twin stick than hack n slash and that's because how viable never attacking with you melee weapons is, some cases needed to break armour but then you can just shoot and it's the safest and weirdly optimal way to play. Right as for the game,Pro's- Music, probably the best thing about this game if I'm honest, amazing all round suits the ""destroyed earth"" vibe that the game has.- Story, second best thing here, very intriguing and unique, I don;t really want to delve into it but for those who like story you have something interesting to keep an eye on here.- Gameplay, the mixture of constantly shooting, being ultra mobile and the fantastic melee combos make combat a blast, but it does have a huge downside in difficulty which i'll mention.- Crafting, I like the fusing of ""chips"" which are basically perks for your lcharacter like melee damage, health etx, andyou can fuse multiple same levelled ones to make stringer ones (like in Resident Evil REvelations for anyone who has played that)Also Weapons can be upgraded via finding the right components and spending some money, these aren't minor upgrades byt rather substantial. - World design, while lacking in pure graphically fidlity the game does look good in places and the world/levels play very well. Negatives- Difficulty By far the biggest problem with this game. their are 4 difficulties in this those being ""easy"" designed for people who want story or who are disabled (not joking, they made it so you can play one handed and enjoy the game, pros for this) next is ""normal"" where the game recommends you play for the most enjoyable difficulty, however I have found this to be too easy and with the lock on that comes with this difficulty its not as fun as I'd like since I like a challenge, but the next one up is too big of a jump ""Hard"" So you'll think why not just play hard then? Well the jump from normal to hard is about 3x or more in terms of enemy damage, that leaves you in a spot where most things outside the weaker mobs will 1 shot you, first boss 1 shot, a pig, 1 shot. I don't find this a satisfying difficulty, just a poorly balanced annoying one which makes the ranged combat even more viable and the actual melee less relevant than ever to be safe. ""Very hard"" made for you sadists, every enemy will one shot you, perfection is required (I actually like this being here as a option)So i think there needs to be something between normal and hard in terms of enemy damage (also difficulty doesn;t seem to aggect enemy type or attacks, just damage)- Combat design, I'm not sure where to put this but you have infinite number of dodges with no to little space inbetween, and also unlimited range attacks with no cooldown. Since dodging makes you immune to a lot of attacks it leaves the game in a weird place where the optimal method seems to be never let go of the fire button and always spam the dodge button.- Fast travel, there is one, thank god. But sadly it's locked behind story progression, which makes the first set of side quests a annoying run back and forth across the map. - Last but not least, the intro of this game. it's bad. Not as in what you do isn't fun, because it is. just there is no save point before the first boss, which is around 45 mins or so. Since the game uses no autosave it means that if you die anywhere in this opening sequence you have to start the game all over again, made worse by the first set of cutscene/dialogue bein unskippable. And for anyone playing on hard I would even recommend do the intro on normal then turn up to hard after just for your own sake. (There is no achievement for difficulty as far as i know)Port and my specs: GTX 1070, Xeon 2630v3, 16GB DDR4 (and no I'm CPU locked, my GPU goes full load here) -Game renders at 900p then upscales to your res, this makes the game look blurry, and also means that the Steam overlay is unusable for me @ 1440p- Settings are limited but managable- 60fps lock, this seems to be here for no reason, as lower fps doesn;t cause slow down I don;t think animations are tied to this, just lazyness - Performance, its bad, I see a lot of people saying its not but they also don't seem to understand context at all. Like ""Well my GTX 1080 gets 60fps at 1080p therefore it's great"" forgetting this game runs at 900p,doesn;t look good and that sort of GPU gets around 100fps @ 14400p usually. This game looks pretty bad from a point of pure graphical quality, textures can be PS3 level and so can the environments, and it dips to 45fps on my GTX 1070, the way this game looks it shouldn;t dip on any modern hardware. Worst looking AAA in years, runs at half the FPS BF1 does, or Doom, lower FPS than the Division, Witcher 3 etc,  go figure.			"

												Wow, I honestly don't even know where to start with this review. I have not been blown away by a game on this level in such a long time and I feel somewhere in my heart I won't find another game to match this feeling at all. I had high expectations for NieR:Autotmata but it surpassed it in every single way. The story was told beautifully and was very complex and deep. The music for the game was absolutely stunning and easily one of the best OST I have heard in a game. I don't believe there was a single piece of music from this game that I didn't like. I'm going to try and keep this review fair with my pros and cons with it, as well as avoid any major spoilers as much as possible.StoryI can't delve too far into the story without spoiling anything but I can give a little insight on it. NieR:Automata is a sequel from the Original NieR game, but it's not connected where you have to play the original NieR to understand this game. From what I've read as I did not play the original NieR, this game takes place thousands of years after the original. There are a few tidbits that will make reference to the original and a few characters from the original do make a return but nothing that will hamper you from playing the game. The story starts off about a war between androids and machines  who were created by aliens. Humanity had to escape to the moon in order to survive and sent androids to rid the machines and aliens so life on earth can resume once again. As you progress through the game, you will see how deep it really begins to hit, how little things that seemed insignificant at first actually play a deeper role in the meaning of the story. Taro Yoko did a fantastic job at a story that really toys with the ""what does it mean to be human"" aspect and that made the story that much stronger and hold a bigger connection with it. GraphicsThe graphics for this game were absolutely beautiful. From the crisp feel of the grassland, to how clear the water looks, excellent lens flair from the sun and overall textures of your surroundings. I will admit (which I will touch more in the cons) there are some areas that look lackluster graphic wise, however the overall world of NieR has beautiful graphics that really set the mood for what is happening at that moment. SoundtrackThis soundtrack was phenomenal. As I said before, I can't think of a single piece of music from this game that I didn't like. I am honestly one of the people who hate vocals in game music, except for maybe credits or a cutscene, but then I played this game and the vocals with the music blew me away. I really love the idea they did with the music where it will change based on the mood of the game, whether it's a scripted event or just completing a quest. A quest or scripted event will change based on the mood of that moment. It's fantastic and it makes the game have a stronger connection as during those moments you see how music can quickly change your overall mood within the game and what's going to happen next.GameplayVery interesting with how this game has played out. It's a hack and slash game, but also carries aspects of Bullet Hell, Open World exploration and of course an RPG/JRPG. A few of my friends have compared aspects with the game having a feel of Dark Souls and Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance which I won't argue their points with that.One thing I really liked is the Network System that was added in. Basically if you choose to connect to that, any player who has died in a certain spot in the world, you will find their body which you can choose to retrieve and in turn will give you a certain amount of Gold and a temporary boost to 3 stats. You can also choose to revive them and have them as a temporary ally to help you fight until they either die or blow up from being alive for too long or you leaving them behind by dashing faster than they can hope to keep up with you.ConsOnto the cons which I know can either break a deal for people but I want to be fair with this review.- The game had a bumpy launch, I won't even try to deny that. It was bumpy as it there were some users who couldn't play the game on a 960m, 960, 970, RX 480 and even the Pascal GPUs. People were mentioning either really low FPS, white screens or flat out crashes. This had me worried as I was planning to play the game on 4k, while most of these people were on 1080p and having these issues. Thankfully this was not an issue for me and 4k ran without any issues. Some people in the community have made their own little fixes for now that can help you play the game or get the desired FPS if you're playing on a lower-end system. The devs are working on their own patches on this game to get everything up and running for everyone.- Cut scenes are capped to 30 FPS. Capped FPS is a word that will turn a lot of people off and I don't blame you. The cut scenes would look absolutely stellar if they were uncapped, even with the cap I love how the graphics look for cut scenes. I can only wait until they're uncapped. Some users have mentioned the audio isn't fully correct in the cut scenes and that FPS can also tank; I have not had any of those happen to me but I want to mention it just as a small heads up.- Apparently the game was locked at 900 resolution for users, even if you had a monitor with a much higher resolution. This wasn't the case for me, but others have to use 3rd party programs such as Borderless Window in order to have the max resolution of their monitor.- Earlier I mentioned there were some parts of the game that had poor graphic spots. Most of the time I noticed this by windows where the sun was showing in, where the glare from the sun would look a little blurry and/or pixelated. The Castle in the Forest is the best example I can think of with this issue. Other than that, I've only really seen it a few times when near water and at a weird camera angle.- This personally isn't a con for me, but I know it will be a con to others. This game can be tedious at the start. You will be doing a lot of back tracking until you progress far enough into the story where you can freely transport between places you have discovered. Quests will have you running back and forth. Item collection will require you to grind enemies to further increase your level and give you items to survive at the later levels. If you're someone who enjoys this stuff, it won't be a con at all for you, but I know some people prefer to play games as quickly as possible without having to grind or backtrack a lot.Summary- Fantastic story that has a deep meaning behind it and really sucks you into the world of NieR. A very serious, touching and at times has it's funny moments.- Music that keeps the mood and setting of the game which further delivers the experience to you and makes the moment feel more alive that it would be without the music.- Beautiful graphics that really shine no matter where you're at in the world, giving you a whole new outlook on what is around you at those times and scenery you won't forget.- Gameplay was a perfect mix of adventure, attacking and of course story telling. Enemies scale with your level and the world around you changes as time goes on.- 2B's thighs thoConclusion NieR was the perfect game for me. Honestly it messed me up after finishing what routes I've finished already because I feel in my heart I won't find a game to match this story. I have never felt connected to a story at all, especially on an emotional level, but NieR honestly went above and beyond my exceptions with everything that came with it. It has easily become one of, if not my favourite game. It's a game I will always cherish to own and be a part of. The story, gameplay, music. 10/10.I honestly cannot recommend a game more than Nier;Automata and I hope Taro Yoko gets the recognition he deserves from this masterpiece!			"

												Loving all the negative reviews for this. Not a single one is about the game, but how apparently it's a ""bad port"". Which it's not. Runs fine on my machine, try upgrading your toasters and not playing on some ancient laptop, yeah?-Gameplay is great-Characters are fun and enjoyable to watch/listen to-Looks great-OST is godly and so is 2B's behindAs for the fullscreen complaint, I will agree on that. Hopefully that will be patched soon, but as of now using Borderless Gaming completely fixes it.			"

												NieR:Automata, well where do I start? In NieR:Automata, You will follow the story of 3 kinds of androids, a combat type, her companion and a fugitive prototype. In a world almost under full control of the machines, you are here to take back your planet against these machines. Glory To Humanity!PROS- Fantastic story- Amazing soundtrack- English/Japanese voice options- Different combos and abilities for different weapons- 26 endings - A beautiful and well made world, with the soundtrack it makes it that much betterCONS- Enemies are a set level and won't increase if you go back to a certain chapter- At launch, there has been some issues for people to a point they can't even start the game. This was an issue with both the user and the company- No soundtrack dlc, I'd leave the game open alone just to listen to itOverallThis has been one of the best games I've played in a long time, with it being a JRPG. Even for a completionist, the game itself for achievements or even full data information completion isn't to a point that it just feels grindy or repeatitive. This was also my first game I've ever played made by Yoko Taro, So I'll deffo be keeping an eye for any other games with this guy involved. Hopefully they will fix the optimization issues soon so that many others who are unable to play at this time can enjoy the game as much as I have.			"

 REVIEW WILL BE KEPT AS SPOILER FREE AS POSSIBLE Boy, has Platinum delivered alright.So after finally beating the game and seeing its (many) endings, I can safely say that this is an absolute masterpiece of a game and it is easily my favourite of all time, and that is not a statement I am making lightly.This is quite literally the best game I have ever played, and it will be a very long while before anything tops this. Gameplay Why is this game so good? For starters, the gameplay is some of the most fun I've ever had in ages. I can always count on Platinum to make fun gameplay due to Metal Gear Rising, and Nier: Automata's gameplay seems pretty reminiscent to MGR. They also pull off very interesting camera work depending on where you are, and the perspective shifts are seamless and work extremely well. Combat is very hack-and-slash, and intensely satisying. It's also extremely satisfying wielding the weapons themselves, they feel pretty damn great. You get quite a decent variety, from swords to bigger swords, to spears and fists. There's quite a few weapons in each category and they all offer unique bonuses once fully upgraded, encouraging weapon variety instead of just trashing one and never using it because it has lower damage numbers than the other. Combat is insanely fun, weapons are very fun to use, and it is an absolute blast fighting the machines (tip: fully upgraded combat bracer weapons are REALLY GOOD late game). Music The soundtrack is probably the best aspect of this game. Whoever composed it is an absolute genius. All of the tracks fit in very well with their current situations, and they all sound absolutely fantastic and fitting in every concievable way. One detail I find very neat is how dynamic the background music is. Depending on where you are in the area, the music will change accordingly. It will go to a quieter, more instrumental version in quieter areas, and then get to its full complexity, with all instruments and vocals present in the main areas. The background music can also change depending on the mood of some characters, for instance if you finish a sidequest where everything ends well then the music changes to a very calm and serene track, likewise it will turn very sombre and dark if things didn't turn out as well. I found this an extremely neat little detail, and I didn't see a whole lot of games doing that. The soundtrack overall is absolutely fantastic work, and the work of a genius. Story The story was absolutely fantastic. This game will make you feel good, make you feel miserable, and make you feel one hell of a rollercoaster as you play it because it has some insane twists. This, I think, is the only game to have made me play so much consecutively in order to finish it and find out what happens next. Now that I have seen every possible finale in the game (well, not counting the 20+ joke endings), I can safely say that this was the most intriguing and interesting story I have experienced. Even though this game is set in the Nier and Drakengard universe, you needn't play those games to fully enjoy this game I've been told, you'll only miss out on some references which are briefly explained in the game anyway via intel documents. Character development is fantastic and well-paced, and I love how the characters developed throughout the story. You can tell this was written by somebody who absolutely knew what they were doing. I find it pretty interesting how you have to play through the game multiple times in order to get the full picture, and they pulled that off very well. The 'true' finale, if you can call it that, and all the other finales are among the best I have ever seen in a game. It was one of those moments where you sit back for a while and briefly take in what you just experienced.  tl;dr do I reccomend this game? Yes. All of my yes, I 100% reccomend this game, please get it as soon as you can. I feel it's a must-have, and is easily well worth every penny and every minute of your time. One of the few games where I actually bothered to complete every sidequest and try to 100% because the world and its environments were just that interesting. Expertly crafted everything, from characters to the environemnts, the story and soundtrack. This game is near-perfect, and has everything you could possibly you want. The only issues are a few PC port issues that are easily fixable if you google around, and once those are patched out this game will be flawless.11/10, please get it as soon as you can.			"

												This game is a masterpiece.Play through at least 3 times, you will not regret it. 1 Playthrough is not the full story.Each playthrough will take you roughly 20-30 hours depending on how much side quest content you do and what difficulty you play on.Art direction is top notch, story is well written, combat is fun and engaging the whole way through. I can't really talk about why the story is good without spoilers, so just trust me and other reviewers on this point. The soundtrack is 10/10 and the songs all change dynamically to fit situations. There's 4-6 variations of every song that change in complexity and volume depending on what's happening in the scene. This game really knows how to craft mood.The only negative thing I can say are that some of the side quests are simple tedious fetch quests, but the focus is on the main story. The side quests mainly exist to give you a chill period to reflect on the world and the events, but that doesn't excuse the tedium in some of them.Oh and you might need a fan-made patch if your graphics card is too old to run this game smoothly. I needed it for my GTX960 to bump my FPS from 40 to 60 during fights. It exists, seek it out.Everything else is damn near flawless. Going into more details would be spoilers so just go buy the game already.			"

												This is hack & slash rpg with platforming and battles inspired of bullet hell games made by Yoko Taro and Platinum games and published by Square Enix. Story is about how humans from moon created androids trying to retake earth from machines. Story itself is interesting with some traditional japanese storytell elements. In this game there's not that much side quests but most of them add something to the story, characters and because of that they're not a chore and interesting to do. Gameplay is like in most of the hack & slash games, you have melee weapons (short, long swords, spears, gauntlets) and Pod with range attacks and over 10+ different programs and of course you need to dodge enemy attacks. 2B have fast light attacks for first weapon and slow heavy for a second weapon. 9S have fast attacks and hacking ability via 2D shooter minigame. Also there'e bullet hell style mecha fights against machines, platforming fights. There's variety for boss battles but most of them can be finished with only range attacks and running in circles. RPG elements in this game is mostly a lvl based enemies and your character stats and chips (upgrades) they use space between 5-18 and maximum capacity is 128. There's 4 different style chips one for HUD, attacks, defense and utility so you can adjust by your playstyle just be careful because after death if you will not retrive your own body you will lost them for good. Game have 3 different PT. In second PT you play with different character (9S) and you have some new hacking side quests, some new cutscenes for story missions and third PT (A2 and 9S) is totally different with continuing story after previous PT,  with some new gameplay elements. Every PT can take you from ~ 7 to 18 hours depending on your pace. This game have 5 real endings and 20 joke, bad endings for meeting various criteria, fialing your objective. This lets you see story form different points but for some players it can be chore because for a full story you need play in the same map against the same enemies just with different character, some missions three time. Voice acting is only in the main quests, open world isn't that big and you can only explore for new weapons and resources to upgrade them. Soundtrack in this game is incredible and reminds me old japanese anime like Ghost in the Shell (1995 version), Neo Genesis Evangelion. Most of the game world backstory is in well hidden chest that can be only unlocked with 9S. And sad that this port have issue like nearlly all new AAA games port: cutscenes for pc is running in 900p 30 fps, there's still unfixed fullscreen bug and some map textures aren't well polished like characters models. I still recommend NieR:Automata for japanese actions games fans.			"

												If you are a fan of the previous nier than you will probably like this. Don't want to say too much, but performance is fine atleast on a high end rig (easily getting 60fps, 1440p max settings with a 1070). Only problems are if you don't like the genre (some schmup, simple character action game, think transformers devastation, but with way simpler combos). Music, setting, story, style, animations are all top notch. Only thing that kind of lacks is that some areas are a bit bland, but it looks impressive where it counts.Fullscreen seems to be bugged, so you have to use windowed to get the proper res. Some cutscenes also seem to drop to 15fps, even though they are prerendered at 30 (I think, on the ps4 demo I saw the same cutscenes and didn't notice anything). I'm not sure about performance on low end machines, or how KB+M controls are.The only other thing is to be careful when you start the game, don't want to spoil it, but there is a decent amount of gameplay without any save points, so you don't really want to die and have to do it again, first time through I wouldn't go higher than normal, atleast until a save point.

												I'd like to start by saying that this is an amazing game and by far my favorite game to have come out so far this year. However the PC port appears to have some problems which prevent me from enjoying this game. Specifically the crashing during the 30+ minute intro which prevents me from making any progress.I'm sad to say I've wasted 3 hours on the intro because it keeps locking up and crashing, and there is no save points for the first 30-40 mins of the game. So having to redo this intro about 7 times because of crashes when my pc exceeds the minimum requirements is a tad unacceptable. I really want to retract this review as soon as possible as that will mean they have fixed and optimized the game, but until then I can't recommend a game that will crash before it even allows you to make progress. I bought this on pc because after beating the ps4 version a couple times I was aching to play this on pc with less framerate issues and better performance (although there were few to begin with), unfortunately what I've got is a game that is currently not playable for me... Which is a shame because this is definately my favorite game so far to have come out this year...Specs:Windows 10 64bitGPU: Nvidia 780gtxProcessor: I5 3.4ghz Quad CoreRam: 16gb			"

												Back when I played the Original Nier game on my PS3 I became obsessed with Yoko Taro's work after managing to complete the game with all it's endings. I went back and played Drakengard 1, 2 (not really a Yoko Taro game) and Drakengard 3 and, even though these all were great games, the same issue was present in each of the games: the gameplay, the lack of budget.Nier was an improvement over the first 2 Drakengard games. The game came from one of the multiple endings Drakengard had, a joke ending even. Nier became a full-fledged action RPG in the process. It had decent graphics and the gameplay was somewhat enjoyable. The story, I will probably never forget it. Still, other that from the captivating story and characters, the low budget had evidently affected the game. Even so, it was just that good, so good that it became one of my favorite games of all time. Drakengard 3 also had some amazing ideas built in but, sadly, the technical state of the game made it very difficult to play due to staggerinly low framerates most of the time. Still, again, I loved the story, the characters and the setting.See, Yoko Taro is a genius, a genius at telling stories. He tells stories in ways other directors would be scared of even touching on, he breaks taboos in unique ways while managing to stay humble and loyal to his own work. When Nier Automata was announced my heart skipped a beat and when it was confirmed that Platinum Games were the ones in charge of the action direction I knew that, at last, we were in presence of a masterpiece in the making. I wasn't wrong.After playing around 68 hours and achieved and explored everything the game has to offer Nier Automata has become one of my favorite games of all time, definitely my favorite modern game of all time. This time around its not just the god-tier level story that makes this game legendary, but it's fluid and stylish, yet simple, combat and overall action-RPG gameplay. Why do I say that Yoko Taro is a genius storyteller? One would have to play Nier Automata multiple times to come to that realization. The game doesn't end in just one playthrough, it builds up for the next one and each time one finishes a playthrough the game gets even better and better pushing the player to keep up unraveling what is in store next. At the end of it all, you end up immersed and extremely touched with the outcomes of the story, this is true in all of Yoko Taro's games, specially in Automata.While the characters are built on popular Japanese stereotypes, the story is just so immersive that these cliches go on overlooked and even manage to make us get in touch with the characters feelings in such ways that no other videogame has achieved up to now.Alongside Yoko Taro, Okabe Keiichi has been working with him on the soundtracks from the original Nier onwards. Nier Soundtrack is, probably, my favorite videogame soundtrack of all time. I stand corrected now, it was. Okabe has gone way beyond excellence with Nier Automata's Soundtrack and has composed another masterpiece that fits the overall quality of this game. Platinum also did an excellent job like they did with Metal Gear Rising in managing the pacing of the action with the BGMs. It all feels natural, connected. The music in this game definitel plays a huge part on what the game expresses and in how does it do it.Basically, one can play Nier Automata without playing the Original Nier game. The intel data you find during the caharacters journey helps the player grasp the situation and the state of this post-apocaliptic world. The best outcome though, is to have played the original Nier as there are very special surprises here for followers of the franchise that are greatly appreciated and add even more to the game.As for the port goes, I cannot call it a bad port because the PS4 and PS4 Pro versions of the game also were launched presenting issues. Luckily for the PC community, there is a mod that vastly improves performance with just a minimal hit in graphical quality and fixes some other issues like fullscreen support for some users and framerate smoothing. The game has some other technical issues (like stuttering 30 fps capped  pre-rendered cutscenes), that is a fact; nothing that makes it unplayable or substracts fom the experience though.Honestly, I'm just happy that Yoko Taro finally was able to give us a true AAA game that can actually appeal to the masses while remaining true with his genius storytelling. This isn't the best Platinum Games action title around in terms of gameplay, that is true. There are games like Bayonetta and Metal Gear Rising around that completely nail down action gameplay aspects and depend on them, but this game has some refined action that complements one of the best stories ever told in a game.I cannot recommend this game is enough, it is one of the best examples of why are videogames considered art. This is one of those media products that couldn't have turned anything else than a videogame. Nier Automata is the pinnacle of Yoko Taro's work resulting in one of the best gaming experiences of all time.			"

This review is for the current version of the game(3/18/17) ~NO SPOILERS~What is NieR:Automata? This  is the latest installment of the Nier series, which is itself a spin-off of the Drakengard series. This game takes place in the middle of a war between what's left of mankind and strange machines of alien origin. Mankind has been greatly culled and driven from the Earth by these machines, and you must help reclaim it with the help of your companions! Oh, and don't forget to uncover the mystery behind the invasion.Positives:This game creatively blends many genres such as beat-em up, shoot'em up, hack'n'slash, RPG, and more.Combat is buttery, responsive, and feels very polished. You can almost feel the weight behind attacks.Character movement feels just as good as the combat. Very buttery, very precise.You can upgrade and customize and personalize yourself as well as your gear in a vast amount of ways.Beautifully designed open world full of interesting things for you to find(like hidden areas, treasures, etc).The story, banter, NPC dialouge, writing in general is absolutely top-notch and hooks your interest from the beginning.Loads of different environments to keep things interesting.The voice acting is top notch.The enemies change over the course of the story.Very clever use of the movement mechanics to get around the world. Parkour, platforming, interactions, etc.Pieces of the HUD are actually chips you can equip, unequip, buy, and sell.The bosses are extremely well designed and stay with you even after you beat them.Multiple endings as expected! Replay value anyone?Quick load timesEvery key is rebindable, but I highly recommend a controller.The soundtrack is easily and honestly one of the best I have ever heard from a game in recent memory.Negatives:Based on what I've gathered, you need a modern medium to high end PC to run this game at 60 FPS.Full screen doesn't seem to work properly for a lot of people.The default keyboard controls may cause frustration for some, I recommend rebinding immediately.Cutscenes are pre-rendered and run at 30 FPS. I'm unsure if every cutscene does this, however.Very disappointing amount of graphics options for a modern PC game.The game does not inform you that if you die during the prolouge sequence, you must completely start over.Denuvo DRM is unfortunately present, and will hopefully be removed in the future.Some textures look good while some are blurry and just out of place.So is it worth it?This game is not for people who care a lot about high end next-gen graphics, it's not for people who don't care about story, and it's not for people who need their hand held.  If you have a PC that can run this game well enough, and you like what you see so far, then yes I would say it's absolutely worth buying. It's clear a lot of polish and love went into this game(perhaps not the port), and it really shines through as you're playing. The story is excellent, deep, and will make you think. The combat is intense, inventive, and always gripping. The world's interconnected environments has been carefully designed, sculpted, and polished in a way that allows for interesting discoveries and freedom of movement within. Gaming in 2017 is starting off strong!(Did you like this review? If so, please vote it up! Feel free to add me and check out my Steam Group.)			"

												Oh man, where do I start.First Yoko Taro's game I played was Drakengard 3 back in 2014. It was a terrible game, but something kept me playing it until I managed to get platinum trophy. Game was nearly unplayable, but I loved the story so much, at the start it was so trashy and Ending A somehow reminded me of something only Tarantino would pull off, but still I managed to get ending C where the whole story gets a new perspective and, well, I nearly cried at the Ending D, it was so good, I loved every character and this chaotic atmosphere. Then, I played Nier and it didn't disappoint. Interesting storytelling approach, risky and unusual game design choices, not every director has balls to pull this off.Well, did I jump in the ♥♥♥♥ing hype train when Automata was announced on E3 back at 2015? Of course I did, and I can't express with words how happy I was: Game directed by Yoko Taro? MADE BY PLATINUM GAMES? I'll buy 20, just release it already! The hype bar was so high I started to fear that I'll be dissappointed because it'll not meet my expectations. At the end, I'm just glad I was wrong.NieR:Auromata™ is not really good Platinum Games game, but it certainly is a ♥♥♥♥ing good NieR game. Action-packed Slasher/Action Adventure game with RPG elements and shmup sequences, it's not deep enough for a Platinum, but I'm not expecting something bigger from Nier gameplay-wise. What I expect is the story with a clear message to players, and Yoko Taro did it just right and he did it much better than I expetcted. I just can't get out of my head that one pharse in ending E (Being alive is pretty much a costant stream of emarrasment), it's just my whole life, I was touched deeply.To the other strong part of the game, soundtrack, it's godlike. If you've asked me which is the best soundtrack for a videogame 2 years ago I would definetly say NieR, but this is the whole new level. Keiichi Okabe created 60% of the game atmoshpere. I stayed in the amusment park for 30 minutes or more just listening to this creepy yet so beautiful song that played there, and that's only a tip of the iceberg. Can't wait for the realese of full OST.Not to mention that this game has a lot of references to World War II (and you're pretty much a Third Reich's unit who's helping japanese forces on Pacific front, which is kinda silly, but still), enthusiasts are welcome.Despite all the flaws I highly recommend this game, It's something you'll never experience in videogame. And it's a personal GOTY for me this year. P.S: If you're new to the series, you can play this game safely, but I still recommend to play the original game, this way you can get more DAT FEELS from the game, and I mean like 60% more, and yes, for the first time in Taroverse this is a direct sequel.P.S.S. Check forums before buying, game has some issues, though there is a fix and official patch will be avaible soon.			"

If the mentioned problems are patched, I'll swap this PC port review for a proper game review.The good:- Game seems to be a lot of fun- Perfomance on a stock 2500K, 8 GB ram and 970 is a locked 60 fps, and thus as advertisedThe bad:Overall:- Full screen is bugged, always blurry, upscaling from 900p to my native of 1080p- Cutscenes are obviously FMV and run at or below 30 fps- The game stutters sporadically, although running from an SSD- It freezes on random occasions, forsing me to end task, and making it impossible to get even to the first save spotKeyboard and mouse controls:- Mouse ""freelook"" is emulating controler analog pad acceleration, making it very, very clumsy and imprecise to use- In the game's standard 3rd person perspective, you can't look or aim down with the mouse- Mouse buttons can't be remapped- When the game shifts to a side-scrolling or top-down perspective, the direction of firing bullets is locked strictly to 8 directions, making aiming very difficult- Dodge (an essential command) is solely tied to double-tapping directional keysI must mention that I don't own a gamepad and probably never will. I've played many games on PC, including many 3rd person ones, and have never had problems playing them with KB&M.For me, Nier Automata is impossible to play - firstly because of the s♥♥♥♥♥dic lock-ups, and secondly, because of the conrols. This is the first time I regret making a preorder (can't refund it anymore).I sincerely hope the devs do patch these quirks because the game looks to be unbelievably fun.			"

												Clarity Edit:I bought this game from a non-Steam vendor, a discount was the necessary half-measure to caution for me to buy a game on day one, so a refund was never in the picture.You can see the time I've spent in the game. You can't see the time I've spent out of the game researching how to get it to run at the resolution I have chosen in fullscreen or not stutter regardless of the graphical load (I do have a good setup and am no stranger to tweaking for performance). I can tell you that my time out of the game is at least comparable to that in game. The speed of action and quality of artistic work in this game almost demand graphical fidelity to be fully appreciated.Learn a lesson from my impatience to buy what supposedly is a good game at its core from a developer that I want to encourage to release for the PC. But if they will not support their game on our platform, neither should we. At $60 this is wholly unacceptable.Addendum:Third-party patches and utilities now make this game roughly playable (with occasional, unanticipatable complete freezes of the game) so I am continuing to play this game that apparently deserves almost ubiquitous rave reviews. Technical problems aside, it's at least a decent game, though really its only outstanding quality (25 hours in) is its variability, which has mostly been in camera angles and 2 (or just now at 25 hours, 3) combat mechanics. It has otherwise been broadly mediocre.I entirely intend to update this review when I finally figure out what I've been missing in this game that elevates it to greatness.			"

												Well after seeing that Squeenix held off on review code, and the game's stupid high specs, I had concerns that it would either have a ton of issues or run like crap. Turns out it has both.The game in fullscreen does not work. It seems to render the game at a low res (either 720p or 900p) and upscale it to whateber res you choose. This results in incredibly blurred visuals on top of it being interlaced instead of preogresive.As for performance, those store specs are bang on. The game looks awful and would indeed need a 980 to hold 60 on High with no drops. And thats at 1080p (or whatever res it actually is). 1400p/4k? Forget it lolSquare enix cannot for the life of them port a game that works properly in fullscreen mode (if it even has one to begin with). This is square japan I refer to and not the western branch that uses nixxes etc for their ports.As of right now, I cannot recommend this game in its current state. having to use a program like borderless gaming to maximise a window (the game lacks borderless too btw) is unacceptable when even sodding indie studios can do better.

												EDIT: To those of you who think it's unfair that I'm giving the game a thumbs down, I cannot with good conscience recommend something that doesn't play through the tutorial without crashing on an Nvidia 780 Ti card, 16GB of RAM and an Intel i7 core with 3.4GHz. I'm ok with performance drops, not with outright crashing into unplayability.I THINK this is a good game. It feels like it from the tutorial. The tutorial which I've played about eight or nine times now because the game is constantly crashing, there's no autosave functionality and some good distance before you're allowed to save, as I've never reached that point before crashing. Even with the unofficial community patch that's out now, I'm still having a lot of issues. And yes I'm playing on an Nvidia card with an Intel i7 GPU so I'm not having any of those AMD-issues, it's crashing for an assortment of reasons, unfortunately.I'll write a proper review once the game gets fixed. Until then, I can't really recommend something that's as unstable as this. It still works for a lot of people but it seems to be a lottery of hardware and driver-combinations whether or not you're one of those people.Still, I don't regret buying the game, just hoping there's some official fixes coming soon.

												There is huge mouse lag with the camera and you can only make it bearable by reducing the Pursuit Speed to zero and increasing the vertical/horizontal speed of the camera significantly.Also I am constantly patting my little robot buddy in the middle of fights because moving left/right with the mouse somehow mimicks the input of swiping the PS4 touchpad.There are further issues with graphics, resolution at 1440p does not work. And 1080 resolution does not render truly at 1080p. The game is locked at 60fps and cutscenes at 30fps which have constant microstutter.I would definitely not consider this a good port. Other than that the game is very good.			"

												I won't reiterate all the technical issues this game has currently for the majority of owners, including the starry eye'd fans giving it high praise despite acknowledging it barely runs for them. I'm just going to mention the one that affects me directly.The entire Nvidia 7xx series of GPUs have constant crashing, every 10~15 minutes. Here is a steam community thread about it: http://steamcommunity.com/app/524220/discussions/0/135511913382921167/If you have a 780 Ti, 780, 760, or 770 - DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IN IT'S CURRENT STATE. WAIT FOR A PATCH BEFORE BUYING.I cannot recommend this game to anyone not running a literally state-of-the-art bleeding-edge gaming beast (I'm talking top end hardware, 1080 GTX, 6th gen i7, 16GB corsair ram, etc). And let's stop to think about that for a second. This is a PS4 PORT, which runs at 1080p 60fps LOCKED on console. Yeah, no. SquareEnix really screwed up and this port is absolute trash.			"

												I rather enjoyed the game but it has some problems. If your playing on Keyboard and mouse your in for a time. The controls are poorly laidout and you can't bind commands to your mouse button.Game is locked to 60 FPS and Full screen is borked as texture don't scale beyond 900p properly unless you use windowed mode. I had to play in 1980x1200 to deal with this as my main monitor is  1440p. Cut sceens are pre rendered and run at 30 fps so if your senstive to that sort of change the transistion is exceptionally jarring. NO boardless window mode is a sin and you should feel bad for not having this platinum games.Once you get past the poor KB/M controls the game is actually pretty fun. Hacking is ♥♥♥♥ fest on Keyboard though. Story is 7/10 and gameplay is soild 8/10. Defiantly worth the buy but I would reccomend a controler for this game.			"

												First things first, let's get the stuff about the port out of the way.Yes, the port isn't the best. But it's servicable. It helps if you mess around with the settings. Play the game in windowed mode and not only will it perform better but it'll actually render 1080p and above resolutions instead of just upscaling 900p. Because of this I highly recommend installing ""Borderless Gaming"" or something similar so you can run the game without a visible window while still being in windowed mode. Next, lower or completely turn off AA in the settings, then force FXAA from the Nvidia Control Panel or whatever the equivelent is for AMD. It will make the game look and run better. Once you do this, just be aware that: The KB+M controls are kinda bad and a controller is highly recommended. If you're using a Playstaion 4 controller, you'll need DS4Windows to let the game recognize it.Now, onto the game itself:It's fantastic. The gameplay is a mix of hack n slash and bullet hell that is challenging yet usually not unfair. It's fast and require quick reflexes, especially on higher difficulties. The bosses are also a ton of fun that are all unique from one another. Most of them have bullet hell as part of the fight but there's usually still plenty of time to get melee hits in. The characters are really well done and there's no weak character story wise, each one has their own personality that makes them stand out, and all of them are enjoyable in some way. The story itself will leave you near tears at some points, because it does get fairly depressing, but it's still one of the best stories in a game out there atm. The open world itself has a ton of varied and really cool areas to explore, such as an abandoned city that really feels empty outside of a few areas, and a desert that's vast and seems like it goes on forever. And last but not least, the soundtrack to the game is phenomenal. It's easily one of the best soundtracks you'll hear in any game, and the songs themselves play a big part in the game so I'd highly recommend not listening to your own music while in story heavy parts of the game, as the in game music adds so much to the experience.

												The original NieR was an underrated gem on the 360 and PS3, and a masterpiece in my opinion. It's difficult to relate it to another game or series because there's still nothing really like it; Yoko Taro blends comedy and cruelty so well that by the time you're halfway through the game you're never sure if you're supposed to be laughing or crying, and the whole storyline is one great big beautiful tragedy where happy endings are just fleeting memories. It wasn't afraid to shift genres whenever it felt like it, suddenly turning into a sidescroller or even a text adventure at any given moment. And following Drakengard's tradition, the New Game+ was more than just an ordinary New Game+, each following playthrough revealing more and more of the game's storyline. The soundtrack is one of the best I've seen in a game, and still one of my favorites by far. The only weak link of the game was the combat, which while passable was generaly considered not great in comparison to the amazing content that surrounded it. Enter Platinum Games, for the sequel.When their involvement was first announced, I was a little worried. I love Platinum's games and I loved Revengeance, but as a Metal Gear game I thought it was a bit lacking, and so I was afraid that them heading a sequel to Nier might dilute what made the first game so great. But this is still as Nier as it gets, and Yoko Taro's genius and Platinum Games' exciting combat and cinematic flair come together in a way that works way better than I expected. The action is flashy and smooth, but the world is still just as bleak as it should be. If you haven't played the first Nier, I would recommend doing that first, not just so that you'll understand some of the references but so that you'll know what to expect. This isn't a game that treats the player like they're obligated to have a good time, and some side quests are very clearly tests of patience where whether or not you enjoy them will be determined by whether or not you're the kind of person who can laugh at the absurdity of them. If you're the kind of person who just wants to play the game to ending A and then quit, you can still have fun, but you're missing out on an enormous chunk of the story if you don't replay the game a few times (which doesn't take as long in follow-up playthroughs, because your items and sidequest progress all carry over).If you have played Nier, you may as well just buy this now assuming you didn't already have your wallet out the moment you heard ""Nier 2"". The soundtrack is just as amazing as it was last time and includes plenty of new versions of old favorites plus more, and almost everything you loved about the first game has been preserved (the fishing isn't as deep though, RIP). Aside from weapons, you can now manage your character's stats with chips that have different cost values that you slot into a grid to give various bonuses, and they're also used in a pretty interesting way in that your HUD features are also chips. If you're the sort of person who likes playing without a HUD, you can disable them and free up space for extra chips, or if you want something extra like an EXP bar or a useless fishing spot detector you can buy them and add them in for a cost. You can even unplug the OS chip that keeps your character alive, with exactly the result that you would expect.In terms of port quality, it ran fine for me throughout the game but I have heard of people with AMD cards having problems (but really I don't know if I can fault the game for that or not, since it seems like lots of games have trouble with AMD cards at launch these days) so do a bit of research before buying. I played the bulk of the game with a mouse and keyboard just fine after rebinding a couple of things, but the mouse aim doesn't work as well when the game becomes a top-down shooter so I had a gamepad ready for those parts; you can switch between the two control methods at any time seamlessly, so it was pretty easy. I don't think Nier Automata surpassed the original Nier, but that's an extremely unfair comparison, and I'm still not sure if I only feel that way because I played Nier 1 first and knew what to expect going into Automata. But both games are absolutely amazing, and should definitely be played by anyone interested in the idea of them. I don't think I'm going to enjoy a game more for the rest of the year, if not multiple years.			"

												Amazing game. The game only gets better once you complete it and finish all the endings for it and then finally the true ending.Strong intro and even stronger finish.

												Before i start off i have to say that i only played it for about an hour.So far the game seems very pleasant, controlls are easy, enemies are challenging even on normal difficulty, graphic looks very nice on high details. Action in the game is very fast, requires a bit of skill and quick reactions, 2nd boss is challenging even tho it's only the beggining of the game. Action packed games are my thing and i can say that nier meets my standard. For an easier gameplay controller is required. If i'lll find out about anything that i haven't posted yet i will update the review.			"

 NieR:Automata™ - not a perfect Game, but a true Masterpiece First of all,  this is my personal opinion - im judging the game by what i've experienced while playing it for almost 60 hours . Performance My specs are an i7 4770k combined with a GTX1070 8GB and 16GB DDR3 Ram. I'm using Win10 and the game is installed on a 4 year old HDD. In almost 60 hours I've never had a single fps-drop running at 1080p@60fps all settings maxed out and the game only crashed one time after a loading screen. I've encountered a resolution bug when playing in fullscreen mode tho, I'm gonna talk about that later in the Cons section below. My experiences with the Game  Pros Story: The story is one of the best I've ever encountered in a game with many memorable characters.Soundtrack: By far my favorite soundtrack of all time, it always fits the situations and characters perfectly and creates an awesome atmosphere.Voiceacting: I've played with japanese voices and english subtitles, they all fit their characters and sound really emotional (haven't tried english voices yet, but i will update my review once i did).Sidequests: Plenty of sidequests I never felt bored doing, many of them telling a little story.Weapons: 4 different weapon types with around 10 weapons per type, all upgradeable and having their own little story.Skills/Chips: Many different skills usable by your companion and plenty different chips to customize your gameplay as you wish.Combat: Combat animations look good and different for each weapon type, feels nice and fluent, a bit like Devil May Cry but less complex regarding combos and stuff.Bosses: plenty of different and creative bossfightsCamera: 3rd person, Top-Down, Side-Scroller - the game uses all of them and the transitions are silky smooth (for those who wonder: most of the time you are playing in 3rd person). Neutral Graphics: That's a matter of opinion - the game looks like a late PS3 game, not super bad but also not like a game from 2017, for me personally it didn't destroy the immersion or anything.World: I wouldn't call it an open-world game - it got areas you unlock when progressing through the story and quests, like the new Tomb Raider games or Darksiders, overall the map got decent size and i never encountered invisible walls blocking my way.FPS: For those who care: the game is capped at 60fps. Cons Weapontypes: Even tho there are plenty of weapons, they only differ very little to others of their type when in comes to moveset and combos (every greatsword pretty much feels the same just with a different skin).Difficulty: You can choose from easy, normal, hard or very hard and it feels like there is something missing between hard and very hard. On easy the game pretty much plays itself, good if you just want to experience the story. Normal is for the casual players that want to play by themself but without dying every 2 seconds. On very hard everything just straight up oneshots you. On hard the game starts out really hard, but once you get your chips set up and upgrade your gear the game starts to get kinda easy at some point, which is why I would have loved another difficulty between hard and very hard.PC-Controls: Overall the controls via mice and keyboard are fine, but dodging in any directions is bound to double tap of W,A,S,D which in my opinion is horrible in a game where you have to react fast and the reason why I've used a XBox-One gamepad.PC-Port: Sadly the game got a poor port from console. Many players with all different types of hardware seem to have FPS-problems, crashes, freezes and a resolution bug when playing in fullscreen mode. The only problem I had was with the resolution - when choosing 1080p and fullscreen mode, the game renders it in 900p. There are a few fixes for that, I've used borderless gaming (free version) and played in fullscreen windowed mode (Note: using borderless gaming doesen't work with NVDIA-DSR). Other than that I've had no problems with my setup. Summary NieR:Automata™ is a rollercoaster of emotions with a great story, many memorable characters and an awesome soundtrack that definetly deserved a better port and a bit more time and thought invested in it's weapon-system and overall balance of difficulty. After 60 hours I'm still blown away by it's story, characters, soundtrack and the clever usage of different camera types and game mechanics and I really hope to see another NieR game in the future. If you like RPGs and you don't mind the setting of NieR which kinda feels like an anime, then you should definetly give it a try! In my opinion it's a true masterpiece that nobody should miss and definetly my favorite game of all time. Worth every penny!			"

												TLDR: This game is amazing. Not a 10/10, but an 9/10 with a Must Play attached. Firstly i'd like to mention that i haven't played any of the prequels such as Nier: Gestalt or Drakengard 3. I had no idea what was expecting me going into this game and just bought it because i had some money to spare. I was worth every penny. Gameplay: 9/10+ pretty much standard action gameplay (somewhat like witcher 2/3)+ variation through different types of weapons and ranged combat+ the skills you equip have actual impact on what your character is capable of (counters are only available with the right      skill-chip)- the Keyboard+Mouse controll-scheme  does not  have a dedicated evade button but rather uses doubletapping       the directional keys to dodge attacks (I played it with KB+M anyways because i can't stand playing with controllers)- for newcomers it can be pretty tough the first time and takes some getting used toGraphics: 9/10+ lighting is phenomenal and conveys the athmosphere perfectly+ animations of the chracters are gorgeous- textures are fairly low quality- cutscenes slow down to 30fpsStory: 10/10+ without spoiling anything: Just Godly.     (sidenote: will take ~50 hrs to complete so bear that in mind when you think you might be done with the game)+  multiple endings, 5 actual ones and 21 ""joke"" endings. All in all, as said above the game is a Must Play. The story alone makes it worth every penny of the price. The Gameplay is a little rough on the edges with KB+M but enjoyable, though I recommend playing with a controller if you're comfortable like that.			"

												I've just finished 100% of the game, like 10 minutes ago. Just everything: the achievements, the fishing encyclopedia, weapons, side-quests...So now I think I'm able to write a proper review.NieR:Automata™ is, without doubt, one the most intense and memorable games I've ever played in my entire life. You see, I've never played its prequel, NieR, but after this outstanding title, probably I'll try to play the previous one.Everything in this game is simply memorable: the characters, the environment, the OST (which is a wonderful masterpiece)... NieR:Automata™ has become one of my favorite games of all times. It will make you feel really bad a lot of times, by the way, but the story is really worth of it.2B, 9S, A2, 6O, 21O, Pascal... :(, and many other characters are very intense and alive. Though I haven't played with the English dub, the Japanese one is marvelous and very convincing.Sure, there were some things that I did not like.One thing that has troubled me a lot was the awful RNG about the fishing mini-game. It is idiotic the time we need to waste just to get one kind of fish. Just look up at Google and see it for yourself how much time time people spent just to get a swordfish or a beetle fish. Some people spent 5, others 12, I spent 6 to 7 hours to get the swordfish and 3 to 4 hours to get the beetle fish. This RNG is absolutely insane. I mean, for those who want to complete 100% of the game (like me), this feels extremely stupid since the mini-game is NOT fun (and even if it was fun, doing the same thing over and over for all this time would still feel very bad). I almost fell asleep twice when fishing for those.So, if you intend to complete 100% of this game, be warned about this.Nevertheless, the entire experience is extremely good (although REALLY sad) and I really recommend it. You won't regret it. This game makes you think, it makes you happy (not so often), it makes you sad (a lot), and it can make you cry.NieR:Automata™ is one the best gaming experiences I've ever had so far. "

												Soooo, Nier: Automata, huh? I don't remember the last time I became so obsessed over something that I truly thought the people I usually talk to would simply leave me because I couldn't keep a conversation about things that aren't related to this game.Oh, I won't be talking about the PC Port here. There are already a lot of the true elite gamers crying all over the review section as well the discussion boards about the fact that the game won't run at 60fps all the time. Shame on you, my friendos. Playing games at 10fps is the TRUE Yoko Taro experience.This game got me really hooked. The combat is great and more often than not got me really hyped about what I was doing and that, to me, is the whole point of videogames: get you excited about them. I said this to a friend, though, and will say it here too: NieR: Automata isn't a hack and slash game, it is an action RPG. You don't have access to a large moveset and combos aren't really that important here. Most of the customization are the same as those of other games in the genre such as percentage of damage, movement speed and things like this. That said, it feels really good to go on against large quantities of enemies as well the more concise and personal one on one battles feel great too. Just don't expect the combat depth from Devil May Cry or Metal Gear Rising here.As a sucker for good stories as I am, even if the game wasn't that good gameplay wise it would pretty much earn a max rating from me from the world building and story alone.  It is really, really amazing how this title have both an interesting plot and the good gameplay to back it up. Supposing you wouldn't reach this far in my recommendation without knowing anything about the basic premise, I won't talk about it because there isn't much to talk without spoilers and I really feel that is more important to talk about how it is done.The world in NieR: Automata is empty, not colorful or lively and this is great because instead of going to the common approach to this kind of world, Automata creates an refreshing take being this somehow beautiful yet really melancholic reality with not technically great but stunning places and amazing soundtrack. It is not like the only thing in this game is sadness, it could effectively provoke laughter and other feelings as well but the thing that I will keep in my memory about this game is how everyone is trying their best but the best just isn't enough sometimes and a lot of the stories you play through just end up in absolute misery, yet, the characters keep trying to live the best they can doing what they do. Truth be told, the main theme of this game is really ""why the ♥♥♥♥ do we do what we do?"" and it is really interesting to be asked that by an entertainment such as a video game.And I must say that after going through the last of the great endings in NieR: Automata I had the weirdest smile on my face, that one that if I saw myself while smiling like that I would probably punch the mirror. This is one of the -if not THE- greatest experience I had in video games. If you have any interest in the game after reading all this, then if possible buy it because I feel that there is no way I could reflect how good I think this game is through writing.The game surely have its share of problems. I don't remember playing a game with this much invisible walls, the world map is confusing, the difficulty maybe is too low sometimes and it has an end.  That said, when you like something as much as I like this game these small things just disappear in the middle of a lot of things you like.""Oh, I really like video games"" was what I was thinking, after finishing NieR: Automata.

												So just before i begin. I have never made a review but this game is so good that i am encouraged to make a review.No serious story spoilers ahead.The writer of the story is japanese and they have a unique writing style, but i am a great fan of this top tier story writing and OMG Platinumgames has stepped up their game once again. I was a huge fan of metal gear rising and i've beat the game multiple times and the combat in NieR Automata is the best i have ever seen.The combat is almost flawless. The sole reason that it isnt flawless is because there are some performance issues in some areas. There are combos in this game but they cant be found in game and you need to look them up or find them yourself (which is unique and kind of fun to do). At this moment i have 30.2 hours in the game and i have done all the side quest but i still havent completed the game. The game ends at a certain point and you can reach the end pretty quickly if you play on easy/normal and cheese yourself trough the boss fights but when you completed the game as 2b you can play it again but this time as 9s and when you beat the story as him welp people huge suprise there is even more in store and thats where i am at right now.To this point i have used the beginning swords and i still find new combos and i still havent used spears and combat bracers a lot, but i plan to do that when i start my hard playtrough on a second save (Yeah the game is worth a second playtrough).The bullet hell sections of the game are fun and they do not occur too frequently as 2b, but when you get to 9s you can cheese yourself through the whole game by hacking everything you see and the hacking mini game is extremely repetitive and is not challenging enough for boss fights.The protagonists are amazing. 2b has a stale personality but you see that change overtime and you see how her bond with 9s develops. 9s is a playfull little boy for most of the game but in a way that doesnt get boring and the game relies on him to give the conversations some color since 2b is really formal. I cant say a lot about 2a but she's kind off an ♥♥♥ and verbally abuses pod but hey ill see, because i haven't finished the game.I can say that this game deserves a spot in my all time top 3 between MGSV and The witcher 3. 2b is waifu for lyfe  btw....

												Outside the buggy launch, this has been my personal Game of the Year.  This is a beautiful game, I found myself stopping frequently in a new area just to take screenshots and soak it in. Character animations are fluid, making even the characters themselves part of the beauty.The music and sound help make the world even better, with subtle changes depending on the source. For example, you can be running through an area and just the instrumentals are playing then as you go to another area the song will slowly fade in the vocal track and it will continue to play while you are there. As you leave the area, the vocals will fade away and finally move to the new areas song.  For the songs themselves, there isn't a bad track. All of them will illicit emotion from you and the soundtrack is well worth picking up.Combat is fast and fairly deep, allowing players to discover the intricacies as they play through the game, but not bogged down with so much complexity that novices don't have a chance to get through the game.The story is kind of a tough nut to crack. There is enough there so that people who haven't played the first game can understand what is going on, but this is a real love letter to fans of the original Nier.  I felt so much emotion when the first game was referenced, especially when a song from the first game was played in an area.  I genuinely hope that they remake the first game with the combat system from this one and release it for PC. Knowing the whole story from the first game makes all the little touches so much more impactful.So buy this game. You will not be disappointed.  Just be warned, leave your Keyboards and Mice at home. This game demands a controller.			"

												WELCOME TO YOKO TARO'S WILD RIDE+ Yoko Taro's trademark peculiar direction, with gentle swings from sardonic humor to an emotional equivalent of getting kicked in the balls. Five canon endings requiring roughly three and a half playthroughs, with twenty-one more ""joke"" endings thrown in for good measure.+ Pacing is built to keep the player engaged with something surprising continually happening throughout the course of the game, in plot as well as presentation and gameplay.+ A world with an original premise and detailed lore behind it, which opens up little by little as you get through the plot and sidequests+ Platinum Games' fast paced melee combat - button masher friendly, but with enough depth to satisfy hardcore players. The combat animations are top notch.+ Pod Programs and Plug-in Chip systems offer solid customization options. Build your character into the equivalent of Bayonetta, Jetstream Sam, a bullet grazing Touhou girl, or anything in between.+ Android butt- Routes A and B cover the same plotline from different perspectives, so a second playthrough will feel repetitive.- Poor difficulty balance - normal mode is too effortless while hard is too punishing.- Treks over the open world are a hassle before fast travel is unlocked.- Completionists may expect a good amount of grinding.+- Though the plot is largely self-contained, those who didn't play Nier/Drakengard before will miss out on a good amount of references to the previous titles, some humorous and some bittersweet.+- BEWARE OF SPOILERS. The less you know about the game, the more impact it will have.+- Quoting Yoko Taro's interview, ""The game will have a happy ending. Maybe.""Verdict:Heartily recommended. You can dodge every attack and every bullet, but you can never dodge the feels.			"

So this is gonna be a strange and short review.I can't deny that it's good but I think it's boring as heck so here's a reviewBasically I just think killing robots is boring.Gameplay design is good, graphics are good, characters are good (2B is thicc), map design is nice, the areas look really nice.Story sounds like it's incredible but I can't be bothered to go through it because I just find the gameplay aspect of the game really boring, the combat just isn't satisfying to me because the enemies are boring and the deaths are incredibly lame (they just fall over and explode pretty much).If they put some more detail into visual damage etc, I'd probably enjoy the combat, but majority of games where you fight robots seem to just have this really lame design where the robots just fall over and explode and I just can't enjoy the combat when it isn't satisfying.Apparently you will also be wearing the same outfits through the entire game, seeing as there aren't armors or anything, but there's a fair amount of weapon variety.TLDR; If you don't mind fighting incredibly similar looking robots over and over again that have incredibly lame deaths and wearing the same outfit through the entire game, I would recommend it.

												Beat it on PS4 (ending E) and I think that this is the best game that I've played in years. Plot, storytelling, gameplay, characters — everything is superb. If you have played previous Taro's games, than you would be pleased to see references to drakengard/1st nier, but it's not necessary to play those games to understand the story of Nier:Automata. If you would read every information in Nier:A, than after the end you wouldn't have any questions.What I love in Yoko Taro stories is that they are not full of stereotypes — they're fresh, unique and what's more important — INTERESTING. Yup, he's not telling you a story about ""rise of the humans"" or something like that. His characters strive to find happines yet fails severly and only cruel destiny is awaiting them. But still they aren't feel sorry or regret anything. They aren't whining about ""what ifs"" and just accept reality. Would they be able to bear it — is another question.Dark yet funny, cruel yet fascinating — this is how Yoko Taro style is looks like.Another ""pros"" of this game — neverending experimentations with gameplay. I haven't tired to play this game, because it's always changes the perspective and playing style. If you have played 1st nier you would get what I'm telling about.Overall: Best hack'n'slash of decade, 10/10.			"

												Nier:Automata is definitely the finest creation of Platinum Games,a true masterpiece thanks in no small part to the mad genius Yoko Taro of Drakengard fame who worked alongside them to create the latest installment of his series.Every aspect of this game is top notch:the combat is fast,fluid and stylish and the environments are spectacular,as for the story,well it's nothing short of superlative,Yoko Taro has outdone himself this time.As the labor of love of one of the best game developers and one of the best game directors around,This game is highly raccomanded to everyone.

												This game is amazing, but it does have its flaws. My favorite part about playing is finding a dead body from another player and wondering how they could die in a place like this, only to die 3 min later lol :-: (I'm playing on the hard difficulty). The graphics are decent but not spectacular. A budget pc could run this no problem. The locked 60fps in game and 30fps cutseens is kind of irritating. The combat takes some getting used to, but once you get the hang of it, you'll feel like the sexy android bad ♥♥♥ you've always wanted to be.My only real compaint is the minimap and the menus map.

												I tried multiple times to get through the first mission. The problem is: there is a bug that occurs when using sword attacks. The special fx will cause your game to crash (white screen of death). Unless this is fixed, I can't recommend the game as much as I love Platinum.The game itself is probably really really good (which is why I bought it) but the port just is pretty bad. The one thing Radeon owners can do is install a driver from 2016 (the one before the ReLive update). The game won't crash anymore but performance will be much worse (as well as in other games, as the driver improvements of the ReLive drivers have been great).If those gamebreaking technical issues are fixed, I will come update this review. But for now: don't buy this game. Buy Metal Gear Rising Revengeance instead if you want refined Platinum gameplay on the PC or get some other JRPG if you're looking for one.			"

												I should start by saying that this is a review purely of the technical issues that currently plague this game, not the content of the game itself. I don't feel that I've been able to get far enough into the game to thoroughly review its story or gameplay, so I'll leave that to other reviewers. To clarify, this review probably doesn't apply to you if:1. Your PC well exceeds the recommended specs listed on the store page, and2. You own some sort of two-stick controller which you are able to use on your PCThe sole reason that this review is a ""Do Not Recommend"" is as a warning to potential buyers to research VERY carefully before making this purchase. There are MANY issues that players are having right now, including myself, which make the game effectively unplayable.First, do not even consider purchasing this game unless your GPU is sufficiently powerful to run the game at a solid 60 FPS on the settings you choose, with NO dips whatsoever. For some absurd reason, the game compensates for a framerate below the 60 FPS cap by actually slowing down the game, so that the same amount of time passes between frames regardless of how long it takes to render them. This means that, if you can't put out a solid 60 FPS, your game will literally be running in slow-motion. If you are on a laptop, or if you are on a desktop that hasn't had its GPU upgraded in the past few years, you will NOT be able to run this game playably in its current state.Second, do not even attempt to play this game with keyboard and mouse; it is effectively impossible, and certain sequences will be beyond frustrating to complete with the game's insanely broken K&M controls. The game naively treats your mouse as an analogue stick, meaning that as soon as you stop moving it, your aim snaps back to the direction your character is facing. This means that you essentially have to use only WASD to aim, and the mouse is literally useless - a control scheme which is so mindbogglingly stupid that I have a hard time believing anyone at SquareENIX or Platinum Games ever tried playing this game with K&M controls, despite the game claiming to support it.That said, I don't want to make it appear that I am ""trashing"" this game. From everything that I've seen, it seems like an absolutely lovely game, and I am sorely disappointed that I am unable to play it in an enjoyable way. If you own a console that this game is offered on, or have a sufficiently beastly PC and own a peripheral controller, give it a shot. I did enjoy the brief portion of it that I was able to barely stumble through, and reviews of the game's story have been absolutely sparkling. Just be aware that this game was clearly never intended for PC, and almost zero effort was put into porting it in a playable way. If you're okay with that, and you have the right setup to be able to play it, then by all means, do.			"

												""Beautiful in ways that can't be measured in polygons or textures"" is a phrase I'd use to describe this game. For a game that looks last-gen it manages to bleed aesthetic and atmosphere. Visual motifs are often used as symbolism and I think that may go unappreciated between the panty shots and the robots pantomiming a reproductive act that they barely understand. Even those can serve as a catalyst for some introspection on the player's part. Without ruining too much let's say the bizarre and unpredictable nature of the game and its characters is executed extremely well.It's important to know that the real meat of this game doesn't get served until after the credits roll for the first time. A second playthrough has you playing as another character with an entirely different opening sequence. New enemies are introduced, old enemies are found in greater numbers, and tougher enemies will spawn in places they hadn't before. The best examples of this I can not specify because it would surely ruin the surprise of encountering them when you hadn't previously.The combat is mostly standard Platinum affair with some things to change it up from time to time like perspective shifts, combat minigames, and so on. The game is fun to play and likes to dip into post-humanism and existentialism from time to time, but don't let that dissuade you. No matter how dark the narrative gets there's always exposed panties somewhere.			"

												I was originalyl going to write a long review, but in doing so I would use a lot of time I could potentially spend playing this game, so I made a short one instead.I bought this game not knowing what to expect, except from a good soundtrack. I ended up getting waaay more than I was expecting:・An amazing soundtrack that kept geting better untill the end.・Combat that was actually fun and not too complicated for my simple mind. (I don't really play hack 'n slashes)・Great characters. (Gotta love 2B's secret)・Graphics that, while they weren't great, fit in with the game itself.・Did I mention the incredible soundtrack?・Interesting upgrade system.・Rebindable controller controls. (It actually is possible)・A really well implemented sidescroll/top-down mechanic.The game really just looks very cool.Of course not everything was perfect:・Quite terrible performance on GPUs that aren't next-gen:    - ~50-55fps on lowest graphics settings, on a double GTX770. (The game doesn't appear to be well-optimised for SLI)    - On higher graphics settings, the fps drop wasn't that substantial (only ~20 or so difference between lowest and highest), but the overall framerate wasn't great.・Some glitchy moments (1080p fullscreen not working correctly, the game sometimes messing up, forcing me to restart)・Reverts to windowed on every alt+tab.Despite this, a really great game, and definitely reccomended.9.2/10 "

												It's no doubt that the PC port for Nier:Automata has had a rocky start with many players experiencing different kinds of problems. Though I can only talk about what I have experienced. I don't have a perfectly running game but it has been very playable for me. I don't write reviews often, but here goes :)Pros:- The soundtrack is wonderful and works with the beautiful graphics to immerse you in the world.- The graphics. Every new place I discover I am in awe at how beautiful it is, and when I come back to same place, I'm still  in awe. They're stunning.- Open world.- The story, hooks you right from the beginning and your curiosity will make you want to play more.- The gameplay. If you've watched any gameplay of the game you will have got a sense of what the combat is like in the game.All in all it's a fluid hack and slash, action RPG game which has both a good story and gameplay.The cons:- The fullscreen bug. As you've probably heard, fullscreening the game won't work and there doesn't seem to be a fix other than to use a third party program to put it in windowed borderless. Hopefully this will be fixed soon.- Messing around with the texture filtering and anti-aliasing options casues the screen to turn black, cyan and all sorts of other screens. But the game doesn't freeze, so if you can remember what you're currently selecting, you can keep messing with it to get rid of the coloured screens.- For me, the 60fps lock on the game is a con as it would've been even better without it.- Same goes for the 30fps lock in the cutscenes. It feels very laggy in cutscenes.- Various settings also reset when I relaunch the game including controls, camera positions, graphics.- The game is intended to be played on a controller. Though it's still somewhat playable on keyboard, you'll most likely enjoy yourself more if you played on a controller.These are the only problems I've had playing the game. But there are still people who can't run the game properly. So yes, this is a bad port. Not for me, but could be for you. I'd say wait it out and see if the issues get fixed.I wouldn't say that I have a high end PC what so ever. I run with an AMD R9 390, i7-2600 and 8gbs RAM. I can run the game at max settings and still have pretty much constant 60 fps (55 - 60). it only dips a little (50-55) when I enter a new area but then goes back to 60 after it's finished loading the world around you, which takes like 3 seconds.So yeah, the game is very much playable for me and I'm thoroughly enjoying it. The only thing I really notice is the fullscreen bug. I don't even use a program to fix it. I just play the game in windowed 1920x1080.EDIT: The settings resetting has somehow fixed itself. On bootup today, they've retained what they were on last night. "

												As hard as it was, I had to stop playing for a second to recommend this game to you guys.This game is alot of fun, gameplay is smooth and satisfying, THE ANIMATIONS ARE SUPERB! graphics are not the best you ever seen but still looks good most of the time.Now, you can play this game with keyboard and mouse and u can also customize the keys but I found this game to be much more enjoyable with a controller (I play dark souls and ds3 with a keyboard).This game works perfectly fine, no issues.When I first started playing I was confused for the first 40 mins or so but once u figure out how things work you can't put it down. JOIN THE HYPE AND BUY THE GAME! :D			"

												Nier Automata is the first game by Yoko Taro that I've played... and now, bad gameplay or no, I want to play them all.Pros:-The story is amazing. Subquests build upon themes, grow the world, it's just... great.-The world is really immersive. You'll do some backtracking, but it adds, twists, so much each time.-The characters are amazing. While I tended to find most NPCs more intriguing in many ways than the protags, this was not bad as it meant you wanted to see more of the world, desperately.-If you like platinum's gameplay, but feel the slowdown effect is incredibly boring, it's not inherently a part.-Lots of content. A lot. Like hours. I spent over 50 hours 100%ing it--ignore my achievements, I had to play offline.-You will cry a lot.Cons:-The camera is sometimes garbage, tugging hard to one direction. Lock on is a must, making hard mode a no go.-This is not optimized for PC, or lower systems. at all.-You will need to use Borderless Gaming to play fullscreen, so keep note of this, unless you have a low res monitor-Seems to have a problem the longer you play, possibly a memory leak? A reboot seems needed to fix it on 2 computers.-You will cry a lot.I recommend it. A lot. I could say more, but I don't WANT to. You want to go into this not knowing much.Play this! :D			"

												""Beautiful in ways that can't be measured in polygons or textures"" is a phrase I'd use to describe this game. For a game that looks last-gen it manages to bleed aesthetic and atmosphere. Visual motifs are often used as symbolism and I think that may go unappreciated between the panty shots and the robots pantomiming a reproductive act that they barely understand. Even those can serve as a catalyst for some introspection on the player's part. Without ruining too much let's say the bizarre and unpredictable nature of the game and its characters is executed extremely well.It's important to know that the real meat of this game doesn't get served until after the credits roll for the first time. A second playthrough has you playing as another character with an entirely different opening sequence. New enemies are introduced, old enemies are found in greater numbers, and tougher enemies will spawn in places they hadn't before. The best examples of this I can not specify because it would surely ruin the surprise of encountering them when you hadn't previously.The combat is mostly standard Platinum affair with some things to change it up from time to time like perspective shifts, combat minigames, and so on. The game is fun to play and likes to dip into post-humanism and existentialism from time to time, but don't let that dissuade you. No matter how dark the narrative gets there's always exposed panties somewhere.			"

												Here we have NieR: Automata. A Yoko Taro game.While the prologue is a mish-mash of genres from shoot 'em up, top-down, sideview, and then your normal third person mode. It's actually a solid game. Though, beware of prologue on hard mode as there are no save points in the prologue. So one death/mistake makes you restart that whole segment. A trial by fire segment.Once you get past that though, you get to explore the barren wasteland of the world that is now taken over by robots and who knows whatever else happened to it after the 10,000+ years that past for Earth. Gameplay is pretty solid on a controller. Keyboard and Mouse is only friendly in third person mode, minus the dedicated dodge/run button controller has. (KBM has to double tap a direction for the dodge/run).I haven't completed the game yet, but it's actually been really fun so far if you like a post-apocalyptic world filled with humanoid androids and a possible ♥♥♥♥ery story by Yoko Taro.ALSO, A MAJOR NOTE IN REGARDS TO PERFORMANCE. The game's AA is actual MSAA (Multisample Anti-aliasing). So it's extremely taxing on performance if you're wondering why the game may run badly on your machine. The alternative is to just let the built-in shader AA from Ambient Occlusion do the AA instead for more performance.			"

												“Story and gameplay are not the most important thing. I design games and write stories, but my goal is to cause an emotional stir inside the players' brain. “ – Yoko Taro, Director of Drakengard, Nier and Nier AutomataYou will laugh, you will experience disappointment, you will have your heart broken, you will get angry, and then you will have your heart broken again, you will do some introspection, and then at last, you might cry. You might hate the characters, or you might sympathize with their shortcomings. In the end, you will feel for them, and feel sad or happy at their eventual fate.This game does not have a single human being. And yet I see myself in the androids and machines that are supposed to be devoid of emotions and humanity. I see my foolishness and stubbornness. I also see my persistence and good will. contrary to the cover art and various fan art, this story is not about an anime waifu girl and a naïve boy on an adventure and happily ever after, but about the struggle of life, about humanity, about religion, about philosophy, but all incorporated into a consistent story in an established universe, and presented to you without any presumption. If you like a good story and good writing, if you like humor, if you like RPG, if you want to feel something real while playing, you owe it to yourself to play this masterpiece.  "

												Alright, time for my in depth review.NieR: Automata delivers really fluid gameplay with elements of Danmaku, Action RPG, Hack and Slash 2D Platforming in certain areas and very fast gameplay to add it all together. The game is brilliant and it has a lot of Android butts :^)NieR offers a lot of game time, the 36 hours I have on record is just me getting to the True Ending of NieR, that doesn't include side quests and searching for the weapons and Pod Programs.Spoiler? Alert: The very end of Route E offered the hardest decision ever imaginablePrepare for a roller coaster of emotions, you may be able to dodge bullets, but you can't dodge the feelings.Also, A2 is best Android, fight me.The Pros outweigh the Cons... TBH, I don't have any Cons for this game, it's a 10/10 game in my books and I'll continue to play it.			"

Hopefully the full screen and fps issues will be fixed at somepoint but for release it is playable if you dont mind window mode and some fps drops. The game itself is solid, glad it had a PC release also despite the minor issues. Heres a video of some gameplay including a cutscene and the true fate of grimoire weiss (non canon)

												Wow.... this game is something else. It is one of the best games I've ever played. The story is great with it's amazing writing, surprising depth, and humor that lands every time. The gameplay is fantastic. Not only is it a solid hack and slash jrpg but it also has 2d side scroller and twin stick shooter elements that spice it up enough to keep everything moving and new without being overused or making the game feel repetitive. The visuals are out of this world, you really feel immersed in the setting with the characters. The audio and music is second to none. All of those combined easily makes the price point of $60 worth it for this game. My only two cons with this game are first right now I am forced to play in windowed mode waiting for a patch for fullscreens and second they​ are not selling the soundtrack on steam. This game is easily my GOTY of 2017. I would highly recommend it to anyone. 10/10			"

												NieR:Automata... This Game is a Masterpiece with an unbeatable Gameplay, amazing/unique Story and Characters combined with some good looking Graphics and for me one of THE Games of 2017 :)  (Detailed informations below after the overall rating)  My Rating:   Gameplay 10/10   Soundtrack: 10/10   Graphics: 8/10   Story: 10/10 Gameplay:RPG Elements:In my opinion... The Gameplay is the biggest Reason why you should get this Game. You have access to 4 different Weapon types, each with his own fighting style and every Weapon type has multiple Weapons that provides multiple different special Effects if you upgrade them! Like Attackspeed+, Crit or Stun chance & many more. In addition you will have access to multiple Pods (flying companions)! Each Pod brings his own ranged Weapon type like a Gatling or Rocket launcher for example. The Pod can also equip a special Ability for you. And if this isn't enough... you will come across Computer Chips that will allow you to customize 2B's Perks and Abilities. You can unlock Abilties like beeing immortal for 0,5s after recieving damage or reflecting x% damage. Or you increase your health, defense, attack, movespeed or any other stats. The possibilities are huge... You can even change the hud with these Chips. The Battles:The Enemys and Battles will most likely never be the same. As you progress through the game every Enemy unit will provide some surprises for you. Like new Equipment, Weapons or even new fighting styles. And you have to be beware of that you will be forced to fight your Enemys not only in 3rd person... Some Locations and espacially some Bosses will force you to fight in different perspectives. So you will suddenly find yourself in a side-scroller or some sort of top-down Shooter... it feels like time-traveling through the History of Gaming while you still play NieR:Automata xD It's just amazing.Soundtrack: I think its some sort of personal taste :) In my opinion the music is well chosen and fits perfectly to every location and situation in the game.Graphics:The Graphics are very good overall. The Characters and Enemys look amazing. There are also some very stunning Places in the Game often combined with some very nice Effects. The Game is full of special Effects and makes the Battle feel even more exciting and challenging. Anyway... There have been better looking Games already and some Textures/Objects in the open World could be classified as some sort of defective Appearance. But in my opinion NieR:Automata still looks better then the Majority of Games out there at the moment.Story:In NieR:Automata you slip into the Role of 2B an Android that is designed for battle accompanied by the Android 9S some Scout type Android. Like many other Androids you have the Mission to occupy the earth back for the Humans that have been defeated and nearly wiped out by a giant Machine Army that has been send by Aliens long time ago. But things aren't that simple. Very soon you will come across many in peace living Machines who don't want to fight... While your Orders are strict and don't allow you to show mercy. The Developers surely knew how to make the Players feel insecure about their Decisions. And you have to make many Decisions that should be well chosen in view of 26 possible Endings. Thats all i will tell you :) I don't want to spoil anything of this amazing Story. Hint: I would advice you to play this Game with a Controller. Maybe it's just me... But it was much harder for me to dodge the Enemy's attacks with the Keyboard.			"

												A frustrating introduction gives way to an unforgettable conclusion. This game has the best synergy I've ever seen between the themes, presentation, story, and gameplay in a video game. In fact, I don't think I've ever seen another piece of entertainment that was so incredibly dense and interwoven with as many unique aspects tying back around to create a whole greater than the sum of the parts while using the medium its presented in to the fullest. The story, while it starts out cliched (as cliched as a post post-apocalypse can be), gets constantly expanded and amended adding layer and layer of depth. Sure, the initial ""what makes a human a human"" theme isn't the most unique one to center the initial story around, but the way that the game answers that question, and has the player answer that question, is incredible. That isn't to say that's the only theme throughout either. Over the course of this journey you'll be presented with many themes regarding religion, family, culture, sexuality, transhumanism, and existentialism. That being said many of those themes don't have a lot of depth or discussion, are a little too spelled out (the main character's name is even 2B) at times. or they themselves act as supplementary material to the true main theme of the game. Cycles. Repetition. Unfortunately, repetition in gameplay gets boring (even if it's done on purpose for thematic reasons), and as much as I admire the developer for sticking so firmly to tying storytelling and gameplay together, even at the detriment to the player, there's just a little too much sacrifice on the player's end than is good for it.The gameplay is best described as a mixture of Dark Souls and Devil May Cry/Bayonetta with a dash of Touhou and Astebreed. Like Dark Souls you're not given any combo list instead opting for fairly simple mechanics that stay constant throughout the journey. Unlike Dark Souls, however, your character is incredibly agile weaving in and out of combat with lightning quick dodges, launchers, ranged attacks, and specials. It's an impeccably well animated visual delight to watch play out. There are a ton of side quests that all provide fantastic world building, and the overworld itself, while small, is wonderfully designed rewarding players who explore with lots of secrets and quick alternative routes to navigate. To top this off there's a really unique upgrade system where you slot computer chips of varying point values dropped from enemies into yourself for basic functions and buffs. If you want you can individually disable aspects of your user interface to free up some upgrade room and opt for more buffs instead. These chips can also be fused together to provide higher quality buffs as well. Collecting high level chips, combining them, and trying these out is a lot of fun.Please know that once you see the credits the first time that you're only about 30% done with the game. There's a lot more left.Also, the soundtrack is incredible. If nothing else, go listen to the OST on YouTube during some free time.Where are the issues in this game then?First, the opening level. Don't try it on hard. Start on Normal, or Easy if you're having difficulty, then switch to the harder difficulty after you save. There is no checkpoint system present in the introduction and if you fail or if the game crashes you have to do the whole intro again. It's about 15-30 minutes depending on how fast you go. If you stay on hard you could potentially waste well over two hours repeating the same cycle over which would pave the way for an unsatisfying experience. Don't do that to yourself unless you really want to and are prepared to waste that much time doing the same thing.Second, the combat. It is designed to be accessible to people from all skill levels. This means there isn't a ton of depth to it, but that doesn't mean there's none. It's simply not a lot especially when you consider this comes from the developer of Metal Gear Rising. There's a lot of weapons, but most behave very similar. There's a lot of combos available and hotswapping of weapon sets to allow complex mixups, but almost no enemies that warrant using any of that on (many enemies aren't even hostile unless you initiate the fight) leaving most players to set into a rhythm of using the same weapons and pods throughout the whole game. There is some variety added to the mechanics eventually which spice the gameplay up later on, but that mechanic becomes repetitive very quickly. Again, all of this is very deliberate and ties back into the themes even if it is detrimental to the long term gameplay.Third, the difficulty modes. Because of the above accessibility they attempted to make the difficulties vary wildly. On Hard most things one shot you. On Very Hard everything one shots you. This, along with the death system, encourages a more reserved and distance based approach which leads to the player repeating the same strategies without mixing it up. Normal mode is balanced for people who are new to action games it seems, but still want some minor challenge. The issue with this mode is the fact you can have 99 of all healing and buffs and can consume them in a pause menu. Easy mode allows you to equip items that lets the game play itself for those who want nothing to do with the combat. This breakdown leaves Hard and Very hard feeling unfair while Normal and Easy end up being way too easy with no decent middle ground.Finally, the death system. On death you leave a corpse of yourself with all experience since your last save and all equipped upgrade chips. Dying again before picking that up means you lose them forever. There's two reasons this is a heavily flawed system. First, those chips are all random drops from enemies and can be very difficult to find. Losing them can mean losing time you spent grinding and fusing them together. Since people don't like having things they've invested time into vanish into thin air they will be abusing the mechanics surrounding it. Namely, the fact you can save before you leave to go pick your corpse up and reload if you die voiding the whole penalty assuming you want to spend the time to retry. Second, those buffs are fairly important on Hard/Very Hard and you don't want to lose them, or die in a place that's hard to pick them back up, which in turn reinforces the repetitive gameplay mentioned before.Despite all this the game still makes my top 10 of all time. Try this out if you can. Even if you find that the gameplay becomes monotonous, at the very least the uniqueness of the whole package should make it worth the purchase and time investment by the end. Aside from that it's a game the market desperately needs to be supported.Pros:Incredible soundtrackFlashy combatGreat animationFun upgrade systemBrilliant set piecesGreat pacingThe characters/story/themes are all top notchSide quests that add meaning to the worldInteresting and unique environmentTons of replayabilityControl remapping on gamepadCons:The combatThe dialogue ranges from incredible to basic anime clichesThe performance is unexpectedly poorThe death system is pointlessThe intro level is a bore and a choreThe difficulty modes "

												Full Review: http://fg-2.com/2017/03/22/review-nierautomata/Overall this is one of my favorite games of all time if not my favorite. The experience I got playing this filled me with joy, sadness, excitement, anger, anxiousness and lifted spirits. You grow to appreciate the trouble of the character's and the world they are in. The narrative telling by Yoko Taro is absolutely incredible and can only be accomplished in gaming medium. You want proof that games are art here is exhibit A. Everything about this game is incredible, the world, the character's, the story, the gameplay, the soundtrack, the visual aesthetics. This will go down as one of the best games of 2017 and even possibly on the best games of all time. Story – 10Gameplay – 10Visual – 8Audio – 10Fun – 10Value – 10			"

												Nier Automata is the first game by Yoko Taro that I've played... and now, bad gameplay or no, I want to play them all.Pros:-The story is amazing. Subquests build upon themes, grow the world, it's just... great.-The world is really immersive. You'll do some backtracking, but it adds, twists, so much each time.-The characters are amazing. While I tended to find most NPCs more intriguing in many ways than the protags, this was not bad as it meant you wanted to see more of the world, desperately.-If you like platinum's gameplay, but feel the slowdown effect is incredibly boring, it's not inherently a part.-Lots of content. A lot. Like hours. I spent over 50 hours 100%ing it--ignore my achievements, I had to play offline.-You will cry a lot.Cons:-The camera is sometimes garbage, tugging hard to one direction. Lock on is a must, making hard mode a no go.-This is not optimized for PC, or lower systems. at all.-You will need to use Borderless Gaming to play fullscreen, so keep note of this, unless you have a low res monitor-Seems to have a problem the longer you play, possibly a memory leak? A reboot seems needed to fix it on 2 computers.-You will cry a lot.I recommend it. A lot. I could say more, but I don't WANT to. You want to go into this not knowing much.Play this! :D			"

												Here we have NieR: Automata. A Yoko Taro game.While the prologue is a mish-mash of genres from shoot 'em up, top-down, sideview, and then your normal third person mode. It's actually a solid game. Though, beware of prologue on hard mode as there are no save points in the prologue. So one death/mistake makes you restart that whole segment. A trial by fire segment.Once you get past that though, you get to explore the barren wasteland of the world that is now taken over by robots and who knows whatever else happened to it after the 10,000+ years that past for Earth. Gameplay is pretty solid on a controller. Keyboard and Mouse is only friendly in third person mode, minus the dedicated dodge/run button controller has. (KBM has to double tap a direction for the dodge/run).I haven't completed the game yet, but it's actually been really fun so far if you like a post-apocalyptic world filled with humanoid androids and a possible ♥♥♥♥ery story by Yoko Taro.ALSO, A MAJOR NOTE IN REGARDS TO PERFORMANCE. The game's AA is actual MSAA (Multisample Anti-aliasing). So it's extremely taxing on performance if you're wondering why the game may run badly on your machine. The alternative is to just let the built-in shader AA from Ambient Occlusion do the AA instead for more performance.			"

												""Beautiful in ways that can't be measured in polygons or textures"" is a phrase I'd use to describe this game. For a game that looks last-gen it manages to bleed aesthetic and atmosphere. Visual motifs are often used as symbolism and I think that may go unappreciated between the panty shots and the robots pantomiming a reproductive act that they barely understand. Even those can serve as a catalyst for some introspection on the player's part. Without ruining too much let's say the bizarre and unpredictable nature of the game and its characters is executed extremely well.It's important to know that the real meat of this game doesn't get served until after the credits roll for the first time. A second playthrough has you playing as another character with an entirely different opening sequence. New enemies are introduced, old enemies are found in greater numbers, and tougher enemies will spawn in places they hadn't before. The best examples of this I can not specify because it would surely ruin the surprise of encountering them when you hadn't previously.The combat is mostly standard Platinum affair with some things to change it up from time to time like perspective shifts, combat minigames, and so on. The game is fun to play and likes to dip into post-humanism and existentialism from time to time, but don't let that dissuade you. No matter how dark the narrative gets there's always exposed panties somewhere.			"

												NieR: Automata is not perfect, but there is something strange about this game! I don`t know how truly describe the way I felt about it, but I`ll try. This game gives you strange vibes of nostalgia, feeling that can be described like your first love or affection, something that resembles a great joy of just playing this game!Story: Well... i didn`t finish the game, but I`ll say that the story in Nier is not for everyone. At first you don`t need to play the original Nier to enjoy the plot of Automata, but it`s always nice to know the lore and background of the game! So I suggest you watch this video: Lore summary - From Drakengard to NieR Automata and read wikia for additional knowledge. The plot is ummm... weird? Yeah, that`s the best way to portray it. Years and years after the events of original Nier, humanity was on verge of total annihilation because of aliens. During the 14th Machine Armament War, humans are near extinction. With the invasion of the “Living Machines”, humanity had no choice but to abandon the planet, taking refuge upon the Moon. Their only hope lie in an armada of specially configured androids called “YoRHa”. Programmed with human emotions and feelings, they descend upon the surface of the planet to combat the ceaseless onslaught of the Machines. (How ""original"" you may say, but that`s why i suggested you to learn about the lore of Drakengard and original Nier!). So after three years after these events, our protagonist 2B supported by 9S, is sent to the Factory to eliminate their target! - And that kids, is how I met my waifu! Synopsis is weird, but intriguing and like I said not everyones`s gonna like this kind of story! But if you`re a fan of shounen anime or ""typical"" japanese story telling, you`ll love it!Gameplay: One of the most strongest points of the game. Platinum knows how to make sh*t right, so you know exactly that you`ll never get tired of killing robots! NieR Automata has not only a great slashing aspect, but also an RPG. Side quests, loot, open but deserted world, upgrading features and so on. As far as I can say, it`s fun to play!  Music: OMG... my ears... they are... cuuuuuming! Each compostion, each melody gives you an eargasm and goosebumps! Each location has it`s own theme and boss fights are freaking epic! It`s ""Platinum"" quality, baby!Graphics: ""These are ps2 graphics, and you`re asking me to have gtx 980 to play 60fps for 1080p? Ohhh... ♥♥♥ U!""The game is obviously past-gen, but it`s not hideous! It`s just... ok~! Some textures were realy bad, especially on buildings, but it`s not such a big deal! Overall it`s a good looking game with good animations. Port is not the worst, but could have been done better!Overall NieR Automata is a strange game (in good sense). After 7 hours of playing, I really enjoyed the combat, music, setting and charm of Nier`s world! Like I said earlier, Nier gave me strange vibes of nostalgia and happiness. Even though it`s not a perfect game, but it`s NEAR to be called perfect!After finishing this game, I`m sure about one thing! That NieR Automata will always have a special place in my heart just for feeling a kid`s joy of playing video game!9.5/10Whom am I kidding? I just bought this game becuase of 2B`s t h i c c ♥♥♥! "

												Game is so good I played through it in one sitting. No idea why other's are having trouble even playing it, I launched it and began playing with it just fine, didn't change anything besides contrast, volume and bindings. I did notice that the game dropped frames a few times but it's not like it mattered, it's not like it was game breaking.Overall:Pretty great story on the surface but once you actually get into the story you'll love it (related to spoiler below)Combat is amazingly executed. You switch from multiple perspectives such as top down, side scrolling and in some cases wing suit combat. The combat may seem like a simple spam dodge but at later parts of the game it becomes crucial to time them.I enjoyed exploring the world so much that I spent a couple of hours just going through and searching almost every nook and cranny before progressing the story. Probably best to progress like mid way through the game before you start searching this detailed, you'll still have access to all the areas.Fast travel is by far the worst part of the game because it takes too long. At some points I figured it was actually faster for me to just travel to a location than to fast travel.Music was amazing, it really set the mood for fighting areas and for the scenery it wanted to potray After 20 long hours I thought I beat the game,I felt lilke it was a little short because there was a lot of questions that were unasnwered  but (spoiler)  nope, didn't beat the game. Once you ""beat"" the game you just load your game save and play through the perspective of others such as 9s. Turns out, there is TONS more story left, even after these 20 hours9.5/10 only because i disliked the loading screen			"

												I've barely started yet but I can already say that this is a beautiful masterpiece. It has stunning art direction comparable to a small indie game crafted out of love like INSIDE for example. It's got the big budget beautiful soundtrack courtesy of Square Enix. The combat is fluid and crisp like you would expect from a Platinum game. And it has amazingly integrated bullet hell style combat both in a ship and on foot. The camera will dynamically switch around as you progress through areas sometimes turning the game into a 2D sidescroller, or top down combined with the afformentioned bullet hell style. You'll also be walking around and talking to folks which feels very JRPGish which is a huge turn on for me. There is just so many wonderful ideas at play in this game. It borrows and integrates aspects from game styles that I love and transforms them into something that feels fresh and amazing to behold.Please patch this port up it could use a bit of work though. Otherwise I'm blown away, it's too good.			"

												Pre-review information:I've never played a game in thie universe, or by this publisher, before.I've never played a spectacle fighter (or whatever this game is) before.I'm playing on Normal mode, largely using a controller.PC parts at end of review.Now, the meat of things:OverviewNieR:Automata is a hard game to describe. It regularly switches primary camera angles, and occasionally it gets bored and completely switches genres. You will most definitely want a controller. I use an old XBox USB model, which works wonderfully.The game could do a better job of explaining itself in the early hour. I've been avoiding online resources because I want to approach it unspoiled, and it took me an embarrassing amount of time to realize that there is a sprint function. (Your dodge key is the toggle, by the way.) Don't expect too much handholding, even when it comes to controls. The beginning of the game kits you out with a fairly heavily-upgraded character to make things easier, but it then fails to inform you that it's not making things easier anymore when it takes those upgrades away. Minor quibble, but one that got me my first death.CombatBecause this is what you care about. You're playing a spectacle fighter, for God's sake.Combat is your standard Light Attack/Heavy Attack, with a spammable ranged attack that doesn't interrupt other things, so you can spin merrily around the fight pumping bullets into one enemy and slicing another to bits. Expect to be dodge-dashing a lot, since you don't start out with a whole lot of health to play with. Enemies are leveled, although if you're dodge-dashing like you should be, the only difference between a level 5 enemy and a level 30 enemy is the number of hits it will take to kill it. This is where my biggest problem with NieR:A's combat comes to light: Some enemies, especially bosses, feel like sponges. Upgrading weapons is a bit of a chore (unless I'm just bad at resource-gathering) and the personal upgrades you can get for your character are on the order of 10% extra damage.So how do you deal with slightly-too-spongy enemies? You RIPOSTE! You riposte EVERYTHING! You'll riposte when a ten-foot-tall metal monster steps on your toe. You'll riposte when a wheel excavator slams onto your head. Your enemy riposted your hit? RIPOSTE HIS RIPOSTE. You'll get a big damage bonus for riposting, and you'll pull off some awesome combos in the process, and it'll feel awesome.And that's my overall impression of the combat: It's FUN. It might take a bit too long to get through some bosses, and projectile enemies might be annoying (can't riposte a bullet), but I never found myself frustrated by it because that longer combat is still engaging enough to enjoy.PlotThere's a plot happening, and, 12 hours in, I can proudly say I was wrong when I tried to guess THE TWIST, but is there another TWIST in store for me? No idea. I don't even know how far I am into the story. It's impossible to predict, and nothing ever goes the way you'd expect it to. Those are both positive qualities for me, so I enjoy it.I suppose English VO work should get a mention in this section. It seems to be pretty good so far, pretty well translated and voiced. Characters are voiced inconsistently, though, and I remember one particular conversation where every line of dialogue existed in a text box, then the last exchange was fully-voiced. Minor quibbles, nothing major to note.LooksThe game looks damn good on minimum settings, which is how I run it. Chracter models aren't huge on the screen, so any lack of detail there isn't noticeable, and weapon effects look awesome on Low. Okay, I'm sorry, I have to:The protagonist's posterior is a prominent feature on the screen in most of the 3D camera angles. Very prominent. The short flared skirt (which looks ridiculous in my opinion, but hey, Japan) coupled with the movement animations and cloth physics mean that you will be staring at 2B's mostly-bare butt for a large amount of your playtime.So, you know, there's that. PerformanceMy PC is an aging beast, and was struggling to stay above 20 FPS in 1080p resolution. So, I committed the cardinal sin of PC gaming and scaled down NieR to run at 1366x768 in a window. It now stays at a flawless 60. Constantly. I do not know if this is a bug with 1080p, or if that's just what my poor computer needed, but it works. I've heard complaints about fullscreen bugs, but I'm not in a position to experience them.Something that struck me (or failed to strike me, I should say) is the complete lack of loading screens. It's a fairly large world you can explore, and at no point will it stop you to load the next area (unless you've never been there before, then you'll get a cinematic opener). Loading screens will occur on fast travel, on death, and after cutscenes. They were fairly quick, and this game is not loaded onto an SSD.This game is capped at 60 FPS during gameplay and 30 FPS during some cinematics.Conclusion/TLDRI started playing this game at 4pm today with the intention of seeing if I liked it enougha fter 2 hours to keep it.It is now 4:53AM, and I didn't find myself bored at any point in the intervening time. That gets a solid recommendation in my book.PC Stats:Intel Core i7 870 @ 2.93GHzEVGA GTX 750TI 2GBWindows 7 x6416GB RAM			"

												So far, I've had fun with this game. That does not mean every feature is good. I think this game does an amazing job at most things, but the things it doesn't it is awful at doing. This is my experience 6 hours into the game.Good things:-Characters are not 2d, and show emotion. The dialogue is pretty well written, and I enjoy how the characters passively talk. 2B and 9S talking passively is always interesting, and while it doesn't always further the character developement, it shows the how the characters foil eachother.-This game is amazing at being a 3d bullet hell game. It does an amazing job of making it feel good to dodge and play around the enemies attacks.-The world is beautiful, the graphics could have been better, but that doesn't mean the world isn't beautiful. -This game explains death. Its gives a good explanation of how death doesnt actually end the game.-Weapon variety. The weapons in this game have synergies in power attacks, so they actually work in conjunction. -The game is good at seamlessly transitioning from top down, to sidescroller, to 3d, where you notice it, but it doesnt feel like its forcing you into it.-The controls just feel nice. I know this is bad to put in a review but combat feels fluid and works. One of my major gripes though is shown mainly in the combat.-The music is absolutely stunning and fits the situations it comes in at. I wish they sold the soundtrack.Ok things:-This game has customization I don't understand. It doesn't do a good job of explaining it, but it is deep so I mean good and bad.-The buttons on the normal controller setup are weird, but seem the best out of the options.-Saving works, and it makes sense why they did saving this way, but I feel it restricts the player a bit too much.Bad things:-Now this is going to sound weird, but it is literally impossible to play this game without looking up the main characters skirt. This is not only because of the physics, but mainly the camera, and how it moves when you don't control it. Also a lot of moves in combat trigger in someway the main character to do a flip. I'm here for the gameplay not looking up an andriod's skirt, so I try to avoid acknowlaging it, but even then, I feel like this shouldn't be in this game.-The map is terrible. The game is also terrible at telling you where to go. This works for the game sometimes because it wants you to explore, but when you don't know where to explore it gets hard. My main issue though is with the 3d map, which is extremely hard to read in some areas. The minimap is fine, and I would have loved to see a flat map rather than a 3d voxel map. -The scenery models have bad hitboxes. Every model in this game is good looking and generally has good hitboxes, but a lot of buildings in this game have holes in the walls, but you are unable to walk through them. This looks amazing in the world but it shows the artists didn't communicate with the people actually coding the game or the other way around. Theres so many buildings that should be accessible that aren't and it just feels immersion breaking.-Pausing the game is agravating to do. You can always pause the game, but if you want to access menus you can't be moving. So if you move at all before accessing the pause menu you see a empty screen that says ""paused""Now I've had a lot of fun with this game and think its worth buying. I just suggest you be careful and read more reviews before you buy.			"

												The game has technical issues, I didnt have many of the ones people mentioned, but they are there for a lot of people.There are some unofficial mods out there that fix some of the most common issues people are having though, may want to give those a try.Technical Stuff:For me the problems were resolution & the game not playing nice with gforce experience/shadow play, which made recording gameplay a pain since I would need a different application. Not a big deal honestly if you dont care about this.The resolution problem i had was the game crashed a few times when changing the resolution to 1080, I dont consider this a big deal either because after i finally was able to leave this as 1080 it never did crash again, 12 hours later, finished the first ending and I had 0 crashes.Another technical issue the game has which is not actually a glitch or a bug, but an actual design decision is the game is locked at 60fps and cutscenes at 900p 30fps, this looks god awful specially since everything is nice at 60 and then a cutscene happens and it looks inconsistent and very disjointed, kind of kills the immersion on every cutscene.One other issue that is VERY annoying is the game changes displays when I launch it after a windows reboot/shut down, regardless of what display is selected in the options, it always tries to go to my 2nd monitor instead of the 1st, again not a big deal, but its definitely annoying. Resetting the option(which closes the game for some reason) in settings usually fixes the problem though.Game Itself:The game is great, its tons of fun, the combat is Bayonetta 2 levels of good but with the Gothic loli twist, you can handle 2 main weapons at once with the pods serving as support with gunfire and special attacks, combat is tight, responsive and feels very rewarding. The rest of the game feels very much like a Square Enix game, so expect all the typical cheesy Japanese story stuff that comes from these jrpgs, its still a very enjoyable story though and the multiple endings add a lot of replay value.The world is kind of open, not truly open world like say Witcher 3 or Breath of the Wild, etc. There are bounds to where you can go and what you can explore but what is there is not empty or boring, there is some exploration and sightseeing to do still.The sidequests are not bad either theres a few boring ones, but some of them have decent dialogue that in my opinion add a bit of sense and context to the current status of this version of earth.SoundThe sound in general was good, soundtrack was great but some of the tracks do get a bit repetitive since they are bound to areas you explore and you spend more time in some places than others. Repetitive is not neccesarily a bad thing in this case though, the OST is excellent.Voice acting I think was good, I know the english voice acting is not as great as the original Japanese, but its still very good. 9S Voice actor specially does a really good job.Conclusion:All in all an enjoyable game, Very fun, I wholeheartedly recommend it,Update:Finished all the main endings A, B, C, D & E. All I can say is this game deserves to be played by everyone, I dont believe this type of story can be told in any other medium that is not an actual video game, so just buy this game, you wont regret it.

												As a game, Nier Automata is good, but not incredible. Instead the game is a medium for its OUTSTANDING story. Nier Automata is a work of art, and an emotional and existential journey that you should not miss out on			"

												I am amazed and positively stunned by the game (I have never played or even heard of the other Nier-games before). It looks great, the characters are fantastic and the world is perfectly sculpted to give you the exact feel you need to get drawn into the story. It is not just some open world to explore, it is a world where every step makes you feel that whatever war you think you are fighting there is ultimatively futile and not worth going for. And yet the nature and growth everywhere makes it clear that no matter what happens, life will go on and that there is always a future.I love it.I even accept combat high heels and goth dresses even when I usually would always go for practical outfits. But in this case it fits and it is not only the protagonist wearing it but actually every member of this wonderful goth army.And then there is the soundtrack. It is fantastic and creates a good background to what is going on on the screen.A solid 10/10 from me and possibly one of the games I will remember and come back to for many years to come.But the best thing ... it still plays fluidly on my three years old lappy. It is a great lappy still, but there is no denying that three years is old when it comes to computers.			"

												Absolutely amazing, didn't even realize how much the game changes after the third playthrough. Other than the full screen bug and some cutscene frame drops Nier is rich in story. How you may ask? The weapons when you level them up have their own story, characters have their own story, side ones, NPC's, etc. It's mind boggling how invested you get when you do them. It's not always a chore, there is legitimate investment in most of the quests. Hell, you can even ride wildlife around it's so good. I just started on my third playthrough and I'm so emotionally attached to the characters and what happens into the third part of the story I won't spoil but it put me through a rollercoaster of emotions.Battle system is simplistic yet fun, the chips you put into your memory is customizable all the way down to your hud (literally can remove your minimap to equip something that would be more important to you.). There's fishing even though it didn't even need to be in it and that's enjoyable in spurts. The weapons are beautiful and also upgrade to special abilities. There's a lot to this game I haven't found out and I WANT to find it. Also the soundtrack is beautiful. When I stream I turn off my main music so that my viewers can enjoy the beauty that is the Nier: Automata Soundtrack.In the end, Nier: Automata is poetry in motion, fun combat with a rich story. It's definitely worth the price it currently is, even if you live in Canada where it's 80 bucks. Even at 80 it's worth all the money. Thank you Platinum for making a game for a person who never played the first game and is now invested in it.			"

												Platinum Game know their ♥♥♥♥. Nier Automata is a sequel of the origin Nier but you don't need to play Nier to understand Nier Automata since there is very few if none connection between these games. Nier Automata tells a story of the distant future where the Earth is invaded by aliens and humans are forced to the moon. Aliens build machines in order to keep human from the Earth. Hunans build Android's to try to reclaim the Earth and 2B is one of them. I am currently in my second play through right now so I haven't​ get into the meat and potatoes for the story so far. Therefore I will just say the story is pretty good and sometimes can be weird and sad.Nier Automata is an action focused RPG. By action focused I mean 90% action and 10% RPG. The game play required some precise timed button pressing for different attack combo and dodging. And killing enemies while looking good is very satisfying indeed. In the easier difficulty the game even allows auto dodge and attack so the game pretty much plays itself. But in higher difficulties it can get challenging as well. Oh and the 10% RPG part. You level up, you can upgrade your weapon and you can install something call chip to enhance yourself, that's pretty much all the RPG elements in the game.Contrast from the fancy gameplay, the open-world of Nier Automata is bland and lifeless. Though the background of the game is supposed to be lifeless I guess I can't complain too much. The size of this open-world is not that large, it's not even close to the open-world in Skyrim or GTA-5. And there are so many ""invisible walls"" that really make this open-world less immersive.The game comes with English and Japanese sound tracks. I don't speak Japanese so I had to go with the English sound track and it's pretty good. But I think the Japanese one is better and feels more natural since characters in the game come with Asian faces anyway. The music in the game is, for lack of better word, amazing. I would suggest you to YouTube it's OST and I promise you won't regret it. Overall I will put Nier Automata as one of the best if not THE best ARPG I've ever played. Characters look cool and sexy(if you know what I mean). Control is responsive. Music is amazing. PS. Have to mention this. The game itself is great but the PC port is not so great. At the moment of this review it suffers from some resolution bug that lower your resolution of the game when you go into full screen. And it's also one of the newer game that doesn't have borderless window mode. This means if you have social media or something that need to deal with constantly, switching between game and desktop will not be a smooth experience. Besides resolution bug, the performance of this PC port also takes a serious hit. I am running and 6700 with a GTX980Ti and with high setting the game still managed to stutter here and there. It's not a perfect 60fps for me and if you have a similar or lower end graphics card, it won't be for you either. The developer release a statement on steam saying thanks and claims they are looking into the bugs and will release update for the game so I hope these issue will be iron out soon.Overall great game. 93/100			"

												OK... I am writing this to explain things a bit better than all those plp complaining about this game.... My system is:i7 860 water cooled with heavy OC (it gets results as good as an FX8350)8GB of RAMSSDRadeon RX480I can run all new demanding games maxed at 60fps.However Nier Automata will not run at 60fps although the graphic detail is much lower than so many other games out there that run so much smoother.On the other hand the situation is not bad. The game is playable not optimum but not bad at all. Reverting to driver 16.11.5 the game runs without any crashes or any other problems that other plp complain about.I do not see the reason why everybody complains so badly. The game just released for pc, it will be patched that is for sure. New drivers will be released soon. Especially for AMD Radeon I am confident the fix will be very fast as they always release drivers very often and supporting all new and old cards. For Nvidia older than latest GTX10X0 cards... GOOD LUCK they will never release drivers other than their latest GPUs. I am pretty confident for the 1060, 1070, 1080 that there will be a much better driver soon.Another bug that I see in this game is the fullscreen mode. But why so much noise about it? You can run in window mode just fine! Hide the task bar and after 5 mins of game you will forget about the window thing. I am sure there is going to be a fix for this very soon.Other than the performance and reliably minor issues the game feels and seems fantastic. I would definitely recommend it. It is something different that you will remember and definitely worth to buy. "

Accompanied by powerful storytelling, excellent game design, diversified gameplay, and a mesmerizing soundtrack that will send chills up your spine, Nier: Automata is in my books as one of the best single-player games I have had the joy of experiencing.This game will exceed your expectations. Over and over again. Don't let the ""ending"" fool you, continue playing your save if you haven't already. There is a lot more waiting for you.  "

												TL;DL + Conclusion:I think this game is extremely well made and I found it an amazing game to binge on and try to complete as much of it as I could. You will lose yourself in the story, engrossed in the unfolding events surrounding 2B, 9S, and eventually A2!  You will at times say “Okay just a few more minutes” or “Just till the end of this mission”, only to be given a new task even more difficult and engrossing that the last, making you only want to see it to the end. If you love a amazing story like that, which has some solid gameplay mechanics thrown in with almost 2-3 games worth of content? Then this is the game for you!EXTENDED REVIEW:This is a review for Nier:Automata at currently 30hrs in-game. This may contain spoilers and is my first ever review. I would also like to say that I have and will only ever play the game with a controller as the game has a hack-n-slash gamestyle and I have found from past experience that games such as this are better played with one.Within the game I have unlocked the A, B, C, D, E and O endings on normal difficulty, however there are a total of 26 endings for you to discover and unlock.This first thing of note with this game is you do not need to have played any of the games before this one, including the one titled “Nier”, as it is a completely stand-alone game that tells the story itself without the need to reference other games. The game is set in a world where humans no longer reside on the earth and have escaped to the moon due to an alien machine invasion. An organisation called YoRHa comprised completely of androids are tasked with wiping out this threat. The story takes place following the androids code-named 2B, 9S and later A2, depicting their struggle as they choose to either follow with their emotions or their duty.Story:    10/10I usually buy games for not only their solid gameplay mechanics and a story that I can get engrossed and lose myself in. In my opinion Nier: Automata does that for me and more, I have never felt the need to binge on a game as much as I did on this title. I will admit that the second play-through of this game there were times I felt it was a bit repetitive but as there was another perspective added to it making this completely worthwhile. As mentioned above there are three different characters you can play as and each one has their own story and emotions toward what they are doing, making this game almost feel like it was 2-3 games in one!For the playthrough following 2B I decided to stick strickly to the main story where possible so I could unravel the story as quickly as I could. After completing the game once I decided to try and complete more side missions and I will say that not only do they help you gain some amazing experience and items but they also add so much more to the story being told giving more depth to the mission and androids you meet along the way.Audio:  10/10Like some other titles I have played, I feel Nier:Automata has an amazing soundtrack that can complement the situations/locations perfectly. When you are at the base camp on earth you are greeted by a pleasantly calming melody that really makes you feel safe while in combat the music changes to a more dramatic/climactic song making you feel energized while fighting.Similar to the soundtrack I feel the SFX within the game are perfectly suited for the areas that are located within the game but for one small exception, the slide. Within the story you create a slide for some children to play on and when your character slides down it it makes the same sound you hear when you slide down a dune in the desert area, which I thought to be pretty funny. Still it is such a small gripe I don’t think it is worth a mark down for.Difficulty:   9/10I feel the way this game deals with difficulty is great and I could only fault it due to its hard to manage fights with large number of enemies. In Nier:Automata if you select the easy difficulty the enemies are not just made more stupid and basically the game plays itself but rather you are given options on how much help you wanted. These options are presented as “System Upgrade Chips” each one having a different perk to help a player having difficulty. In other words if you don’t like getting slaughtered constantly but you don’t want your hand being held then this game may have what you need! However as mentioned above I feel the game deals poorly with a large group of enemies sometimes having closer to 10-15 enemies attacking you almost at the same time each one dishing out some pretty nasty damage, making the game in my opinion harder than most.Game Mechanics:   9/10When it comes to the First-person, Top-down and Side-scroller aspects of the game mechanics I feel extremely well implemented adding a whole new depth to the game and the story as a whole. The only complaint on this feature I have is how easy it was for me to get lost when the camera changed as it was quite annoying or having an enemy out of my field of view who was attacking me. Missions/Side-Mission/Challenges: 9.5/10Once again I feel that missions are extremely well implemented in this game, the only one complaint I have is there were 1-2 side missions still present on my radar, that could not be reached at a certain part in the story while all the others were gone (giving me the “O” ending). Aside from that I think other games I have played could benefit from implementing a quest map mechanic like the one in Nier:Automata. Once a mission has been accepted you are given a marker like any other game which can also be viewed on you minimap, but the map located in your menu is actually a 3D low poly render allowing you to not only view the map from a bird's-eye view but also zoom and look at a part of the map almost at ground level giving you not only the location but sometimes the elevation of missions which helps out a massive amount.Character design and Animation:  9/10People who are viewing this game would have probably noticed that it has more of a Japanese style to the models and animation in the game. I am personally a fan of this form of art so I prefer it to any other type of art that could have been used on a game such as this one. As people may have also seen in other reviews the rear-end on the androids 2B and A2 are quite big but not so much that it looks disproportionate. Being the only male voiced characters in the game, 9S, Adam and Eve their body types were somewhat more diverse that I expected. One was more childish with an average build while the others had a pretty boy face, tall and slightly muscular build rather than the generic hulking male model you would usually get stuck with and/or fight.As mentioned above the animation style has a Japanese flair to it (originating from Japan it is to be expected), but especially in fight instances they do not feel out of place or robotic but rather fluid and lifelike. The only complaint I have is that the english voices that were dubbed over the originals do not sync up that well to the mouth animations due to the fact that the faces are animated to the Japanese actors who voiced them.Voice Acting:  9/10Even though the the rating may not reflect this to some, I think the voices used in the game are excellent and fit perfectly to the characters, Kira Buckland pulled off the abrasive but caring 2B and Kyle McCarley portrayed an immature but then extremely emotional 9S perfectly! The only complaint I have is that there are instances where there is only text rather than voiced lines where you could expect them to be. This happens so much during the game making me wonder wouldn’t it have been easier to fill the entire dialogue with voiced lines rather than starting out with text only?			"

												Simply put, this game is nothing short of a masterpiece. Between the rich story with well thought out characters, the beautiful world design and incredible soundtrack, NieR: Automata is an amazing experience from start to finish. The story is done in a way that can only truely be realized as a video game, but it's impossible to elaborate without spoiling significant parts of it. The main story is roughly 30 hours in length, however the side quests are all very much worth completing for the depth it adds to the world.Combat wise, the system is simple yet satisfying, and the plug-in chip system (almost similar to badge system from Paper Mario) give you plenty of ways to customise your skills. There's a huge variety of weapons from small swords, large swords, spears and combat bracers (punching gloves), each of which you can upgrade both to enhance the weapon as well as tell the story of the weapon's origin.As for the negatives, while the world's concept is fantastic, the execution can be rather shoddy. This is very clear in the starting city as many buildings are very hollow and featureless yet are abundant with invisible walls. The quality of the world design veries heavily from current gen back to earily ps3-era graphics. The performance doesn't quite stack up either as it's quite a bit more resource heavy than the visuals would lead you to believe. I would reccomend downloading the fan patch (simple one-button install) on the steam community forums before you starting.Overall, the positives more than make up for the negatives and is an overall joy to play. Despite the low amount of advertising, I hope this work of art gets the recognition it deserves. I can't reccomend it enough.			"

												Favorite game of 2017? Favorite game of 2017 and probably one of my most favorite RPG.I am not good at writing reviews but I do think that this game deserves a lot of praise.There some problems with the game currently, yes. I have crashed twice within my 37 current hours but it's not a big deal. Unlike some of these people who are complaining, I actually save quite often so I don't lose a lot of progress.There's currently a mod that allows you to bring out the best in the game, just look it up. Let's you do fullscreen, borderless, and other cool settings for the game.It also helps with crashing, etc.Another issue that people have is the whole saving situation.I agree that in the beginning and some parts throughout the game, there are long scenes where you cannot save. When you die, you gotta restart all the way back. The good thing is is that you can skip cutscenes and that the game isn't too difficult for you to get back to where you were in a good decent amount of time.Personally, i am SO happy that this game does not feed you auto-saves. If you die, you die. Big whoop. Time to go through everything you just did. You'll do it faster cause you already did it once. It's a learning curve. Also, use the dash feature. It's really helpful in dodging attacks.And another thing I wanna bring up. PLEASE, PLEASE do not drop this game for the little fanservice that it has. If you actually play the game instead of worrying about 2B's butt, you will not even care about it. Unless you're a pervert... then of course you will care. ; )The combat mechanics are nothing too spectacular or new but it does provide for some really fun fighting.Especially that dodge mechanic, DAMN. Really cool to use that, and useful!Character development? It's pretty good. I usually only bash character development if they don't feel relatable or have an in-depth backstory.The characters are pretty lovable. They share the same emotions that most of us have, maybe even the same problems. You know, besides the whole Earth has ended kind of thing.As for backstory, a lot of it comes more clear towards the end of the game but there are things that you can do to find out some backstory yourself instead of it being fed to you.The soundtrack, oh boy. It always seems to fit the area that you are in, which is good. It means the devs know what they are doing.I sometimes wanna listen to the soundtracks on YouTube in my free time but I always get emotional when listening to it after what I experienced in this game.I recommend doing every single main ending. I really do. You will get a nice treat of a true ending if you do.Please do not give up. I can say that it was totally worth it.That also goes for the other joke endings. They are quite hilarious.I also recommend doing side quests and gathering lots of materials. They are really useful for upgrading and selling more some sweet sweet monies.Side quests also give some decent EXP. I had about 80% quest completion done by the time I was through with the entire game (all main endings), and I was able to get through the game fairly easily.I am currently working on getting all achievements and trying to get 100% everything cause I'm a no life. Safe to say that I might have at least 80+ hours by the end of it all.Like I said, I experienced many emotions playing this game. I definitely rate it highly and wish that many more people will at least try the game.Sorry if my review was garbo. I try my best.			"

												This game is simply awesome, since the very beginning you're getting the old school fighting from Platinum games and the story starts with 2B and 9S being introduced. Normal mode is quite easy but sometimes you can have some problems against the enemies, Hard mode it is really hard and you can get one-shot instantly if you're trying to rush the fights or avoiding upgrading yourself. Soundtrack 10/10, Voice actors 10/10, combat is a 10/10 with mixes of 3D-2D-Aerial fights, hacking etc. The only issues are the FPS drops on cut scenes that happens probably thanks to Nvidia drivers (they're not out for Nier Automata, have to wait some days for that) but the game runs at 60 fps 4K without problems. As advice DO NOT listen the idiots and players that are making bad reviews just because they are a bunch of ignorant trolls, the game IS GOOD and is worth every single dollar.EDIT, can contain spoilers!Finished the game with all the main endings (A, B, C, D, E (true ending)), this game is a 10/10, excellent story, development, characters, emotions, gameplay, etc. Is one of those gems that you will find once after many years, Square Enix did an amazing job with this game and you can see it on all the little details, even the credits are especial. Obviously I will play it again in the future, so glad I bought this game, a marvelous piece of art.			"

												You'll love the game.You'll hate (and somewhat love) the director.The balance between combat and storytelling is superb and pretty much every ""boring"" moment through the game can be explained with an artistic point of view.Fresh gameplay style, well developed characters and extremely good BGM. Oh, and heavy Nietzsche influence.As for the cons...-Ongoing dialogue can be easily interrupted by another one; so the player can't rush through scenarios; otherwise he is going to miss some lines.-Translation: I'm the type who loves to watch/play things with original audio and translated subtitles to laugh at the differences (yeah, I'm an ""original elitist""). As such, I noticed that the english translation isn't bad, but is way too goofy. Characters (especially early 2B and later 9S) will frequently speak something that doesn't match their japanese tone.For instance; the concept of dying is important through the game. As such, japanese 2B says ""break"". The english one will say ""die"". Honest expressions of shock are turned to something along the lines of ""oh well"".			"

												10/10*Graphics*Some people have been complaining about performance issues, personally I have not had any but I'm sure they do exist, My settings are maxed and the game runs fantastic and looks absolutely STUNNING. I run a constant 60 fps. The game has such great detail and amazing shaders to make the game look great. The only issue I have with this game and graphics is the cutscenes, I personally don't care about them but I know some people do and if you are a big fan of great, cinematic cutscenes you might not like this. The cut scenes have worse FPS than the actual game and the quality is much worse than the game, The Game looks like its from 2017 but the cutscenes look like they are from 2010, If that doesn't bother you than buy this game. Other than the cutscenes the game looks AMAZING.*Combat*By far the most impressive part of this game. It combines a perfect balance of a hack and slash 3rd person game, a 3rd person shooter and a platformer at some parts. The visuals and animations are amazing. There are so many customizable items and moves. Nothing is too overpowered or too underpowered. If something swings fast, it does low damage, if something swings slow it does high damage and there are items somewhere in the middle with a balance of both. Overall the combat is amazing and very addicting to play.*Story* Not the most gripping storyline ever, but that's not what I'm playing the game for, The story is basically about androids that are fighting a war against more robots and some occasional naked men. The story is pretty good to someone who isnt too critical about it, But if you are looking for a game where you will get deeply attached to characters and what they go through. Overall not bad*Interface,Settings and GUI*Nothing to impressive, I really like the menu though, I play the game with an Xbox One Controller so I can't put too much input into this as I'm sure most are playing with a keyboard and mouseOverall, This game is unbelieveable in my opinion, The majority of bad reviews are just about performance issues because they don't have a good computer, It's 2017 you can't be expecting to play 60fps high quality with anything below a 960 or below the Radeon 400X series. If you have a pretty good rig, this game should run fine. This game looks amazing, plays amazing and is overall one of the best games I've touched this year.IS IT WORTHABUY???If you don't mind not having a GREAT story you just want some fantastic combat and visuals, YES this game is 100% worth a buy for 60 Dollars			"

												This game was something else, the best description I can make is that its a steampunk combination of Metal Gear Rising: Revengance and Dark Souls. If you love one or both of those games buy Neir: Automata right this second!This game may well be a perfect 10 / 10 aside from a couple graphical issues with the resolution in full screen (what game launches now-a-days without a hiccup). To fix the resolution issue I had to download some open source software called Borderless Gaming, either buy it through Steam or download the installer from their Github page, then add Neir: Automata to the favourite list and every time you launch the game it'll be put into a borderless window mode that will fix the 1080p resolution.Im running an intel core i5-4690K and a gigabyte 970 and I was able to play on maximum settings without a problem, constantly over 60 FPS and no screen tearing. I also played with a controller which I cannot emphasize makes the game way more enjoyable, but this is a guideline for any third person slasher like this anyway.			"

												Game is played on a 4790K @ 4.85Ghz/R9 Fury X/32gb of ddr3 2428mhz RamPros:- Perfect mechanics - Great transition from Hack and Slash to the Shmup levels- Beautiful visuals - Nice OST- Full customization of controller settings (big plus)!!- Runs great at 4K (3840x2160) 60FPS in fullscreen mode (if you're not Alt Tabbing or switching to a task on a secondary monitor) on my setup. Cons:- Cutscenes are locked at 30fpsNow, I'm not a ""PC Master-race"" guy and I don't really care if a whole game is locked at 30FPS since your eyes get used to it during a gaming session. But when you're blazing through the action at 60fps and immediately get thrown into a 30fps cutscene it is very noticeable and kind of breaks the immersion.- Camera is kind of iffy at first until you change the settings to your liking in the settings menu.- 4K not yet fully supported, so you might have some issues.4k is available in the option list but isn't fully supported and if you're in Fullscreen Mode then Alt-Tabbing (or switching to a task on a secondary monitor) is weird if you're running 4K, it makes your screen go white. That issue doesn't come up when I'm playing 1440p or 1080p though.			"

												Everything I could ever want from a spiritual successor to NieR, and more. It fixes EVERY PROBLEM that game had, literally everyone.I want good ♥♥♥ combat mechanics, bosses, character movement, animations, traversal mechanics etc.Done. We got Platinum Games doing it.I want constantly changing gameplay systems every minute with the simple movement of the camera.Done. Like I said, Platinum Games knows what the ♥♥♥♥ they're doing.I want cool stylish menus with upgrade systems, weapons, abilities and RPG mechanics that are interesting to play with.Done.But they have to make sense in the story and the metagame, right?OH DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT. THEY SURE DO.What about some Dark Souls ♥♥♥♥? I can't sleep well at night if you don't put some Souls-like elements in every game!Ok fine. We got them as well.I want sidequests actually worth a ♥♥♥♥, with interesting stories and dialogues.Done. You'll actually want to do them this time around!I want a fishing minigame where I don't lose my ♥♥♥♥ing mind over the overly-complicated mechanics.Done. It's easy and for babies.WHERE'S THE BOAR. MORE BOAR DRIFTING INITIAL D STYLE.Done. Also you can ride mooses because shut up.I want the best soundtrack ever. AGAIN. Done. Keiichi Okabe is here. Also Emi Evans. And J'Nique Nicole, the new singer, is amazing as well.I'm just here for the Yoko Taro™ style story, with mind♥♥♥♥s and themes and plotwists that will keep me awake at night and cool ♥♥♥♥ing characters and depressing stuff at every corner.Yeah don't worry. It's all there.I want THICC girls with killer thighs and nice butts.Let me tell you about the new character designer, Akihiko Yoshida...Is 2B's butt really that good?Worth buying the game full price just for that.

												While the game is getting a huge amount of praise, the PC port is really bad.  Riddled with bugs and performance issues for some users and completely unplayable for others.AMD users are finding the game crashing to a white screen which can only be fixed by rolling back drivers.  Some nVidia users are finding the screen freezes and, though you can hear the game is still running by the sounds it makes, it does not recover.  Because the game has no save point for a SUBSTANTIAL amount of time at the beginning, these users have no way to progress in the game.The developers have been aware of the issue for some time but, over two weeks from release, they have still not released a patch and it seems unlikely they will do so.With the Steam refund deadline rapidly approaching and with no word on a patch from the devs, I was forced to refund this game.

												If you're looking to get NieR: Automata solely for android booty and/or Platinum combat you may either be sorely disappointed or pleasantly surprised by what you actually find yourself experiencing. NieR: Automata is the niche sequel to the niche first NieR game in the niche NieR series which is a spinoff of the niche Drakengard series (the games are pretty niche). While neither the first NieR nor the Drakengard series are required to be played to enjoy Automata, doing so will greatly enhance your experience and I'd strongly recommend that you at least familiarize yourself with the story of the first NieR and its connection with Drakengard before playing NieR: Automata (this will also help you decide if NieR: Automata is a purchase deserving of your time and money).  Whether you decide to take that plunge or not, avoiding spoilers would be something I'd also recommend. Now to get into why I'd personally recommend the game:PROS:-The gameplay is the best it has ever been for the series-The story is an emotional rollercoaster not quite like anything I've experienced before and a well deserved sequel to the first NieR-An absolutely incredible soundtrack that harkens back to the first game's, using its melodies and vocals for emotional impact as well as having entirely original songs that will leave their own new mark on you-One of the most profound moments I've experienced from a game in my nearly two decades of gaming (to say anymore would be spoilers)-Perspective and gameplay changes that keep things fresh and intense-Sidequests with great stories of their own-In keeping with the tradition of the series, multiple endings and further insights on repeat playthroughs that give you a reason to play through the game again-Countless ""little things"" that add to the overall experience CONS:-The PC port isn't the greatest at the time of writing (the community has already put out several fixes for various problems)-A gameplay mechanic introduced in the middle of the game can become somewhat repetitive-While the combat system is deep and fluid the game never requires or incentivises you (other than satisfying yourself with flashy combos) to expand past mashing light attack, holding down the fire button and spamming the incredibly forgiving dodge (at least on normal difficulty)-A somewhat bland but atmospheric open world setting-The sidequests are mostly menial fetch quests, gameplay wise-The English voice over isn't the best, in my opinion (luckily there's a Japanese voice option)While being rough around some edges, NieR: Automata is immensely greater than the sum of its parts. It's definitely left an impact on me, so much so that I've thought about the game non-stop since completing it and it's earned a spot as one of my favorite games of all time.			"

												I'm still early in the game so I can't say much about it but it looks promising, the only frustrating thing yet is that normal difficulty is way too easy, and hard difficulty is too hard (you will usually get killed in 1 hit, maybe 2 if you are lucky, by ennemies with a few levels over you), hard difficulty becomes more doable later in the game with chips upgrade and everything, but something between both would have been good because the balance isn't perfect as it is.HOWEVER, there are a lot of issues with this pc port, so be aware of that:- A lot of resolution / aspect ratio problems, like black bars on each borders in 1080p, same hdmi problems as metal gear rising with 1080i signal etc... You can however fix them by creating a custom resolution of 1919x1080 and setting the scaling menu in the nvidia control pannel on ""No scaling"", or by using a tool to force windowed borderless mode:https://github.com/Codeusa/Borderless-Gaming/releases- The game is VERY demanding, and it shouldn't be with graphics like that, I have a GTX 690 and without sli (so GTX 680 situation) the gpu runs at 100% all the time with around 40 fps in 1080p, so people with 680, 770, 960 and such, be aware that it will struggle.- SLI FIX : You can enable the sli and fix the bad sli scaling by using the 0x080002F5 sli bits in nvidia inspector, however it seems to not be working when doing it manually for some people, so here is an uploaded profile with the sli bits in it, just import it in nvidia inspector and you should be good to go, thanks to this I can now play with a solid 60 fps in 1080p.:https://mega.nz/#!boMmxIYL!Ht5j76RQr8h7ccM1glOwIbVpS3DsLg9uciAF0j6F7AI "

												A complete masterpiece, I haven't played a game that's drawn me in and made me feel so strongly about its characters in the history of all games I've ever played.I don't want to spoil anything for anyone, so I'll keep things fairly generic for this review.Positives:The story is dark, intelligent yet inspiring and contains so many plot twists that keep you guessing for the entire game.Every single one of the characters, major or minor, have considerable depth and personality to them. Not one character is shallow or boring.The music is excellently fitting in every part of the game, and conveys the rollercoaster of emotions in this game perfectly.The gameplay is smooth, polished and fast paced. Combat difficulty can be changed at any time if you want more or less of a challenge.The story is meaty and takes a considerably amount of time to complete. I finished it in 37 hours which, for a single player game, is a REALLY good length. There's so much content in this game!Other than a few graphical issues described later, the actual game and gameplay have no bugs or glitches whatsoever. This is an excellent change from most of the recent big gaming releases.Negatives:While the environments feel great, they resemble the sort of graphics you'd expect from a last generation PS3 game. All of the characters look modern, it's just the environments that look a little bit dated. However this is such a small negative that is far outweighed by all of the other positive aspects of this game.You can't save during the introduction, so if you die you'll have to repeat it. This was slightly frustrating, but understandble when you realise how the saving mechanic works in this game.The game has a few technical issues that some people have encountered. The only bug I had was a strange fullscreen resolution bug that I managed to fix by setting the game in windowed mode, and running the Borderless Gaming[github.com] application to force the game in to full screen.Final Words:Please buy and play NieR:Automata. I honestly believe that Platinum Games deserves the money for this one. This has become my favourite game of all time, and I believe it could be yours too if you give it a try :)I deleted all of my save data to help someone achieve the true ending, I hope they enjoyed it as much as I did!

												Great game so far, but the PC port could be better. The port isn't terrible, but the reported widespread issues are present (as of launch, will update when patches are released).running at 1080p on high, there have been no fps issues on my machine. (8GB RX480, FX-8300, 16GB RAM)I did have to rollback my GPU drivers to stop crashing, but that's only if you have an RX400 series card.The upscaling res bug can be bypassed with windowed mode or borderless via a 3rd party app, but that really needs to be fixed, like, very soon. At least the game itself plays well, even if the cutscenes are at 30fps.Hopefully later I can talk more about how great the game itself is, rather then where the PC version falls short. It's good enough to the point where I'm not refunding it, but if you're skeptical, you might want to wait for a patch or two.For AMD users, the driver I rolled back to was 16.11.5.			"

Wonderful is an understatement. The soundtrack is perfect and fits with the setting. Speaking of the setting... IMMERSION. As soon as you finish the tutorial and get into the city, you will get this calming feeling as you explore around with the soundtrack. Definitely recommend a controller for this game. As a die hard Kingdom Hearts fan, I feel right at home playing this game. Everything about it reminds me of the KH series. Feels like an open world version of it.

												Judgement: Nier Automata has amazing graphics, an exciting and intuitive combat system, an amazing storyline, and a vast world with so many side quests that it makes it feel almost like an open sandbox game. 10/10Pros: Literally everything. Graphics? Top notch. Gameplay? Top notch. Storyline? Top notch. Length of game? Top ♥♥♥♥ing notch. This game is worth much more than $60. Treat yoself and buy this game.Cons: The game has crashed twice for me so far, and I would like them to fix that. Furthermore, considering that this game has 26 endings, I'd like a way to save in specific slots rather than just quick save. Too many side quest markers sometimes overwhelm the user.			"

												hmmmmm its a good game. i'd say, really a real good game. You see, combat happens like a river, requires some degree of refinement from the player. Dont you think that swinging your weapon around is going to take you much far, testing is required. From a perspective of someone who is playing hard mode ofc.The fun is also in the sidequests, the comentaries of the characters and lines, there are many places to go and things to do, some quests reveal things that you were not supposed to know about the story and lore, making you only feel more entangled into the game. Other small things too.i enjoyed fishing, racing, hacking, flying exploring was fun too.score is Suicide Robot/2B's ♥♥♥PS: her ♥♥♥ is just a bonus for those who care. so much to do there is no time/point to look up her skirt ( you can detonate her to take the skirt away anyway)			"

Highly recommend this game! True to its name NeiR will give you a great story to unfold, a stunning world to explore! and an amazing smooth gameplay. Now before I go on about how amazing this game is I have to say the following, you absolutely need a controller for this game! a controller makes this game far more enjoyable than playing this game on keyboard and mouse!That this game comes from a console it is in my opinion that it only has limited controller support makes this a huge drawback for me, I spent the first hour of the game mapping my profiler to ensure that I have good gameplay!This should have been fully functional with the release! Pros
Highly replayable story! (No joke you will replay this game several times just to unlock more endings)Amazing soundtrack! the music is something that really sets the mood in the game, and they hit the nail on the head with this soundtrack!Dynamic open world to explore.Great character development, each with their own stories to explore.Amazing hack and slash combat style.Nice throwback to arcade gameplay styles.Amazing camera movement both free and locked angles as it switched from 3D free to 2D in certain situations. Beautifull cutscenes, that will give you chills over your spine sometimes. Cons
NO full controller support! (please fix this! the game needs a controller to be played to it's fullest!)Short main story, the game focusses heavy on the replayability of the game.Long term combat might become repetitive. If it does I highly suggest changing the combat difficulty, this adds a nice incentive to keep playing.High price, is it worth the 60 bucks, for me it is, but personally I think this is fairly steep. Minor bugs with resolution. "

												Not only will you drive a roller coaster full of emotions, you will even drive an actual roller coaster!NieR:Automata aside from some port issues is a stunning JRPG directed by Yoko Taro. A well done story with great plots supported by beautiful soundtracks composed by Keiichi Okabe.I don't want to go deep into the story since it's easy to spoil something. I can just recommend to play this game yourself to gain the best experience out of it. This game is definitly worth it.			"

												>>> Don't mind me. I like to keep this note in Steam as backup. :) <<<FYI: I completed the game with the true endings: Route A, B, C, and D at Hard. I am not going do the story at Very Hard mode... It would just kill my motivation.Nier Automata PC REVIEWPRO: - Graphic is superior at 1080p60- My favorite character styles: White Hair and Black clothes! Just many beautiful characters out there!- Auto-Run mode! Wonderful hotkey to allow hands rest.CON:- Controller Setting need to add keybind for some actions like evade and midair dash. Double-Tapping to evade is extremely poor since evade will not work after few evades in tight intervals. There was no way to choose items after Scroll Down, only if player uses both Keyboard and Mouse. [There was a discussion about a mod that using autohotkey to bind key to actions which requires time-consuming and double tap to activate. For example, Press Shift while move will help 2B to evade in less stress work]- Graphic Setting does not support full screen on second monitor while recording/streaming via OBS [I use Windowed Borderless Gaming as solution by put the game in windowed and use WBG to play it on second monitor]- Cutscene runs at 30 FPS during everything else runs at 60 FPS... FPS goes up and down again and again actually hurts my eyes because I HAD TO adjust my sight to watch at game's FPS.- Going to a map in menu takes longer time to access than intention... It should take few clicks or key to pop into map quickly.- While looking at Active Quests, it won't pinpoint in map right away, so I had to look for it on map myself...BUGs:- Few quests will pinpoint at wrong area or out of bounds. For example, Lost Little Sister quest after escort the Little Sister to the end shows that it points at out of bound near The Tower of the City. It disappears after turned in the quest to The Big Sister Machine.- Sometimes your partner will get in your way when attempt to do something while he/she gets in your way. For example, 9S got in 2B's way while attempt to push crates, but she got talked instead. Another example, 2B popped at front of 9S while approach the Baby of ""Forest King,"" and it took at least 30 seconds to finish few meters walking...- Menu has lag input [Confirmed when attempt to transport]- Medium-sized Machine with a Spear has huge invisible hitbox. It hits me with at least five meters away from the tip of the spear.- Setting sometimes restored to default setting without my approval after launching the game.- Camera sometimes being crappy. ie: Fixed perspective moved slowly from area to area, and it forced me to go in blindly and got killed. Spear Machine happened to one-hit kill me when the camera did not move properly.My PC System:i7-4790k + Win 10 Pro + 16GB RAM + 500GB SSD + GTX 1080 + 1080p60 Monitors			"

												I'm still early in the game so I can't say much about it but it looks promising, the only frustrating thing yet is that normal difficulty is way too easy, and hard difficulty is too hard (you will usually get killed in 1 hit, maybe 2 if you are lucky, by ennemies with a few levels over you), hard difficulty becomes more doable later in the game with chips upgrade and everything, but something between both would have been good because the balance isn't perfect as it is.HOWEVER, there are a lot of issues with this pc port, so be aware of that:- A lot of resolution / aspect ratio problems, like black bars on each borders in 1080p, same hdmi problems as metal gear rising with 1080i signal etc... You can however fix them by creating a custom resolution of 1919x1080 and setting the scaling menu in the nvidia control pannel on ""No scaling"", or by using a tool to force windowed borderless mode:https://github.com/Codeusa/Borderless-Gaming/releases- The game is VERY demanding, and it shouldn't be with graphics like that, I have a GTX 690 and without sli (so GTX 680 situation) the gpu runs at 100% all the time with around 40 fps in 1080p, so people with 680, 770, 960 and such, be aware that it will struggle.- SLI FIX : You can enable the sli and fix the bad sli scaling by using the 0x080002F5 sli bits in nvidia inspector, however it seems to not be working when doing it manually for some people, so here is an uploaded profile with the sli bits in it, just import it in nvidia inspector and you should be good to go, thanks to this I can now play with a solid 60 fps in 1080p.:https://mega.nz/#!boMmxIYL!Ht5j76RQr8h7ccM1glOwIbVpS3DsLg9uciAF0j6F7AI "

												I can't express enough how astonished I am with the game. There are so many things I didn't expect and so many details that made the game a masterpiece for me.The gameplay is really fun, and changing through the few combat styles/camera perspectives throughout the game keeps it from getting boring fast. The visual art is beautiful (but it might not be suitable for everyone). I thought that the overly brown/gray would make it be repulsive, but the visuals attracted me as soon as the I got to the open world part.Sounds are probably the single best thing in the game. I probably spent 45 minutes in the Resistance Camp listening to the soundtrack alone. Most of them are really wonderful and fitting to the game.The atmosphere in the game is really well done, balancing between intense moments and relatively relaxed parts during explorations.The game might be seen short at first, but additional playthrough possibility that continues your personal stats (and give you a new perspective on the story) makes it worth to invest more hours into it.Overall, the game was a much bigger hit for me than I initially expected it to be, as I had my doubts whether to get it or not, that it might get repetitive as some hack 'n' slash games tend to be. It turned out to be one of the best purchases in a long time.			"

												Yoko Taro's allegorical deep-dive into Sartrean existentialism creates a medium-spanning piece of art, that will immerse players into its world and will leave them speechless, questioning what it means to exist. PC performance issues aside, the Platinum style gameplay is smooth and satisfying, and the diversity of gameplay systems will keep players from being bored, and allow them to explore new methods in taking down hordes of machines. However, this is such a small part of the game as a whole, and should be looked at as the piece of art that is, beside another hack and slash rpg. Talking about why the story is so impactful is fruitless, and is better left to be experienced by the player.			"

												A complete masterpiece, I haven't played a game that's drawn me in and made me feel so strongly about its characters in the history of all games I've ever played.I don't want to spoil anything for anyone, so I'll keep things fairly generic for this review.Positives:The story is dark, intelligent yet inspiring and contains so many plot twists that keep you guessing for the entire game.Every single one of the characters, major or minor, have considerable depth and personality to them. Not one character is shallow or boring.The music is excellently fitting in every part of the game, and conveys the rollercoaster of emotions in this game perfectly.The gameplay is smooth, polished and fast paced. Combat difficulty can be changed at any time if you want more or less of a challenge.The story is meaty and takes a considerably amount of time to complete. I finished it in 37 hours which, for a single player game, is a REALLY good length. There's so much content in this game!Other than a few graphical issues described later, the actual game and gameplay have no bugs or glitches whatsoever. This is an excellent change from most of the recent big gaming releases.Negatives:While the environments feel great, they resemble the sort of graphics you'd expect from a last generation PS3 game. All of the characters look modern, it's just the environments that look a little bit dated. However this is such a small negative that is far outweighed by all of the other positive aspects of this game.You can't save during the introduction, so if you die you'll have to repeat it. This was slightly frustrating, but understandble when you realise how the saving mechanic works in this game.The game has a few technical issues that some people have encountered. The only bug I had was a strange fullscreen resolution bug that I managed to fix by setting the game in windowed mode, and running the Borderless Gaming[github.com] application to force the game in to full screen.Final Words:Please buy and play NieR:Automata. I honestly believe that Platinum Games deserves the money for this one. This has become my favourite game of all time, and I believe it could be yours too if you give it a try :)I deleted all of my save data to help someone achieve the true ending, I hope they enjoyed it as much as I did!

												Only just properly started getting into the game but I have to recommend it right away. Amazing visuals, music, neat controls and most of all creativity and fun exploration. For an 'open world' game, the zones are very intelligently designed and distinct from each other. The game doesn't bore you like a whole lot of other open world ones or hold your hand very much. It reminds me of something like Jak and Daxter from PS2, it's not a gigantic map with the same stuff all over the place, but you travel to lots of really different places and unlock more routes between them as you go on. Gave me that feeling like you're discovering all new stuff in a super strange world.Plus it's imaginative as heck. Music will probably hypnotize you.The only downside I have to give it is that it's not a very well optimized PC port so far, had to sacrifice settings quite a bit to get it to run well, and it still has a bit of input lag and a constantly visible mouse cursor. I'd put the minimum requirements for the game a lot higher. But willing to look past that because the game itself is amazing. Don't judge it just by its intro either, there is a lot more to the game than that.			"

I,m still angry at Square Enix, They can make a very pretty game, but to get them to run right is painstakingly frustrating. Once I got the game with stable settings both in-game and through my Nvidia control panel, The game ran flawlessly with rare lag and stuttering. I loved how the game takes mecanics and changes to different view angles like side-scrolling to top-down, and back to third-person. I'm currently play through the game for the first time and the Story is very mesmorizing, graphics are amazing even on the lowest settings, and the best part about the game to me anyway is that I can use my Xbox-one Controller with the game!

												Having caught up to date with the original's story and different endings, I went in with great expectations of this game. After all, a match made in heaven was made, NieR with Platinum Games. The original game had a janky combat that hurt more than helped the game's story. Which carries the slog through the combat being not so great.But in Nier:Automata it fills in all these blank spots.The game has a satisfying feel to each move you make, You start off with 2B's squadron on a Shoot 'em up level, learning how to maneuver and plunged directly into combat right after. The amazing responsiveness of the combat a marvel to see and play through.Divided in 3 Routes, this game has probably the most content from a Platinum Game. Ranging from Fishing to doing Sidequests to Beating kickass bosses in areas ranging from various zones in an sort of open world fashion to it.Now what goes so well along with the gameplay is how well this story is written, following up on the events of NieR, almost 7000 years later or so, a rather ludicrous amount of time, but a normal thing if you're used to Yoko Taro's eccentric nature and stories. Carefully woven into a engaging story with likeable characters that grow on you more and more. It has a wonderful pacing that pays off with a huge bang on Route C. Making you take your time to learn about howthe world is after the machine invasion and how the android resistance is faring is essential to make all the characters that you meet along the way feel important. I can't explain how much this game toys with your feelings. Yoko Taro is well known for making bittersweet or sad stories.You'll feel it on your skin when it happens.tl;drPros2B's amazingly crafted Android Body2B's perfectly crafted, unreal Bottom half, from ♥♥♥ to Thighs to perfection.9S is a cool sidekickNostalgic as ♥♥♥♥ if you've played the original NieRDelicious Platinum CombatBullet Hell Shoot 'em up levelsConsPort is not so great.1080 resolution is just a upscaled 1700x900a few crashes and incompatibilities with certain graphics cards.I can't think of any other problems with this game.

												Highly recommend itStory: is very good except for some parts when You use the second char for the Ending B, I simply don't like that char, probably personal taste, but I enjoyed a lot the other two, aside from the fact that they are somewhat sexy, but the first char You use, well, the story really got me (I am omitting intentionally their names)Fights: are somewhat cool, I finished almost all the game with only Bare Fists, but still the chars are way too strong for the enemies, even with Bare Fists You are litterally too strong compared to everyone, even Bosses are a joke, sometimes in just 5-6 seconds You kill them but You have to wait all their ""phases"" to finish the battle, so You basically kill them and wait for their speech or their next phase of the fight, I am sure most of GDR players can relate to this (It's basically a GDR so You are supposed to know how to grind properly for few minutes to gain some levels)The only weapon I started to use are the Bracers, love the Bruce Lee Fight StanceGame also reminded me from some internet video (before it's release) of Raiden from MGR, infact I found so many similarities in their moveset and fighting style, I appreciate a lotOther weapons I don't know to be honest since I never used them onceMusic: oh boy the music, waiting for the soundtrack to be released, just sayin...Litterally there are only good songs and themes, I like all of them, only MGS Saga gave me this feeling with musics, there is not a single one that I don't like, huge huge huge compliments for the SoundtrackAgain: not a single one I don't like, I can listen to all of them since I like all of them, again congratulationsOverall Gameplay: I am a quite instinctive player, I saw the running animation of the protagonist and decided to buy the game, (same with tales of Berseria, I saw Velvet the protagonist do a spinning aerial kick, and I purchased the game) litterally that's what I did, just to be precise on what drive me to purchase the game, the running animation is so fine and well made, something I was looking for for long time being a fan of the MGS Ninjas (and relating to Rising/Raiden of course)The Overall Theme: the game is sad, it's really sad, few few few games can really go that deep and make You feel in a certain way, Automata made me feel very sad for days (it's not very long game anyway, all achievements can be done in very few hours, and I spent lot of time going around before the game tells You do go here or there and without using the transfer function most of the time, so, except for some specific zones, I already knew all the map before the game even mention that)As said, it's sad, sad musics, sad story, sad everything (almost ;) )But what really destroyed me were the story of two chars in particoular, I will put under SpoilerEmil & PascalKnowing a bit of the story of the first I mentioned, well... It's sad...Actually he is still alive accoringly to the story even if You finish the sidequest so, all good :D infact You can find him again on his syuper cool tricicle-thing XDThe argouments like life, death, be Yourself or not to be anymore if You change something in Your body, it makes You think, a lot, may be just me but I just wanted to let You knowProblems: Most of the players on PC had problems with crashed and white screensSo far I had my PC turned on since January (over 60 days) and I got, as far as I remember, 5 white screens and only 1 actual game crash, luckily I am used to save a lot so I basically never lost anything, except for few minutes of game maybe, but so far it was quite ok, I rebooted only after finishing it, but being at 100% I didn't tested it again, maybe in the future :)The resolution problem, that bothered me the most because I wanted to play full screen, I have a GTX 780 and still whatever I do I always mantain 60 FPS, so, yeah, it's not an heavy game even pushed to the limit, I would like to try again when the resolution will be fixed so maybe it will be proper 1080p, so maybe it will be actually a bit heavy when it will be rendered properly, just my assumption anyway, only time will tell :)Mouse and Keyboard: I don't like to use controller but I had to in this case (last time I used one was probably 2010 or even earlier) this just because of the Evade system which on K&M lacks a dedicated key and in this game Evade is basically this: Evade = Immortal, double tap on the K&M is not working very good because You can't chain the evade movements, hopefully this will be fixed, and the shooting with POD is not very feasible in some situations where You should keep ""dragging"" the mouse to make the POD rise or lower the fire (I don't want to spoiler so I will just stop here)I probably need to write a lot more but overall, in the actual situation, my score would be something like 8/10When everything will be fixed (even if they don't fix K&M but just the white screen) it will go 9/10Still it miss something, some more in-depth on certain aspects or something that I would have changed into the story because as said one of the char was basically a pure hate for me, the playstyle too of that char was not very interesting and super boring, the thing about need more in-depth is not story wise, I just would like to have more contents, more story, something more to watch and listen, I really enjoyed the argouments and the story, reallyAlso would be cool to add a survival mode: all the enemies against You in an infinite sequence, even 2-3-4 bosses together, it would be quite cool to be honest as said when You are at the end of the last ending You will be most likely 99 like me and basically everything You touch will be destroyed instantly, so yeah would be cool to have an arena like that(not the Debug mode the game gives You in the main menu, don't really like that XD)			"

												Just finished with my first playthrough of this game, and, I must say. This is the first game in quite some time, which I feel as though I can just sit and play it for hours on end. That nostalgic feel from childhood, when you had a video game you were dying to play, and then you played it all day and night. Wonderful game. I do indeed recommend it, if you're a fan of single player story games. Tons of replayability in this title, as well.			"

												I am amazed and positively stunned by the game (I have never played or even heard of the other Nier-games before). It looks great, the characters are fantastic and the world is perfectly sculpted to give you the exact feel you need to get drawn into the story. It is not just some open world to explore, it is a world where every step makes you feel that whatever war you think you are fighting there is ultimatively futile and not worth going for. And yet the nature and growth everywhere makes it clear that no matter what happens, life will go on and that there is always a future. A solid 10/10 from me and possibly one of the games I will remember and come back to for many years to come.			"

												Great game so far, but the PC port could be better. The port isn't terrible, but the reported widespread issues are present (as of launch, will update when patches are released).running at 1080p on high, there have been no fps issues on my machine. (8GB RX480, FX-8300, 16GB RAM)I did have to rollback my GPU drivers to stop crashing, but that's only if you have an RX400 series card.The upscaling res bug can be bypassed with windowed mode or borderless via a 3rd party app, but that really needs to be fixed, like, very soon. At least the game itself plays well, even if the cutscenes are at 30fps.Hopefully later I can talk more about how great the game itself is, rather then where the PC version falls short. It's good enough to the point where I'm not refunding it, but if you're skeptical, you might want to wait for a patch or two.For AMD users, the driver I rolled back to was 16.11.5.			"

												Going over the PC port first since Steam users are autismo about that.-Game supports up to 1080p, it can go higher res but that's not natively supported.-Framerate caps at 60.-Game does not have a borderless windowed option, took me about 20 minutes of crashing to get working with a workaround.-Supposedly the game has resolution issues? Works on my machine. GTX970 meme card and i5 4690K at 3.5GHz.Overall it's pretty w/e, mostly servicable.The game itself is fantastic. I'm not some bandwagoning loser who hopped on the Taro train for Automata or Drakengard 3. Played the original Drakengard in 2005 and bought Nier when it first came out in 2010. This is probably the most refined Yoko Taro's games have ever felt and SE should apologize to me personally for not giving him a budget. After the disaster known as Drakengard 3 I was somewhat skeptical about how the game would turn out. Gameplay:Despite being made by Platinum, gameplay definitely feels more like a sequel to Nier, with some flair. Rather than just mashing attack, you mash light and heavy attacks, pod for your magic/bullets, and a mediocre dodge function. Outside of combat, you explore an open area and fish/do sidequests/farm items. Pretty much like the original. Magic is interesting since you can bind up to 3 programs at a given time and swap between them when you find more pods. Boss fights are hit/miss. Sometimes you get something really cool and a lot of time you get something along the lines of a giant roboworm in the sky pooping out ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bullets and he hardly ever gets down. I really wish they expanded on boss fights but there are still good fights! Enemy variety is a bit low but since most people were deepthroating Breath of the Wild that shouldn't be an issue for you.Story:Gonna pair this with characters. The story wasn't as good as the original Nier, and the original does build up to this. Despite it not being directly related, there are many tie-ins to the original game that many people will miss. That's what you get for being a bandwagon cuck. It starts off on an interesting premise and takes a wild turn after the second ending. Many of the concepts and ideas Taro had while working on the game are great, but it just lacks the chemistry the original game had with it's cast and chain of events.Graphics????:It's a ♥♥♥♥ing Yoko Taro game what did you expect retart. Characters were designed by Akihiko Yoshida and I want all of the girls to sit on my face. Variety in regions is pretty good too, less grey than the original Nier. Still pretty grey. I don't know it looks fine. No blinding bloom like the original either.Controls:PLATINUM HAS A GAME WHERE YOU CAN FULLY BIND THE CONTROLLER WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥. I mentioned this before but dodge feels unsatisfying, that's my biggest complaint. Moving around the map feels good and combat mostly feels good and the shooting mechanic is pretty good. People hate on the lack of a lock-on on harder difficulties but honestly the lock-on isn't all that good and maybe you should stop being bad at games.Overall the game is great, and while Platinum did a wonderful job with the gameplay elements, I really don't feel they were the sole reason why the game turned out so well, and I see a lot of Platinum fans being disappointed with the game because ""muh hype muh cuhrayzeeeeeeeeee game muh muh muh"" and overall just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ up another community. It honestly feels like a Sequel to Nier in essentially every aspect. Go buy the game already jesus christ.*I originally played the game on PS4.EDIT: I ♥♥♥♥ING LIED BROS THE GAME RUNS LIKE ♥♥♥♥ ON MY 970 WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ SO MUCH FOR THE MASTER RACE I PAID $1000 FOR THIS PC DEFEND THIS ♥♥♥♥ PCUCKS REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEBUY THE GAME ON PS4 INSTEAD.

												HOKAY So let's start with how much I've played through so far: I've done a couple side-quests, completed the first run through the story and ran around aimlessly for a good amount of time without being bored. The game still has more to offer, after your first playthrough you get a secret message as well that will explain more of what I mean. For newcomers, yes there is no auto-save, no it is not a bug that you cannot save for the first little while. It's aka. git gud, :^) I don't run the best computer so I could only run the game at a measly 1360 x 768 to play it at 60fps at medium levels, but even then the graphics are absolutely stunning and beautiful. I was able to load it into 1080p and max settings just to have a brief moment to look at some scenery and my goodness I've never loved a place in a video game so much in my life. The story itself is marvelous, after the first completion I couldn't (and still can't) get the fuzzy happy feeling out of my chest. The gameplay is creative and fun as it transitions into all sorts of styles which I actually love love love. Although if you figure out a strategy there are some battles that become time consuming rather than fun interactive battles, but that's what the difficulty changes are for. All in all the battle system is very fun to experience. tl;dr Pros: Graphics - Story - Characters - Gameplay Cons: ohno no auto-save - open world might make things a little confusing - whattheheck i can't do some things in the first playthrough my new favorite game, and I hope to keep up with more of Yoko Taro's work in the future. Time to experience more playthroughs ~			"

												A large amount of care has been put into NieR and it's replayability and fun factor is definately up there, might need to install a borderless software to play it at native resolution but that wasn't worth degrading it's value, overall it's fun, fast paced and got plenty of things to do, the sidequests also formulate to something of a mini-main quest that you won't see unless you are speeding through it. Graphics arn't everything when it comes to gameplay, and NeiR makes a beautiful map out of what it has, some edits to remove some needless invisible walls would be preferred in my opinion but it is fun never the less. The soundtrack is amazing. Lots of different weapons to suit your playstyle. Have tissues on hand. 10/10Truths:There is no borderless full screen but software can help with that.Don't trust other player's comments with less than 3 hours of gameplay.Myths:many people have been complaining about FPS drops, but it's down to their system, not the game itself.

												Regarding the game:Done with most of the game ! Gameplay's fun, mechanics in general are awesome (death penalties; perspective swap from 3D to 2D, top-down; etc), side-quests are greatly done and you can tell how much attention to detail they've put into this game; you even get beautiful bgm cues when you're doing side-quests ! And most of them are voiced over ! (so far, at least) I could be here all day praising this game for its story, bgm, characters, scenarios, art, gameplay mechanincs, battle system and much more, really.Optimization:While the base game is wonderful, I obviously can't ignore some flaws regarding its optimization. For me, it's great, I haven't experienced any crashes so far, but :- Sometimes the game fails to catch up with you and loads the textures for the scenario way later, I just give it some time- Some hiccups caused by the loading of the area (hasn't happened while battling to me, yet)- The game's resolution doesn't match the 1080p setting if I go full screen (it downgrades to 900p) *I'm using Kal's mod for now. I hope they patch it !I'm so glad the PC version happened. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. Taro Yoko, Okabe Keiichi, Emi Evans, J'Nique Nicole, Naim Nakagawa, Platinum Games, Squeenix et al <3 THANKS FOR MAKING THIS HAPPEN !			"

												AMAZING GAME! First game in YEARS that I  haven't regretted Purchasing at full price. The game is INCREDIBLE period. The music is amazing, very immersive one minute its an anime rpg, then bullethell, then side scroller,  then platformer then open world. Using my Skills for missions other than fighting is refreshing...""the robot race side quest"". Love how the world opens up, at first I thought it was bland and too much greys and washed out green but as you play the game only gets better and the aesthetic works its grows on you and becomes more captivating. Water effects are very well done. Controls arre very responsive. Using both analog sticks while in the middle of combat is new but very natural and now I can't get enought of this twitch style of play. 2B looks amazing and moves like a woman possessed she owns the battlefield no matter how massive the opponent and they do get pretty BIG!!! The nuances in this game make it a breath of fresh air!  Very much satisfied with this purchase. INCREDIBLE GAME. I am only a few hours in but I hope there are unlockable costumes somewhere would to love mess around with that option.....and a Gameplay Tip ::  Many have comlained about the windowed mode, window play etc...I go into the Steam folder find the NIER folder, find the NIER exe file right click and run with my GTX1060 Card no issues after that.....HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDUpdate 31MAR...There is an item that drops down a curtain to change costumes. Bought it from Emil...Got what I asked for! Different Costumes!!! Now to Find'em....Perhaps Fishing? I mean I found another POD this way now I have 3.....This game is full of suprises!			"

Wonderful is an understatement. The soundtrack is perfect and fits with the setting. Speaking of the setting... IMMERSION. As soon as you finish the tutorial and get into the city, you will get this calming feeling as you explore around with the soundtrack. Definitely recommend a controller for this game. As a die hard Kingdom Hearts fan, I feel right at home playing this game. Everything about it reminds me of the KH series. Feels like an open world version of it.

Fight Mechanics (Each weapon synergizes with eachother smoothly, the countering makes every fight interesting).5. Voice Acting (Pretty decent work, nothing seems out of place, I went with the japanese voice overs).6. Map (Not the biggest open world game out there, but its definitely filled with secrets to explore).7. Difficulty (Believe me when I say it is near impossible to do the epilogue of the game on HARD, but it's still a fun challenge).That's all I could probably think of right now, but I definitely would recommend this to anyone i'd meet for sure. Developers took their good time with this game, and it really shows, though only annoyance i've seen so far is the invisible walls that you'll run into, can't complain though with the amount of content i'm seeing.

												This game has really satisfying combat, a great soundtrack, an interesting story, and a ♥♥♥♥ ton of replayability. I've played through this game and have gotten all the endings except for one (Y) and i must say all the story-related endings make it so worth it for multiple playthroughs. When replaying through it isnt even the same game. Each playthrough starts out completely different from the last, so theres plenty of content to be had. The relationship between the characters and their commanding officers as well as between the three themselves is nice to learn about as you go through the game. There are a lot of archives of information you can find and side-quests that give backstory as well. Would definitely reccomend buying this game.			"

												WOW, this game is really something else, Story 9/10, Combat 8/10, Music 10/10, Action 10/10, Animation 10/10, for me this game was purely amazing and I am so glad i spent that £40 to play this masterpiece of an exclusive. For me this game is a 9/10, its beautiful and really unique. The only CON for me personally would be the saving, Im used to autosave but this game has the ""find the special save location"" and sometimes I forget to save before a boss battle and once I die it takes me quite a bit back :D but that didn't stop me from enjoying this sleep depriving game. The best part is that once you complete it once there are more ending to get if you start again, soooooo yeah I am deffinatly looking to spend a hell of a lot more hours on this game. Oh and a bonus are the side quests <3 Highly reccomend this game if you love action packed hack and slash games, and not to mention the main character (2B) is beautiful AF, enough to make me develope an android fetish. So far I only got the Route A ending but I will most deffinatly get them all :D			"

												I stopped playing JRPGs a long while ago because of how boring they get, thought I tried this one and well this is probably the best one I've ever played in a while. If you hated Final Fantasy XV's story then this will cover for that. Aside from optimization issues, there aren't many noticeable cons in gameplay. So yes, this is totally worth your time.			"

												*No spoilers ahead* This is the best game I have ever played. It goes over a wide variety of controversial topics; mainly debaiting death and why we live. There is not much that can be said about this game without spoiling it, but what I can say is; make sure to play it ALL the way through,  and watch all the way through the ending credits. End Note: This game is a worthy sequel of its predecessor and I really appreciate the effort that was poured into its creation.			"

												Yoko Taro + Platinum Games. If you are familiar with Yoko's or Platinums previous titles you know that these guys combined are a gift from the heavens. Story was great, full of tension and twists. Gameplay was fantastic and tight. The characters animations are top notch. Music, oh the music. The music is something that I will be listening from youtube for a long time. If you are worried about not playing Drakengard or the previous Nier before this one, don't be. They are not heavily tied together. By watching a quick recap of the previous titles should get you up to speed with the references in the games world.All in all I had a blast playing Nier:Automata and I can fully recommend it to everyone thinking about buying it.

												9/10 - Best game in yearsNieR has been the ONLY game in the past year or two that has got me dying to play more, I try to get into games but I lose interest, like Tom Clancys Wildlands, For Honor, I got those two and played maybe 5-6 hours on each and got bored, but the past 4 days i've played 20 hours of NieR, deff worth 60$ and I hope they release DLC with either more character lines or just new area's.Plus who doesn't like seeing attractive androids wearing skirts and fighting machines with a giant katana!The camera angles can be a little weird at times to where im constantly having to rotate around, thats really the only downside that I could find.

Review: NieR: Automata 
A Video of NieR:Automata™
By: Kain Klarden

			Short review of an amazingly strange action RPG/shmup from Yoko Taro and PlatinumGames. Text review here: http://klarden.dumdoi.com/2017/04/thoughts-on-nier-automata/		


The time where Yoko Taro genius finally got a good game, courtesy of PlatinumGames.There are minor issues, both in terms of slight technical issues and some of the design decisions. And the game is, probably, a tiny bit less crazy then some of the previous Yoko Taro works. But it's still amazing in how effortlessly it changes gameplay all the time, while remaining fresh, surprising, enjoyable and unforgettable. And the soundtrack is just stunningly awesome.Just, don't expect it to be good because of what the game says and does. Be ready to feel through HOW it says and does. And be aware, that completing the game once is far from it being over.			"

												Completely amazing game. One of the best games I have played in awhile. Story is AMAZING. Sound/score is AMAZING. The only con I can even think of is the game is locked at 60 fps (not too much of an issue really) and the cinematics are 30 fps (not sure why) but honestly it is not bad at all. Totally recommend it for everyone. The combat system is so fluid and easy to pick up, but it allows for you to show some skill with dodging. But like I said before, the selling point is its deep and complex story and its AMAZING songs that go with the combat and zones. I freaking want to download the soundtrack and play it in my car. The story made me tear up, and the amount of hours I've spent already makes it well worth it. I'll be excited to see if any story DLC comes out (looks like it).			"

												My Personal Rating 9/10 because it can always be better than what it is now.The game is amazing the combat is smooth and unique. Takes a bit to get used to the controls but rather simple. I cannot express in words how amazing the graphics looks its beyond Phenominal. I don't understand where all this negative feedback is coming from the game not running, drops in FPS ETC sounds very much like personal user problems. I installed the game yesterday and just played it today for 2hrs runs perfectly. My PC specs are crap compared to some people posting theirs on here.Graphics Card. NVIDIA GeForce GTX950 2GBRAM: 12GBCPU: Intel Pentium G3220 @ 3.00GHZ (Stock CPU My PowerSpec Came With)Running the game at:1600x900 Full ScreenV-Sync OnAnti Aliasing x2Texture Filter x8Blur OffShadows MediumEffects HighAmbient Occlusion OffMy PC compared to probably all of you LMAO.

												In the first few minutes of gameplay you are already excited and even more with the beautiful protagonist, 2B. NieR: Automata is a crazy game for crazy people. When you face your first boss, you think: What the **** is that? Ah yes . . . The wonderful world of Yoko Taro.But let's put all jokes to another place.This game brings some new innovations that I never saw, let me explane which one.Platinum used a mixture of formulas with hack and slash, platform, Arcade, 2D, RPG and other elements; Let's consider which games of this type would be considered ""Mediocre"", where in this generation what matters is FPS and graphics of last generation - and it is worth nothing that it was a very risky recipe, but Platinum did its homework. Throughout the game, you feel that you are part of the game's plot. Congratulations to all Platinum staff who did a great job. I am grateful to have lived all these years to play this work of art. Master Yoko Taro, take good care of your health, because we need more games like this :) PROS: 1 - Great gameplay. 2 - Great Story. 3 - Good design of main characters. 5 - Amazing SoundtrackCONS:1 - Boring Open World2 - 2010 old Graphics 3 - A bit boring enemy DesignWhat more can I say. I'm glad PC can enjoy this masterpiece too. PS: Still sucks to be a Xbox player though.PPS: For real though, how do they feel that Scalebound (also a game by Platinum Games) got cancelled by Microsoft (♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s) and Nier: Automata got released.PPPS: Don't try to play this game with Keyboard and Mouse			"

												AMAZING GAME! First game in YEARS that I  haven't regretted Purchasing at full price. The game is INCREDIBLE period. The music is amazing, very immersive one minute its an anime rpg, then bullethell, then side scroller,  then platformer then open world. Using my Skills for missions other than fighting is refreshing...""the robot race side quest"". Love how the world opens up, at first I thought it was bland and too much greys and washed out green but as you play the game only gets better and the aesthetic works its grows on you and becomes more captivating. Water effects are very well done. Controls arre very responsive. Using both analog sticks while in the middle of combat is new but very natural and now I can't get enought of this twitch style of play. 2B looks amazing and moves like a woman possessed she owns the battlefield no matter how massive the opponent and they do get pretty BIG!!! The nuances in this game make it a breath of fresh air!  Very much satisfied with this purchase. INCREDIBLE GAME. I am only a few hours in but I hope there are unlockable costumes somewhere would to love mess around with that option.....and a Gameplay Tip ::  Many have comlained about the windowed mode, window play etc...I go into the Steam folder find the NIER folder, find the NIER exe file right click and run with my GTX1060 Card no issues after that.....HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDUpdate 31MAR...There is an item that drops down a curtain to change costumes. Bought it from Emil...Got what I asked for! Different Costumes!!! Now to Find'em....Perhaps Fishing? I mean I found another POD this way now I have 3.....This game is full of suprises!			"

												Gotta buy 1080ti to see that booty on High settingsUpdate: [After 100% achivements unlocked]I really DO NOT have any words to express my feelings right now. Absolute amazing. Amazing Gameplay.Amazing Story. Amazing Music.Amazing. Amazing. AMAZING!Some may find the combat system not really challenging, but it has it fun, it's not entirely hack-n-slash. Though the level gap really have huge impact. If you really looking for challenge, there is Very Hardmode for you to try :^). Story? It's simple but it's a whole new level of complex. It's just. . . ugh, you really have to play the game to know. Because if I explain it, it would really spoil the story. Though it wouldn't spoil, you know, like you can think of the story in the different ways. But simplify it's not really just about Androids fight Aliens kind of things, it goes deeper than that. But it is really, really great story. You don't really need to play any of prequel to understand. If you want you can watch lore summary on YouTube.MUSIC? OH MAN. NieR OST is out of this wolrd my friends. It's so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ good. I've really never spend whole day listening to game OST but NieR make it happens. Really have no word to say. ""Rays of life""? ""Vague Hope""? ""WEIGHT OF THE WORLD""???? The OST is just so good there is really no words can explain it. Oh man!Really I can't say anything much more about this game. It's absolutely a master piece that everyone, EVERYONE should try. Thank you for bringing this amazing game to PC, SquareEnix.SPOILER Ending [E] credits clearly has the strongest impact. Maybe just me but after making the message, I really just wanna cry.  "

												First off: I recommend this game to anyone. Don't let the internet only fretting over a characters ♥♥♥ distract you from the fact that this game is great in story, music, world and gameplay.Positives:- great soundtrack - took me 40h to complete (A-E, 97% quests)- good and satisfying battle system (dodging at the right time or using heavy attacks feels GOOD)- interesting design with perspective shifts- several fitting difficuties- good character design- fantastic story- if you are a completionist, you can't really miss anything - powerups allow for a specialized playstyle (like range? like tank? like glasscannon melee? all possiple)- other things i currently don't remembernow the negatives, or rather nitpicks, i encountered within my 60h of playing this game:- frames drop sometimes when entering a new area (gtx1070, for reference)- exploding enemies can spawn right in your attack in a certain area, which depending on the difficulty can end you without a chance- the pacing is partially off (meaning the game can slow down a little too much in certain parts and a particular quest involving the sandy lands is just stupidly tedious)- stumbling over small rocks, while being realistic, this feature feels like it serves no higher purpose other than being annoying- perfect dodge -> unwanted ranged counter killed me more often than it helped. infuriating- dark souls death system (1 time retrieve or else you lose the accumulated exp and power ups)and that is where bugs come in. It only happened once after 60h of playtime, but after a 4 hour exp grind just for fun, an explosive enemy pushed my body through a wall, making me lose the progress of those 4 hours since i can't retrieve my body through the wall...but except for those things its a solid game and probably my GOTY.Just ATM a little bit angry.i will edit in more, should i remember more things			"

												Okay, so I had to jump through a few hoops before I could get the game running properly (that is 3 hours of testing multiple display settings, uninstalling and updating drivers, uninstalling and rolling back drivers, getting Borderless Gaming because the game looks awful in fullscreen, etc.). But if we ignore these technical issues that will most likely be fixed some time after launch with a couple of patches, and we evaluate the game as an experience, then I do believe this will be a mostly positive review.Before I start I want to make clear that I did preorder the game, for Hype reasons, but I'm reviewing this not as a fanboy, but as a veteran gamer that paid full price and expects a game that was properly made and runs as expected. (Don't be fooled by my not so impressive Steam library, after gaming for about 20 years you tend to amass quite a bit of physical copy games and experience.This Game Is AmazingOf course, this kind of game will not be for everybody. It requires multiple playthroughs if you wish to get the most out of its story, and even though it doesn't require you to know the lore of the previous games, you'll want to go find out. (Especially with characters like Emil appearing out of nowhere) The best way I can describe this game is an Open World JRPG-like Hack 'n Slash Combat Based game.Think about a game not quite as open as Xenoblade (in world size or open-endedness, with standard sidequests and inventory management for a JRPG, with a combat system not quite as flashy/complex/difficult as Bayonetta, but similar (considering Platinum Games are responsible for delivering this title to us). This description alone is enough to get someone like me to have a nerdgasm, but it might actually drive quite a few people away from the game; people who are looking for simpler action and not so much story (a little like the DmC with emo Dante).StoryI won't dive too deep into the story to avoid spoilers. Even though my gameplay time proves I've not yet completed the game, the whole story has been revealed to me through Twitch streams and YouTube videos. The story revolves mostly around YorHa androids 2B and 9S, which have been assigned to help out the android resistance at Earth. Even though androids are not allowed to have feelings, by the end of the story progression you end up feeling for them yourself. They speak their minds and desires with surprising freedom if you take into consideration the fact that they are synthetic beings. The story itself is not the best I've come across, but several quirky moments and instances of comic relief make me grateful that Yoko Taro was the producer. Brilliant and unusual storytelling + good gameplay and combat = happy gamers.GameplayThe gameplay can be as complex or as simple as you wish it to be here. You can set it to easy and relax while the plug-in chips do most of the hard work for you and enjoy the story, or set it to hard or very hard and get yourself punished mercilessly if you did not do the necessary preparations for a fight. The multiple sidequests of the game are the generic ""go find this for me"", ""please find/save someone"", ""go kill these enemies"", ""go activate this"" quests found in most MMOs and RPGs. This is not necessarily a bad thing. It gives you time to take the world in and do some exploration on your own. Exploration allows you to find materials and objects that you can sell or use to upgrade your weapons, Pods and yourself. Plug-in chips serve the function of trinkets or the kind of buffs you would find in a piece of gear in another game. Each has a certain effect (movement speed, % of health recovered after killing an enemy, max health up, defensive and offensive boosts for both ranged and melee attacks, etc.). You can find or buy these chips, and fuse them together if they are the same type and tier to get a new one with stronger effects while taking less space. You have a certain amount of ""storage"" available for these chips which you can expand with in-game currency. Each chip will have a certain storage cost to prevent you from becoming too overpowered. Better chips will take up more space, of course. Players going through the game in easy mode will be able to install chips that perform certain actions automatically for them; such as shooting, dodging, and healing (this last one can be found and equipped in other difficulties as well). Boss fights are intense but not unfair. Sidequesting is not required but recommended if you intend to have  a not-so-hard-time with some of the fights. Leveling up is not so important, as you'll be fighting machines with a higher level than yours most of the time during the story anyways (but don't expect to be able to go up against a machine 30 levels higher than you and not get instakilled).Combat feels fluid, and OH MY GOD thanks for letting us cancel out of combos with a dodge. There is nothing worse than committing to a heavy strike and getting punished by another enemy before you even land the hit. The Pods are there as your support DPS source, but have multiple programs that can be installed to provide even more support or devstating attacks. Combat does not have the depth of a DmC game, but does not feel shallow or simple either.The open world can sometimes feel a little barren and washed out, but the story provides an acceptable explanation for this. As humans have fled earth, and plantlife and the elements have taken over once more. There is not exactly plenty to do everywhere, but at least there are lots of collectibles scattered anywhere you care to look. These will help you in one way or another, so your time spent climbing that building for 5 minutes won't be wasted.VisualsThis is not the most graphically impressive game you'll ever lay your eyes upon. This is no DOOM 2016 or Rise of the Tomb Raider. You can most certainly tell it's a console port when you see some of the textures up close. Render distance and aliasing are quite bad. The art direction, however, is superb. There is a big contrast at play here. Dark abandoned factories highlighted by pools of glowing molten metal, huge cities with nothing but the dilapidated builings for evidence that humankind once resided here, a vast desert with nothing more than the scorching sun reflecting on the dunes as you slide down through them, forests full of flora that blocks out the sky, and an amusement park with machines dancing as fireworks light up the horizon. I think you get the idea. The atmosphere is well structured, and the fact that 2B can run at a decent pace will help you feel that you're not going too slow but still allowing you time to take it all in. All of this accompanied by the perfect soundtrack for each area... speaking of which!MusicVocals are the new thing here. Keiichi Okabe's work here is brilliant. You know a soundtrack is good when you can't wait to be able to download it and keep in in your playlist for casual listening or to replace another game's soundtrack as you play (looking at you League of Legends). I can't help but feel that all the tracks were rather similar but had a definitive distinction between them. Sadly, except for Beauvoir, the music was never really used to complement the fights themselves. The music definitely fits the pacing of the fight, but the bosses don't move and attack along with the music. Superb soundtrack. Even if you never play the game I recommend everyone to listen to it.PerformanceHere's where everything goes south. To say that the PC launch was bumpy is an understatement. If they at least bothered making a demo for PC we could have noticed many of these problems right away and have them ironed out by launch date. As of now the game has some serious crashing and FPS issues on certain setups. Solid 60 FPS so far on my rig tho.I've run out of available characters for the review. My final score is 9/10 2B butts. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) "

Evolution of main characters throughout the game makes it so immersive to play, you'll almost fell like you're 9S or 2B. You can ""paste"" yourself in their body and feel that they're more like a human than just a machine. My verdict: 11H/10made non believer into real fanboy

												Regarding the game:Done with most of the game ! Gameplay's fun, mechanics in general are awesome (death penalties; perspective swap from 3D to 2D, top-down; etc), side-quests are greatly done and you can tell how much attention to detail they've put into this game; you even get beautiful bgm cues when you're doing side-quests ! And most of them are voiced over ! (so far, at least) I could be here all day praising this game for its story, bgm, characters, scenarios, art, gameplay mechanincs, battle system and much more, really.Optimization:While the base game is wonderful, I obviously can't ignore some flaws regarding its optimization. For me, it's great, I haven't experienced any crashes so far, but :- Sometimes the game fails to catch up with you and loads the textures for the scenario way later, I just give it some time- Some hiccups caused by the loading of the area (hasn't happened while battling to me, yet)- The game's resolution doesn't match the 1080p setting if I go full screen (it downgrades to 900p) *I'm using Kal's mod for now. I hope they patch it !I'm so glad the PC version happened. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. Taro Yoko, Okabe Keiichi, Emi Evans, J'Nique Nicole, Naim Nakagawa, Platinum Games, Squeenix et al <3 THANKS FOR MAKING THIS HAPPEN !			"

												Let me start by saying, I was very apprehensive going into this game. I was reading reviews all last night while installing the game (slow internet, took me hours to install). The amount of negative reviews that were flooding in about the game not playing well/crashing and what not was very concerning.That being said. I have just beat the first main boss and made it to being able to save the game. NieR:Automata has run flawlessly on my PC (system specs will be at the end of this review). The gameplay is absolutely amazing. I am using a wireless Xbox 360 controller. And I love that I can customize my controls for it. That is something that is missing from a lot of ports. Swapping around my Action, Evade and Fire buttons made everything feel Right. The graphics are really nice and everything is running smooth for me in maxed out settings. However, I do have Blur turned off as I generally hate any kind of blurring effects in a game. The only negative I've seen so far is the 30fps Cutscenes. It gets jittery and takes away from the game because of that. The immersion just sort of dies for me when it goes to a cutscene.I am playing the game at 2560x1440 on a 144hz monitor. Game is locked at 60fps but still feels smooth. And I generally can't stand playing anything under 80fps because I notice the difference. I've been gaming at 144hz for 4 or 5 years now and 60fps is normally like 30fps was to me when I gamed at 60fps. I hope you follow that.Positives: Beautiful Graphics for a portSmooth gameplay with awesome CombatNever dips below 60fps during gameplayStory and immersion are great during gameplayThe couns is amazing so far as well. Loving the music and voice acting.Negatives:Cutscenes are locked at 30fps... This is the absolute most negative aspect of the game. As the frame drop causes stuttering during the cutscenes and, for me, it completely pulls me out of the immersion I have been sucked into fromt he actual gameplay.Locked at 60fps (Although it's actually really smooth, which is impressive. So this could be seen as a positive as well and is in no way a deal breaker, as I thought it might be before actually playing.)My System Specs:i7-5820k @ 4.7Ghz2x Nvidia Titan X in Sli (Maxwell) @1348mhz core (only one card is used during gameplay on this title, but Sli being on doesn't seem to negatively affect it at all)32 GB Crucial DDR4 @2400mhzSamsung Evo SSD game driveAsus G-Sync 2560x1440 @144hz MonitorI would definitely recommend this game.

												If you're looking to get NieR: Automata solely for android booty and/or Platinum combat you may either be sorely disappointed or pleasantly surprised by what you actually find yourself experiencing. NieR: Automata is the niche sequel to the niche first NieR game in the niche NieR series which is a spinoff of the niche Drakengard series (the games are pretty niche). While neither the first NieR nor the Drakengard series are required to be played to enjoy Automata, doing so will greatly enhance your experience and I'd strongly recommend that you at least familiarize yourself with the story of the first NieR and its connection with Drakengard before playing NieR: Automata (this will also help you decide if NieR: Automata is a purchase deserving of your time and money).  Whether you decide to take that plunge or not, avoiding spoilers would be something I'd also recommend. Now to get into why I'd personally recommend the game:PROS:-The gameplay is the best it has ever been for the series-The story is an emotional rollercoaster not quite like anything I've experienced before and a well deserved sequel to the first NieR-An absolutely incredible soundtrack that harkens back to the first game's, using its melodies and vocals for emotional impact as well as having entirely original songs that will leave their own new mark on you-One of the most profound moments I've experienced from a game in my nearly two decades of gaming (to say anymore would be spoilers)-Perspective and gameplay changes that keep things fresh and intense-Sidequests with great stories of their own-In keeping with the tradition of the series, multiple endings and further insights on repeat playthroughs that give you a reason to play through the game again-Countless ""little things"" that add to the overall experience CONS:-The PC port isn't the greatest at the time of writing (the community has already put out several fixes for various problems)-A gameplay mechanic introduced in the middle of the game can become somewhat repetitive-While the combat system is deep and fluid the game never requires or incentivises you (other than satisfying yourself with flashy combos) to expand past mashing light attack, holding down the fire button and spamming the incredibly forgiving dodge (at least on normal difficulty)-A somewhat bland but atmospheric open world setting-The sidequests are mostly menial fetch quests, gameplay wise-The English voice over isn't the best, in my opinion (luckily there's a Japanese voice option)While being rough around some edges, NieR: Automata is immensely greater than the sum of its parts. It's definitely left an impact on me, so much so that I've thought about the game non-stop since completing it and it's earned a spot as one of my favorite games of all time.			"

I was blown away. That's how I came to love NieR.After I heard there'll be a new game, I already knew I was going to love it. And thank god I was right.

												With:- Stunning visuals- BGMs - Fighting system of each individual androids- the difficulty level- Story- Voice Actorsyou can't definitely find an awesome game as good as this one. It's almost perfect, but I gotta agree with some people, that there's not much wardrobe material for the androids(Or if I may theorize why few clothes are customizable is because they ""might"" want to match it to the game's theme of ""black and white"" motif in fashion.Watching the dialogue in japanese makes it look like you're watching anime, which is actually impressive, knowing that the japanese voice actor and actresses of 2B, 9S, and A2 are outstanding seiyuus(voice actor) in the anime industry. And Yui Ishikawa's deadpan snarker voice for 2B really matches the latter's personality~For the story, it's quite interesting to play it yourself, because in this game, you can unlock 26 ENDINGS, the way you see it fit. So far I've only unlocked three so far, which is quite interesting in my pace(since I did it in just 2 days). Of course, that is, if you're the type of person who is impatient to relive tons of re-playing events that you already finished.For music, EVERY MUSIC in this game has the good mix in the atmosphere per area. I also especially liked Pascal's Village the most, as they used a BGM with kids' voice in it-- which you can feel that Pascal's village is something like a kid's paradise and making it more friendly.Lastly, I would like to say thanks to the staff of Nier:Automata. I've never played any Nier franchise before this one, but this game really brought back myself to cherish gaming again. Buying it is really worth it. I hope this gets an impressive sequel despite having already 26 endings in one gameTwT			"

A Very Welcome SurpriseOn my list of top ten games I've played, this definitely ranks on number four behind Radiata Stories and Final Fantasy X, and Warcraft 3, which for me is very high praise considering my wde array of games I've played to completion. At first, I thought this game wasn't going to be great, since I had never heard of Yoko Taro nor his works, so this came very much out of the blue for me. I paid it very little attention, and I'll admit, most of that was for 2B's butt, until about a week from launch, when one of my friends got it for the PS4. Out of humor, I watched him play the first portion of the game, and wasn't entirely amazed; it had the look of everything I'd come to hate in games: an overblown romance, very little substance beyond the combat, and an open world. Boy, was I wrong.A few days before launch day, I drunkenly, and probably spurred on by the friend who got it on PS4, got a copy for it. Not really wanting to pay full 60 for it, but having already done so, I planned on doing the two hour demo and just refunding it.The alarm I set for just under two hours buzzed and I turned it off. I was so enthralled with this game that I don't even remember doing so. Within an hour and fourty five minutes, I was already hooked into this pretty little game. Everything melded together so well - story, combat, art, voice acting (I played English, and the line delivery was fantastic for all characters, save a few specific lines, though the Japanese were their usual quality of fantastic as well,) and the atmosphere. So, I'll cover them in the order I've listed, for simplicity.StoryUnfortunately, for all the right reasons, I can't go too deep into the story, so let's make this the skim milk of reviews. The story is absolutely fantastic in every respect. It's deeper than what you expect in the first two playthroughs, but shallow enough to not need to go back to the previous games to get into it. It's truly fantastic, especially with some of the late game scenes, which can bring every emotion forward.Oh, yeah, I almost forgot.THE STORY DOESN'T BEGIN UNTIL THE THIRD PLAYTHROUGH.That was important because I almost put it down after the second, but decided on continuing. Moving on,Combat2B, A2, and 9S, all the characters you play, have very distinct fighting styles. 2B and A2 share the same moveset, but they differ in how quick they are. 2B is agile in every way, able to strike quicker, and A2 is weightier and feel far more impactful (I have been told this is complete false, but to me the two seem entirely different while sharing the same moveset. So bugger off.)9S, though, has a unique combat style. While lacking in a heavy attack like A2 and 2B, he has hacking, which is borderline overpowered and, overall for me, out of place in how well it works. It takes you to a top down bullet-hell twin stick where the objective is to shoot the enemy's ball(s). If you fail, you lose maybe 10% of your health (Never tested this in the hardest difficulty to see if it kills you,) while if you win, you deal AT LEAST 25% of the enemy's health.The difficulties range from Easy (game literally plays itself), normal (fairly easy,) hard (more of a normal difficulty than Normal,) and the hair pulling out one shot mode. I personally recommend it on Hard after you realize what your playstyle is. Also, a minor nitpick is that I wish there were more varied enemies outside of bossfights. You see the same 10 or so types everywhere, and it gets dull after a while when you learn their percise behavior. ArtThis game is bloody beautiful. It takes the whole idea of ""what if Humans got driven from Earth for a few thousand years, yet somehow the buildings still stand?"" to a new level. The city you're in is never specified, it's simply City Ruins, though it is within the northern hemisphere and, I personally think Greenland based on a cutscene. But you'd never know it, because the four biomes - City Ruins, Forest, Desert and Underground are all within spiting distance of eachother.The weapons in this game are weaponporn. Pure and simple. If you like the old gritty weapons, they got that for you. Beautiful weabo swords? They got that too. Want sexy kawai girls? We got that apleanty. Want a cute little femboy? We got one of those in stock yesterday!Put simply, this game never got to be a sore on the eyes, since each place was so drastically different from the last that, even after almost 50 hours, nothing ever looked more than familiar, and if you look in all the nooks and crannies, it gets even better, since there's some gorgeous views hidden away.Voice ActingAlways a most controversial topic among nerds is to dub or sub. Well, I can say that for me, and a lot of others, the English dub is spot on in -almost- every situation. There are a few lines that are very much out there, and some where the VAs were obviously not having a good day, since the tone convayed was a bit... Diluted. But to be fair, for every bad line, it had at least two or more good to great ones to make up for it. 9S, especially near the end of the game, portrays a lot of that.Atmosphere.This game is about androids on a world familiar to us without us. You will explore it with the eyes of someone who knows it, while behind the eyes of someone who doesn't entirely. It feels lonely. It feels dark. But it has light moments as well, and the occasional comic relief.The atmosphere of living where people once did, without seeing any signs of violence not left in the current year, is deeply disturbing at some points. The machines also make this point far more abundant. In Yoko Taro's style, it's truly unsettlingly creepy on some of its basest levels, and it's that that brings the whole game together for the better.Easily my game of the year. 9.5/10. Only problem is the frame dipping, which they've said they're patching. Get it. It's worth it. "

												A beautiful, touching story, with plenty of tearjerkers and heart-wrenching little turns in it. One of the few games I've actually felt for the characters, but also greatly enjoyed the gameplay. Some technical issues like resolution scaling, but that doesn't get in the way.			"

												Nier Automata has been one hell of a ride. After of around 87 hours of playing the game and 6 sleepless hours after completing ending E I’ve concluded that this game is unlike any game that will ever come out.First off, the gameplay is made from the creators of Bayonetta and Metal Gear Rising fame, so it’s solid. The light attacks feel light and swift and the heavy attacks have impact to them. The dodge responds when it needs to and feels satisfying when done perfectly. The hacking games were hard at first but eventually you get used to the simple controls.The soundtrack and only be described as godlike. The previous game Nier also has an outstanding soundtrack but it suffers a bit because you can notice it only a single track that loops. With Nier Automata the soundtrack transitions into each other seamlessly that you’ll think it’s only one track playing continuously. The 8 bit tracks are excellent evidence of this. The game will transition to whatever is currently playing to the 8 bit tracts and back without losing its place.The highlight of this game will most undoubtedly be Ending E. Everything about this ending is unquestionably perfect. The song, the struggle, and the twist in your emotions as you realize what is happening. I will say that I have never experience a game quite like this that could stir emotions in me. The many games I’ve played have all been a one and done deal for me but this game will stay with me for a long time. "

												While some games have amazing story and others have amazing combat, this is one of those rare games which perfectly complements its great story , characters, level design , visuals , combat and sound track to create a rare gem of a game.Even after completing it I cant stop thinking about it which is very rare for many modern games. With this game and the original nier (which is a very underrated game too in my opinion), Yoko Taro has joined the ranks of people like Hideo Kojima and Hidetaka Miyazaki for me.This game will definitely be remembered as a classic in gaming world.That said no game is without its flaws and for me the major issue with the game is that Normal mode is too easy and Hard mode is brutal and enemies may kill you in one hit so there are some balancing issues that needs to be fixed.Optimization issues are present as well but the fan created mod fixes most of them.I will definitely remeber this game for a long time to come.P.S. it took me 37 hours to complete the game but steam is showing 16 hours for some reason.

												I still remember randomly picking the first game for Xbox 360 back in the days..I didn't knew anything about it.. Didn't touch it for months after buying it.. But once I did.. I was blown away. That's how I came to love NieR.After I heard there'll be a new game, I already knew I was going to love it. And thank god I was right. NieR:Automata gives me the same joy I had with the previous title.+Good Story (Obviously won't spoil anything, but I really like it.)+An empty, yet beautiful world+Good Combat System+Great Characters (We all know 9S is the best.)+Amazing Soundtrack (Just like the first one.)+Fishing!I highly recommend it, it's worth it.You also don't need to have played the previous game to enjoy this one.But if you happen to own a console and want more, go for it. You won't regret it. "

												This game had nowhere near the budget of an AAA game (example ME:A which is a mess), yet it did not disappoint. PROS:The combat is straightforward and very smooth with a Steam Controller.The soundtrack is immersive and fitting for the game's atmospheric levels.The performance is acceptable, ~60FPS on a GTX 1060 & i7 7700K & 16gb DDR4 RAM.The story is engaging. If you liked MGSV TPP's storyline, then you'll most likely enjoy this one too.CON(S):The resolution is weird at 1920x1080, will most likely get fixed soon (a workaround is  Borderless Gaming) .			"

Good•	The game itself is fantastic, it has a lot going for it story-wise. Basically you’re an combat android tasked with dealing with machines that want to wipe out the human race. This is the type of game were you can’t really talk about to much because of spoilers and plot twists everywhere but from my experience it was unforgettable and I definitely recommend it to any fan of the RPG JRPG genre as well as anyone who really cares about how a story is told.•	The combat in this game is awesome and Platinum really outdid themselves with how smooth the transition between weapon combos and how tactical you can get with the upgrade system in-game.  The enemies are pretty much different versions of the same 4 or 5 types but there are some unique ones in there and because of the story it actually makes sense that that would be the case making it feel less repetitive and more routine.•	The graphics are alright really but nothing spectacular. There are some areas where important places are very well done but for the most part the character models, story and combat take center stage in this game. The world itself is open world-ish.. (areas unlock) with side quests scattered around keeping you busy.•	The gameplay doesn’t stay repetitive long, it switches between play styles every now and then to keep you on your toes, something you find out within the first few minutes of playing.The Bad•	Glitches all over the place for just about anyone with a card under a gtx 970. White screens, freezes, fps drops, blurry fullscreen, you name it this game has it for a portion of gamers. There are community fixes but you should probably make sure they work for you before purchasing just in case.•	The enemies do become a bit repetitive hours in because the large majority of them are just the same models with different weapons and colors so later in the game once you’re higher level you may find yourself ignoring a lot of them. Even if the game itself tries not to stay repetitive the enemies do.•	A lot of running around collecting things for side-quests. Unless you’re like me and like to grind the basic side-quest is “go kill this so I can have this”SummaryIn all I had an absolutely amazing time playing this game glitches and all; over 100 hours and about 20-30 freezes and I still love this game. The story is one of the best I’ve seen in my years of gaming and the combat was very fun. I found myself wanting to know more about all the side characters and I definitely got emotionally attached to the main ones; you won’t walk away apathetic in the least. Personally, I will definitely be playing this again in the near future but for now I am satisfied with my experience and recommend it without hesitation because of the story but cautiously because of the performance issues.

												Please don't be the guy who gets the A ending and immediately goes to complain on the forum about length. This game should be taken at its word when it says you should playthrough more than once. If I am to be honest the A ending really only caps off a prologue if anything.Those of you who have gotten to ending E will get the following sentiment.We're all in it together.			"

												All performance issues aside, this is a great example of what a game should be. The first wasn't as polished, but this iteration of NieR, while not a direct sequel (not that it needed one) is much more polished than the first, and should just be experienced by anyone who loves games for their core adventure.

Lots of fun hacking and slashing, feels and feels, and that soundtrack, my god it flows so well with the specific areas you're in and whatever's the situation, hats off to the guys who made that OST!Cons:The port to PC isn't the best, out of the box in full-screen mode there are issues with resolution (I have a 1440p monitor and even when 1440p is selected in the settings it ends up looking like 900p or something). In-game AA absolutely murders FPS, I recommend disabling it and use the AA solution that AMD or NVIDIA Settings can offer. To get the best out of performance in this game you need FAR (Fix Automata Resolution), look it up on the Steam Community. That will fix resolution problems and potentially some other performance issues too, so after that with that combined I can pretty much max out the game on 1440p @ 60fps 95% of the time (i5 3570k, 16GB RAM, R9 390 OC'd). But still, shouldn't need to resort to third-party patches to fix performance/resolution issues in the first place.TL;DR Yoko Taro pulled off a damn masterpiece, just to keep in mind that this isn't a perfect PC port though.

												This is one of my favourite games ever. Nier was already one of my favourites, and this just tops it in almost every regard. Nier was a flawed, clunky game, that managed to be deeply thought-provoking with so much soul that it's pretty hard to mention almost anything negative about it. Nier:Automata fixes the clunkyness. The result is a masterpiece that will probably go down in history as one of the games I point to if I need examples of greatness.Unfortunately I encountered multiple freezes, setting me back a few hours because there's no autosave, so I hope that gets patched. I actually like that there's no autosave, but not when it freezes.			"

												A little rough around the edges but I'd put that down to Japan lacking experience in developiong for the PC as a platform, the game itself however is...unique.  if you judge each aspect of it on its own you might think its a bit naffvisually it swings from being decent to looking like a dogs ♥♥♥♥ and the combat lacks the depth of some of platinums previous outings, however the way how it all comes together is something truly special, its a game that rewards your time invested in it and needs multiple play through's to enjoy.  Each run is very different from the last both from a story and gameplay perspective and when you hit run 3 the game goes off the ****ing chain and is a completely different game entirely. I have never been so moved by an ending to a video game as much as I have just been through Ending E of N:AThe final battle, the helping hand, the chorus, The ramifications of failure, I actually started welling up as I pushed on.In the end I helped someone.N:A isn't so much a game; its more of an experience.

												If I were to grade Nier Automata against other action RPGs I would give Nier a B+, in comparison to Skyrim and Witcher III which would get A+'s. Nier Automata is a fun, action-packed game with a lot of uniqueness that boarders on quirkiness. For example, the game depicts sexuality in many ways, just look at B2's short skirt and white panties, but never goes so far as a sex scene like Witcher III. There are also a plethora of childish, goofy-looking robots populating the Nier Automata world, along side scarier looking, more serious bosses. One of the things I appreciated about the Witcher III world was the cohesiveness and seriousness of the storyline. In Nier Automata there is a wide mixture of adult themes coexisting with kiddy comic relief. All in all that was my biggest pet peve with the game. The game delivers both a serious and comical atmosphere, which may be appreciated by some, but I prefer my games to have a serious and adult storyline and art style. Interestingly, Nier Automata is a game that must be replayed several times. After beating the game you will be invited to play through the game again as a different character, experiencing their story and abilities. I am currently on my second pass through the game and I enjoy getting more of the story by experiencing the game through the eyes of a different character who's missions sometimes overlap with the original character's, but often diverg into completely different missions and different areas. The gameplay in Nier Automata is fun and action packed. It behooves you to think strategically and master your build and combos, but simple button mashing will also work to a degree. I felt the game was a lot of fun, but button mashing was more viable than in Witcher III and less viable than Skyrim, if that gives you an idea of the technical skill required in combat. Overall I would say:Gameplay: Very good if you like action RPGs and light combos. Graphics: Very good, but could have been better. It is obvious that this game was a port from PS4. The port is a good one, but the graphics were not tweeked to accomodate powerful PC rigs and what they can handle. The FPS is also locked at 60 FPS. Story: The story is quite good, but with too much comic behavior, art, and style from the robots. If robots conquer the earth I expect them to be serious-looking. There is lots of replay value given that you can beat the game along various characters and story lines. Music/Sound Effects: Very good, as you would expect from a Tripple A title from Square Enix.So is it worth $60? If you like story RPG games like Witcher III you will like this and should buy it. If you are not into open world games with sexy fighting androids who combo you should wait for a sale or not buy.			"

Yoko Taro and Platinum come together in a perfect storm to make one of the best games everIn a world where gaming often feels uninspired and repetitive, NieR: Automata comes and breaks the rules and delivers an experience that feels entirely new in all areas. The story and plot is incredibly captivating and connected with me like few games have. The genre-mashing combat is insanely fun with a smooth hack and slash backbone combined with authentic feeling bullet hell moments. The overall graphics style is breath taking in parts and combined with an amazing soundtrack the presentation is endearing. This is easily one of the best games I've played in recent years and possibly one of the greatest games of all time.StoryNieR: Automata follows the story of androids 2B and 9S, who are part of Operation YoRHa that seeks to reclaim the world from machines. The story develops through understanding the greater context of the world and empathising with different perspectives. There are many different meanings, endings, tales and emotions explored throughout the game and most of them connected with me in a way that is incredibly rare in the industry. Only a handful of games have had such a powerful emotional and cognitive connection, but none have done it so regularly with most story elements. The relationship between the main characters has a great level of development, especially considering the amount of direct dialogue between them is not that large. What results is an almost unspoken synergy that develops naturally and feels very organic. Dialogue with supporting characters is great as well, with a mixture of very funny and incredibly sad moments. Something that NieR: Automata does very well is expanding character's history without overloading the player, this results in the player gradually learning about these characters and keeps the plot/quests very interesting. Just as an aside, I have not played the original Nier. Before starting the game I watched a summary of the original, in saying that the connection between the games is minimal with only a couple of references here and there. I would still recommend watching a summary of the original game, though not entirely necessary.GameplayTaro's games have not typically had great gameplay, which is why I was so excited to hear that Taro and Platinum have worked together to make this game. With Platinum in charge of the gameplay I knew it would be in good hands. The gameplay of NieR: Automata is a mix of many genres, and surprisingly they are all a joy to play. The three main styles are 3rd person hack and slash action in true Platinum style, twin stick shooter and shoot 'em up/bullet hell with several other styles sprinkled throughout. The hack and slash combat is an absolute blast as would be expected. Throughout the game I never once got tired of the combat and executing seemingly infinite combos with perfect dodge counters is incredibly rewarding. The different weapon types change the combat styles and a combining these weapons makes for an enjoyable and visceral experience. The shoot 'em up moments are surprisingly very great. I was a little hesitant when I knew the game had these moments and feared it would be a lame gimmick, I am very glad I was wrong. The gameplay during these parts feels very traditional which is great.The only thing that I didn't really like was the difficulty settings. There are 4 settings: Easy, Normal, Hard and Very Hard. Easy is very customisable with optional auto controls (such as dodge) this setting is for people who don't particularly care for the gameplay and is a cool addition. I played on Normal, and I found it to be too easy mostly because I always seemed to be overleveled, I only died a few times. Hard however was a really large step up above Normal, and when I tried it I got pretty stomped even by lowly robots. Very Hard says that you die in one shot, I didn't test it, but I assume it actually means that which would make the game almost impossible (not my taste but glad it exists). I think the game could've really done with an enemy level scaling option and my qualms about the difficulty would've been basically invalid, my next playthrough will definitely be on Hard. PresentationIt's very hard to talk about the graphics of this game. On one hand the overall detail and quality is quite low, particularly in some environments mostly due to poor textures. On the other hand the style of the game is great and reminds me a lot of Shadow of the Colossus, there are many beautiful zones and moments in the game and overall I love the graphics of this game. Whilst the level of detail might not be the greatest the style is definitely king. The combat and movement animations are incredibly smooth despite the 60fps cap, the facial animations were slightly above average I'd say. Cutscenes are unfortunately rendered in low resolution (900p@30fps I believe) and this did detract from these moments and I would've preferred to see them rendered in native resolution.The soundtrack is incredible, and as soon as it is released I will be buying it. The most notable tracks feature an incredible choir that are an absolute joy to listen to. Battles are generally done with instrumentals only except in key moments and boss battles, the music added a lot to the game especially in boss battles and exploration.""I see a bunch of games on the shelf, but I don't get as excited as I used to. I gave it some thought why am I not excited? The number of well made games has increased, but at the same time the number of games that makes my heart beat and give the feeling of ""I have no idea what to expect"" that excitement has gone down. [...] I want to strongly believe there is still a huge potential for games.""-Yoko Taro, 2014 "

												Okay now, this game I'm really lost for words. The sound track is amazing, I do not get tired of listening to the music this game brings with it. To me there is clearly good character development, the main character 2B goes from a strict millitary person to someone who slowly becomes more and more willing to give up her past ideaologies. The idea behind this apocoloptic world and the time it is set in is near perfect for my taste. The replay value of this game is also very high, offering different endings (26, from what I assume) that you can achive, and allowing you to follow through the story behind a different character. Visuals are great, although there is currently a bug that affects fullscreen mode in 1080 that is being fixed. The first playthrough offered me nearly 20 hours of entertainment and now going through the second time following a differnt character I assume will bring me the same amount, or more hours of enjoyment, considering that following different characters can also effect the amount of time it take to complete the game. Oh and lets not forget that this game is open world, offering you a wide variety of side quests to follow in many different enviorments.

On the other hand the style of the game is great and reminds me a lot of Shadow of the Colossus, there are many beautiful zones and moments in the game and overall I love the graphics of this game. Whilst the level of detail might not be the greatest the style is definitely king. The combat and movement animations are incredibly smooth despite the 60fps cap, the facial animations were slightly above average I'd say. Cutscenes are unfortunately rendered in low resolution (900p@30fps I believe) and this did detract from these moments and I would've preferred to see them rendered in native resolution.The soundtrack is incredible, and as soon as it is released I will be buying it. The most notable tracks feature an incredible choir that are an absolute joy to listen to. Battles are generally done with instrumentals only except in key moments and boss battles, the music added a lot to the game especially in boss battles and exploration.""I see a bunch of games on the shelf, but I don't get as excited as I used to. I gave it some thought why am I not excited? The number of well made games has increased, but at the same time the number of games that makes my heart beat and give the feeling of ""I have no idea what to expect"" that excitement has gone down. [...] I want to strongly believe there is still a huge potential for games.""-Yoko Taro, 2014 "

												This game is absolutely amazing. It is pretty much on a masterpiece level and is worth buying at full price.This is pretty much how games are meant to be done.What you get: An amazing JRPG styled story that touches some deep subjects.... and it does it a lot. The script, characters and quest-related narrative are very well crafted, characters are sympathetic, and I was genuinely interested what is going to happen next. There are frequent arcade sequences.Music is on a stellar level..Visuals...well, visuals on pc looks a bit rough around the edges, but for the purposes of this game they work well. The game could use a small performance boost as well. I played it with controller. I think there are keyboard bindigs provided, but I think that controller is the way to go with this title.Overall, the title reminded a lot about Ghost in The Shell, due to subjects it touches during storyline, and due to the music being used. The story gets quite dark on occasion too, which is good.The only minor complaint about this game is that there's a certain minigame, and you'll probably play this minigame a LOT. And this is pretty much the only issue.The main reason to buy this is music and story. Story is great, and there's lore and more stories everywhere in it. I gotta say that the guy responsible for this game is pretty much a genius. Stuff on this level is incredibly rare.So, highly recommended.			"

												I love this game and everything about it. Yoko Taro's stellar storytelling and Platinum brand gameplay will easily make this the sleeper hit of 2017 for me. This game is actually a sequel to the lesser known NieR that came out on PS4 in 2010, and is everything the first game was supposed to be, and more. The plot subtly deconstructs and explores the notion of what makes us human, while never being preachy and overly verbose about it. The characterization is top-notch, and you may even find a few poignant moments that may make you shed a tear(Especially THAT ending). The gameplay is a distilled essence of a less complex Bayonetta and a more in-your-face Metal Gear Rising:Revengeance. NieR Automata is going to be one of those blessed, profound experiences in life that you will think about now and then, and may stick with you until the day you die.			"

If you can look past the issues this port has, and they can be significant, this game will not only be entertaining in its gameplay, but keep you guessing on the story as well. Be forwarned, you may have to invest a hefty amount of time into the game to get a large amount of the story. Multiple endings and somewhat large changes in perspective across playthroughs will keep this game a more fresh experience than you may expect.

												To indirectly quote Jim Sterling, NieR:Automata is a piece of media that could only exist as a videogame. I have cried because of sadness, happiness and pain, but I cried for a reason I never thought I could cry for. I now understand why some art lovers cry when looking at a beautiful painting.You will never play a game quite like this one and I beg of you to support it in any way you can and spread the word.

												First experience with a Platinum game, as well as my first experience with a Yoko Taro game. The combination's left me absolutely blown away (and sometimes in tears- thanks Yoko Taro). The combat is extremely fluid and fun and the animations are fantastic. As well, the hacking/bullet hell elements lend a lot of variety to the game rather than it just being a simple hack and slash. The soundtrack is beautiful and ethereal, and the story is not only interesting but COMPLETELY wild. Wherever you're expecting this game to go when you start playing, you're probably wrong.The only real complaint I have is that Route B is somewhat repetitive, but Route C more than makes up for it in terms of story and gameplay.Unless you hate good gameplay, good music, and a good plot, you will love this game.Also, don't spoil yourself for the endings, you'll be kicking yourself later.

												I didn't know this game even existed until 2 days before it released on steam and I'm extremely impressed at itI'm running it with an i3 dual core processor and a GTX 760 GPU and it runs very smoothly for the most part. It looks gorgeous, maybe not as good as some of the screenshots but with my pretty sub-par graphics card I'm happy it runs at all. I've heard some people complain about the keyboard controls, personally I thought they were fine, they can get a bit clunky with aiming your pod (robo machine gun buddy) during 2d platforming bits but locking on to enemies tends to help thatGameplay is super satisfying and the story seems surprisingly deep, I haven't gotten that far in so far but I have high hopes for how it turns out. The bosses feel boss-y and the characters are pretty good imo, not the most complex in the world but they have more depth than your standard anime tropes and considering anyone considering buying this is a weeb anyways that should be a plusSo far I can't recommend this enough			"

												Solid Port, the only perfomance issue i got is ""Fullscreen"" doesn't really display true 1080 but instead of 900 but its a easy Fix simply play the game in windowed borderless, mind you i have a gtx1080 to run the game. The lock 60 FPS is fine for me cuz it never dips down below 60, the game just stay at solid 60 expect for cutscenes(30). Controls (Keyboard) at 1st its abit confusing cause most of the regular buttom's action are not the same compare to the norm, like shift is use for making the pod shot or srcoll down + arrow keys + E to quick heal your charater without going to the menu but abit of practice one could get a hang of it. Controls (Mouse) In the protion of the game where it forces you to view top down, the mouse moves at 45degrees increments making those portion of the game abit hard but not impossible to finnish. just simply rotate your mouse alot of times to target that specific enemy.The Game is a Beautiful combination of genres which is quite refresing and overwheliming FUN The SOUNDTRACK IS EPIC, hence it sits at 100% volume and will stay for the whole game.One last thing Try considering Japanese as the main dialouge cuz there's some VAs That also work in some famous animes, ahem Attack of titan Mikasa as 2b ahem and aoi yukki as.....

												So I was hesitant to write a review because I was sure it would be positive but then when the game released I experienced the low textures and the resolution bug like many other people - but as I got further into the game I didn't care about those issues anymore. You can immerse in the story, the combat mechanics are one of the best I have seen in a game, the love and detail put into the main characters along with the animations are highly enjoyable. If you are extremely sensitive when it comes to visuals then you should probably wait until there is an official patch to fix the current issues. If not then you should better buy this game and start playing as soon as possible.			"

												After sorting out some traditional driver-related issues and fiddling with the graphics settings, the game works. Which is more than I can say for quite a lot of other PC ports. It does run on rather low frames; I average 30-40 (although this is mostly down to me playing on a laptop, i7-4720 HQ, GTX 960M) FPS with graphics set to medium-low. Controller recommended for best gameplay (I use an XB1 controller). Soundtrack is top-notch and the graphics (even though I have to cripple it to play) are quite nice. Gameplay is also fun although the lack of ad-hoc saving can catch some people out.  "

												The first Nier was an ugly and slow masterpiece with a bland color palette and TONS of running back and forth through a mostly empty world. However, the story, characters, and frankly amazing soundtrack helped it punch in above its weight class.Automata is an excellent evolution of all of Nier's original parts. The bland colors are still there, but with hugely improved art style and character designs. The soundtrack continues to amaze and is much longer and more varied this time around. With Platinum Games at the helm, the combat system is also flashy and fun enough to sustain the longer, open-world format of this entry in the Nier (Drakengard?) series. And speaking of Drakengard, Automata borrows elements from the bonkers and frequely upsetting boss battles of Drakengard 3. I won't spoil anything, but...wow.The elephant in the room is PC performance. The game can look great, but it isn't on par with first-tier character action games like Tomb Raider. It doesn't seem to be very well optimzed either, particularly cutscenes, which are ""locked"" at 30 fps, but actually run MUCH worse, even on my pretty beefy system:i5 6700K @ 4.4 GHz16GB DDR4 2400 MHzOC'd GTX 1070Regular gameplay fares much better, at least for me. I've been enjoying 60 fps across the board at 1440p, with everything turned to high EXCEPT anti-aliasing, which is switched off. For some reason the AA seems to be the bottleneck for this game, with even 2x making the difference between a locked 60 and something more like 30-40.After the first Nier, I became invested in Yoko Taro's games, and I have not regretted it. They're weird, sometimes messy, and powerfully told. Automata is his best. I'll leave it at that.			"

												This game is a refreshing take on your usual hack and slash.The fighting mechanics are very much like Devil May Cry or Bayonetta.The story is intriguing and I keep going back for more.The music is astounding and I am very interested in buying the OST as it is.The boss battles are fun to play through, dynamic, and often have mutiple stages. Great!What makes it unique is that the game transforms from free roaming world to 2D platformer to Gradius ish top down fighter jet simulator. I love  how the game interchanges them.My only issue:The biggest issue I am vocal about is the lifeless world the game. The world lacks immersion in the sense that there is a lack of clutter and items to fill the scenes. Sure there are NPCS, theats, and a few animals however all the buildings you enter are completely empty of technology, items, and life. It's as if I am are running around cities that were being built by a construction crew just to rot. The developer could have really added more depth by adding more to the scenery of the game. Was the building a school, a work place, or a public service? Players could have explored through the structures and find easter eggs and lore but there is none of this. I feel like the geography and mapping is their beta landscape for the game without any investment.Overall this game brings a unique gameplay style I haven't seen and am thoroughly enjoying it!9/10			"

												Yoko Taro has served everyone on the dance floor. They don't know it. He doesn't know it. He might not have meant to do it, but he has.Nier:Automata is an incredible statement on art, culture, and philosophy in the early 21st century.Androids and machines, clinging to past ideals, philosophies, ways of action, saying and doing things because it's what people before them did, despite those actions having no meaning in the present, imitating what has gone before without a shred of the substance within that made those things tick.Much like most cultural produce in these times, and the words people cling to as philosophies.BUT NONE OF THAT MATTERS TO THE FACT THAT THIS IS A REALLY REALLY REALLY GOOD VIDEOGAME.Any philosophy, and even the great story, with its twists, reveals, and everything else is unintrusive icing on the cake that is this game. The core combat is good (and the I-frames are nice and forgiving). The switches between Platinum Character Action/Spectacle Fighter, Twin Stick Shooter Bullet Hell, Sidescroller, and Neo Retro Twin Stick Shooter Bullet Hell, are stylish and (mostly) smooth, and unlike so many games, each different component manages to be good on its own.There's a level of care and consideration put into every aspect of this game (except possibly the 1080p 60fps max res/framerate lock, and the model pop-in) that's just incredible.Uninstall your OS program? There's an ending for that.Use the Self-Destruct in the hyper-secret orbital space station base? They thought of that too.Equip a spear and a large sword? Oh, yeah, there's a special combo and set of gorgeous animations for that.And the animations are so good, too. This whole game is great. It's wonderful. Buy it, play it, love it.Even if you're just thinking about how much you want to **** 2B.			"

												This game has been a pleasant surprise. I expected a linear on rails hack and slash adventure, and instead got a fast paced open world RPG. Lets start with a basic list:Pros1. Great fast paced action2. Good story and plot3. A variety of play styles, bullet hell in a mecha jet, 2D platformer, 3D hack and slash and does them all well.4. RPG elements deep enough to engross but not convoluted enough to slow down flow5. Attractive characters, very refreshing considering the wests trend of making women ugly because of politics, male characters get the same treatment as the women including the ability to lose 9S's pants.6. Multiple endings and playthroughs that change the story and the main characterCons1: Very low res textures and low poly count for scenery2: Poor optimization, some speculate the games DRM Denuvo causes a lot of this3. The open world is a bit on the small side, it's not tiny like Lightning Returns but it gets smaller with each playthroughMusic is extremely subjective, all I can say is that it reminded me of Final Fantasy 13 a little.This has been the first game in a long time that I find very difficult to put down, there is always a lot to do and it's all fun. The game goes for a philosophical theme that a lot of people like to condescendingly put down to make themselves sound smart. The philosophy is implemented in such a way that it's more show and less tell, it's not shoved down your throat but it's there for you to think about or ignore at your own leisure. It adds depth without being pretentious or preachy and I'd say they got it perfect in that regard. Most importantly to me is that it never gets so deep into existential philosophy or so convoluted that it stops being grounded or making sense.The story itself is often serious and intense but it also doesn't take itself too seriously. It cracks jokes when it's appropriate and provokes emotion when it's appropriate. It doesn't break the 4th wall so much as it tries to blur the lines. Game elements like UI, death, and saving are implemented in a way to prioritize immersion over mechanics while still giving the functionality and player choice necessary. The RPG elements can use up a lot of time for people who enjoy loot grinding and min-maxing but are not so essential that someone couldn't play through without ever stopping to grind and still get the job done. Player progression can be divided into 3 parts, weapon upgrades, software enhancements, and exp levels. Aside from being able to equip software to boost exp gain, there isn't anything to the levels, no skill trees or points to distribute. The weapons feature an upgrade system with 4 levels per weapon and requires a combination of currency and materials to enhance. Simply doing occasional side quests and a little bit of looting during the story will be enough to max out a couple weapons well before you need them, but maxing all the weapons is an endeavor. Harkening back to the first Drakengard game, all weapons have a story that gets revealed with each weapon level. Lastly, the software in the form of chips is where players can tweak their builds to suite their playstyle and manage their HUD. Throughout the game the player will receive enough chips to keep their character functional, but optimizing a build, while unnecessary, will involve a lot of looting and is very rewarding. The game seems to be balanced around inefficient chips that are doled out during the story so people who go out of their way to min-max will likely find themselves overleveled and overpowered.There are difficulty settings to tweak the experience. I haven't played on easy but there are a plethora of optional chips a player can use to make the game play itself almost, so players who aren't very skilled can still enjoy the game. The higher difficulties receive a lot of mixed reviews for being way too hard or too easy, and I haven't seen any complaints about the normal setting. The one thing I can assure you is that you have options. While the game does not feature permadeath, it does have a death system similar to Dark Souls that can potentially be more punishing. If you don't recover your body before dieing a second time you lose your chips, which can be crippling. The game does not use auto save for immersion purposes so this can be gotten around in the rare case of a bug or for players who would rather wimp out and reload than lose a lot of time investment in chip building. I personally don't blame them as that would cause a lot of quitting if there wasn't a workaround, especially in the case of a crash or bug.The combat is what you can expect from a platinum game, fast paced, emphasizes timing and dodging, and mixes melee and ranged attacks. It's the meat of the game and the most fleshed out part, it's fast and fun and keeps the game going. It's probably the biggest reason I struggle to put the game down.Edit: Also, Jackass is best waifu ^_^			"

												Words cannot express my excitment for this game. I've played Nier and absolutely fell in love with the world, story, characters, and of course the amazing soundtrack. As I play through Nier: Automata I'm in awe of how beautiful this game is and I can't get enough of it. Perfect game! Thank You SquareEnix and Taro Yoko!!			"

												Out of all the gems this year, (too many imo, my wallet is dying) this is the first true contender for GOTY.  I loved Nioh, Zelda was overhyped to the point it was maddening but it was still a great game, but Nier, Nier is something truly special.  For having so many different kinds of gameplay fused into one game, Square-Enix and Platinum has proven to be a match made in heaven.  It all flows together so well, it just never gets dull or repetitive.   Which was my only gripe with the original Nier, the combat and gameplay could have used some more time in the oven.This feels like a slightly toned down Bayonetta/Devil May Cry in a well realized Square Enix open world.  A world that is giving me strange Metal Gear and Ghost in the Shell vibes, possibly due to the stellar soundtrack, sound effects and source material.  The characters have that bizarre Nier charm that was more common to many of the anime from the late 80's/early 90's.  The world isn't the prettiest, but it's far from ugly.  The enemy and boss designs are on a whole other level, some being extremely memorable and even breathtaking to behold.Honestly, I'm getting the same kind of vibes I got playing Secret of Mana back in the day on SNES.  It's just so damned addictive.  It cleverly breaks walls like the popular rpgmaker title One Shot but I won't spoil any of it.  Just get this game, avoid any and all spoilers and dive in.  It's beyond incredible!  10/10			"

												I honestly thought I'd dislike everything about this game outside of it's combat based on my experience with other waifu beat 'em ups and only bought this game because of Platinum's pedigree. I'm glad to say I was wrong.It's hard to describe what makes this game so special since it does play like you'd expect but there's a secret sauce, a specific combination of atmosphere, story, style and music that just makes something that feels like a real game and not a calculated product.That being said, there are some PC specific issues that should NEVER be present in a $60 PC release. Exclusive fullscreen basically doesn't work, borderless fullscreen doesn't work without the use of a 3rd party program and the draw/cascade distance for objects and shadows, even on high is about what you'd expect from an open world PS3 title.Still, I do not regret paying full price for this game. I believe NieR:Automata is a genuine classic, something we'll look back to for years to come and with a few patches/mods, a must have PC game.			"

												Pros:-2B's a.rse-2B's a.rse-2B's a.rse-2B's lips-2B's mole-2B's clevageokay for real now-Brilliant and well executed story with many interesting side-stories, great characters and lots of them! Lots of fun hacking and slashing, feels and feels, and that soundtrack, my god it flows so well with the specific areas you're in and whatever's the situation, hats off to the guys who made that OST!Cons:The port to PC isn't the best, out of the box in full-screen mode there are issues with resolution (I have a 1440p monitor and even when 1440p is selected in the settings it ends up looking like 900p or something). In-game AA absolutely murders FPS, I recommend disabling it and use the AA solution that AMD or NVIDIA Settings can offer. To get the best out of performance in this game you need FAR (Fix Automata Resolution), look it up on the Steam Community. That will fix resolution problems and potentially some other performance issues too, so after that with that combined I can pretty much max out the game on 1440p @ 60fps 95% of the time (i5 3570k, 16GB RAM, R9 390 OC'd). But still, shouldn't need to resort to third-party patches to fix performance/resolution issues in the first place.TL;DR Yoko Taro pulled off a damn masterpiece, just to keep in mind that this isn't a perfect PC port though.

												I vary rarely do reviews but I could not let myself not review this game.For one very simple reason. I LOVE the story, I like the gameplay. This is the only game I can think of that I will actually remember for the story. I honestly can't explain how much I love the story.Even with the problems currently plaguing the game, I can't reccomend this game enough. If you are someone who is interested in a complicated but good deep story, please at least consider it.That said; if you are someone who doesn't like the gameplay, don't buy the game. You won't have fun with it because it is a multi-ending game. You WILL play (kinda) through the same thing at least twice.I place this as my #1 game in the last 7 years and probably many more years to come.			"

												Superficially, NieR: Automata is a hack-n-slash between silver haired callipygian androids and cartoonishly toylike robots in a post-apocalyptic world. While that might be a good enough reason for some people, digging a little deeper into the game reveals some compelling writing and masterfully executed direction and storytelling. While it draws from standard Sci-Fi tropes, such as self-aware robots imitating human behavior, it does so in a way that complements to the main story. Ultimately, the game's story examines various themes of loss, specifically an existential loss of self-identity in polarizing situations. Existentialist, nihilist, and absurdist concepts are finely woven throughout the storyline, although admittedly they were pretty blatant by explicitly naming characters after famous philosophers. Even the tiny side-quest details, weapon histories, and archive information are rich with lore and philosophical questions (some of which may be a bit cryptic without prior knowledge of the story from the other games in the NieR universe). All of this culminates in an emotional and philosophical journey which I highly recommend, even if just for the story and perhaps more importantly, how the story is told.Of course, on top of that the gameplay is excellent, featuring fluid and acrobatic hack and slash 3rd person combat, bullet hell sequences versus giant robot fighter squadrons, mechanical mayhem, hacking minigames, and absurd jump puzzles. On normal difficulty, the game can quickly get too easy if you bother doing side quests and get overleveled. That being said, harder difficulties remain refreshingly exciting and punishing. I appreciated how some core gameplay elements are explained within the scope of the game universe, even down to the UI elements.Pros:+ Excellent overall story & storytelling+ Fun combat with solid mechanics and customization (weapon sets, pod abilities, chip sets)+ Amazing soundtrack that complements the various themes in the game very well+ Great models and animations for the androids, especially the main characters+ Specific setpiece environments are very well designed and received a ton of attention to detail. Defined camera angles helped to establish the mood in a few parts of the game. + Good voice acting (English)+ Did I mention how amazing the music is?+++ Epic boar ridingCons:- some story elements are a little convoluted and their significance can easily be lost to those unfamiliar with previous entries in the series.- a lot of the environments in the open world are bland and lacking detail, seeming more like a Potemkin village than a place meant for people to inhabit.- The second act of the game can be, for lack of a better word, a bit redundant at times. Well worth it in the third and final act, however. - Occasionally can't climb ladders properly. Probably the only gameplay bug that I encountered in the whole game though, so it's forgivable.- Unfortunately, although the game supports arbitrary screen resolutions it deals with fullscreen quite poorly by stretching from a lower resolution to fill the screen space - even on standard resolutions. As a result, the game looks pretty smeared out by default. Fortunately, This can be fixed using SKIM: http://steamcommunity.com/app/524220/discussions/0/135512104777399045/. Still a hassle, since the game runs perfectly fine otherwise.- while the game runs at 60fps on my six year old computer, cutscenes are jittery and limited to 30fps. This is probably a consequence of being a port from PS4, but strikes me as odd considering the pre-rendered nature of those scenes.			"

I also watched a video with Yoko Taro talking about ""Making weird games for weird people"" I am not disappointedI honestly can't talk about the game itself, because if I start talking about something it'll just lead to the next and never end. So all I'll say is, if you are into story heavy games get this  GEM	I absolutely loved every minute of NieR:Automata			"

Not a spectacle fighter but an immersive RPG!I was expecting a spiritual successor to Devil May Cry or Bayonetta. The combat in Nier Automata is simpler comared to those games but is still quite enjoyable. I think the combat balance is a bit off. The game seems too hard sometimes but after I found a particular healing upgarde it became almost too easy.However, combat is not the whole game. It is actually a complete RPG with main and side quests. The story and side quests are quite intersting so for. I also enjoy the character upgarde system quite a lot. Leveling up simply increases base stats. The main upgardes come in the form of plug-in chips. These chips grant special powers and perks. You can combing same types of chips to raise their level. An iteresting aspect of stats managements is the chip power cost. You have to select the best combination of chips for a particular situation. Oh, and if you die, the chips installed into your previous body are left behind (a-la bloodstains from Dark Souls).The game has some technical issues. In my case the resultion in fullscreen mode is clearly lower than the resolution I selected. So, I play in the windowed mode. Don't really care about that, because the game is too good :) But hopefully it will be patched soon.			"

The bad is mostly outdated graphics and some ""budget"" design choices.GOOD: - Top animations for in and out of combat movement.- Good timing in combat is satisfying and rewarding. Also super responsive.- Hotswap weapon sets and drone setups. Also multiple character upgrade setups so you don't have to rearrange every time. - Chip upgrade system is interesting, minmaxing the character is great.- Some exetremely creepy and thought provoking quests.- Nice blend of humour and despair.- Great enemy variety. Also the stuff they say in combat can range from lol to fml moments.- Amazing atmosphere with some breathtaking level design.- The gameplay variety from sidescrolling to top down shooter, it's good fun and is done very well. The controls are very intuitive in these segments.- Fun bosses, they get challenging and are literally insane :D - Soundtrack is top of it's kiind and always builds the right atmosphere. - At 3440 x 1440 res on full settings I get stable 60fps, not many recent games can claim they'll achieve that.I have more but I'll throw this in: You can mount the animals and ram enemies with them!THE BAD:- Cutscenes are horrid, if your res is bigger than 1080p, enjoy the pixel art!- Voice acting can get a bit cringy at times, in both English and Japanese, there is some bad timing/pacing, everythign is just delivered like a punchline.- Game looks like it's at least 4 years old already, no visual feast here. Sure the design is good but that's preety much it.- Can't change sound settings in main menu so full blast music every time you launch.- 80% of the crap you collect is junk but you have to keep it just in case. :|- Weird difficulty jumps, e.g. you get a side quest with level 34 enemies before you even unlock an area where enemies hang around level 25.- There are too many invisible walls, too many places look liek you could go there but apparently you can't.- You'll end up accidently talkign to your sidekick when trying to open chests/pickup items.

(White screen bug disapeared) Now, I may be using some of the smallest windowed options available (I forgot the resolution, but who cares), I may be playing at 22-25 FPS at max (Even in high open areas), but damn, I'm having fun and am very content with my purchase!Cutscense will kick up to 30 and 60 FPS at this tiny screen, so that's good, and playing the game at a lower FPS makes the whole dodging thing much more resonable. Also, I'm using an XBOX controller, so I HIGHLY RECOMMEND USING A GOMEPAD OF SOME SORT!Oh and for those of you who have God Eater on Steam and who have played it with a controller, you will find the controls to be very similar. VERY SIMILAR. However, I'd personally swap the Gun Fire and Dodge buttons with one another (Finger cramp). Same goes for the Auto Lock (I don't use it because I've played too much God Eater) and the Alt Fire buttons. It makes the game have a movement style of a Hack and Slash [s]God Eater[/s], but a gun play of an FPS. Speaking of God Eater, the cutscenes can occasionally have audio and visual syncing issues, but that's because of my potato (I'm giving it all she's got Captain). If you liked God Eater, with all it's weird quirks, then this game will be very pleasing to you. A lot of thing's you'd expect like button combos from God Eater carry over here. Oh but the price doesn't carry over... Unless you add up the NG+ gametime (3+ playthroughs I believe), then you might hit around that area.Point is, do your research before buying any game and don't be like me. Ok, maybe be like me and be content with what you can get. Even failures. POTATO LAPTOP FTW!			"

												Man I shouldn't be posting a review when I haven't even finished the first actual ending yet, but I feel like this is neccesary.This game launched today. I got out of bed at roughtly 10 am. I started playing around 11.Since then I have logged almost 11 and a half hours on this game.I haven't fallen in love with a game this much since I had played MGS V for the first time. The gameplay is very smooth and polished, just like the platinum games we all know and love. Within the first couple bosses, you get the same amount of Yoko Taro oddness that you've come to know and love from his previous games. Along with that, since it is by Yoko Taro, the plot is absolutely riveting, with rapid fire twists and turns before you finish your first game.If you have $60 in your entertainment budget lying around, I highly recommend this gem of an RPG. You will not regret it.			"

												(Will give PC specs at the end) After playing for about 2 hours all I can say is that I totally recommend this game. Awesome graphics, nice plot. As far as optimization is concerned I don't have any issues on my end, stable 60 fps (1920x1080), there also seems to be a 60 fps cap, as some other players mentioned it before me. And someone noticed  it before, and it seems to be true, cutscenes seem to be capped at 30 FPS sometimes. Other than that I haven't noticed anything so far. The combat system is really nice, couldn't ask for anything better, there seems to be plenty of combos. Boss fights are epic. I'm not used to play that kind of game with the keyboard, so it was a bit hard the first minutes. Easy camera control since you don't need to use the mouse to play (I didn't need it so far), tho you can control the camera with the mouse but I'd rather use the arrows. I guess that's it. Anyways, right now, this game is a 10/10.PC Specs:Windows 10 64 bitsi5-6500 (3.2 GHz)GTX 1060 OC 6Gb8GB RAM			"

												Overhyped games are often disappointing so I wasn’t sure of what to except from this one but, overhaul he is pretty nice. In fact the biggest flaw of the game is to be too short and easy. So should you buy this game? Here some point to help you decide; •	Despise being open world the game is mostly story-driven so don’t except the same feel as playing an elder scrolls for example.•	The game is fragmented in three play through/cycles the second being a replay of the first from another point of view, and then the third giving you the end of the story.•	Gameplay-wise the game is pleasant but again too short, more side quest would have been great. The difficulty is not very high either so if you seek challenge don’t hesitate to pick the hardest from the start (no auto lock and being one shot by any source of damage)•	The story has an old anime vibes, mixing silly elements with deeper thematics. Also most of the characters you encounter during the game have interesting backstory but be prepared for a lot of tragic outcomes. •	At first glance the game seems dull and washed but it goes well with the atmosphere of the story. •	The soundtrack is divided in pretty atmospheric themes and more punchy one for some battles (Birth of a wish is pretty cool). Overhaul pleasant, the music really had something the ambiance of the game. "

												After almost 70 hours of gameplay and successfully gotten 100% of everything, I can finally say that this game has become one of my favorite games that I've played in my whole life. No game has ever given me this sort of drive to want to grab everything I can and made me want to read everything that the game has to offer me. I have not skipped a single cutscene during my first playthrough through all of the endings because the story and the characters intrigued me and made me want to actually know what is happening. The gameplay compliments the story and vice versa. If you are going to get this game, though, I completely recommend you at least play the original NieR. There are some heavy references to it that, knowing the context, will hit you harder and make the events that play out be more effective. But it is still entirely optional.			"

												The sequel that never should've happened, that despite all odds, came to fruition and shined like the brightest star in the sky, Nier: Automata, is a game I am actually proud to have played. Finally, Yoko Taro has made a game that does what he wants it to while also being a joy to play, with Platinum helping out tremendously in that department.While it is a sequel, prior knowledge of the first Nier isn't really required, since it came out in 2010 and was a cult hit at best. It certainly doesn't hurt to be familiar with the setting, however, and I'd recommend checking it out in some fashion anyway because it is a good story by itself and many of the designs carry over here. Plus, the Drakengard/Nier series is gloriously strange and a wonder to experience by itself.With that out of the way, the gameplay of Automata is standard Platinum character action, with a couple twists. The combat is essentially Bayonetta-lite, you can equip weapons in the light or heavy slot, each weapon has a combo string for light attacks and heavy attacks depending on their upgrade level. And then you have your Pod, a little support drone sort of thing that acts as a ranged weapon and can have special attacks equipped to it. Multiple Pod types exist, you can find them in the game world for different ranged attacks and more special attack slots. Aside from that, that's pretty much what you've got in terms of combat. Thankfully, the new plug-in chip system helps you customize your own personal fighting style.Plug-in chips are frequent drops and buyable from most stores, they're sort of a passive buff system. Starting the game off, you have a limited chip capacity, but you can expand it to max fairly easily, and you do really want to prioritize that. Chip effects run the gamut from giving you a flat percentage increase to weapon damage, ranged damage, giving you higher defense, using items automatically at critical health, activating the counter function, and even giving you this game's version of Witch Time. You can fuse chips to boost their effect while also increasing the capacity they take up. Simple to understand, you can grind freely to get the numbers and effects you desire for a kitted out build.As an addendum to plug-in chips, they did add a sort of Dark Souls-esque recovery system. If you die, the chip set you were using is left where you died, and you have to go back to get it if you don't want to grind for your goods. Other players' death sites can be found as well, and you can ""retrieve"" their body to restore your health as well as temporarily gain a few of their chip effects, or you can repair them to act as a temporary fighting companion. Somewhat of an odd system, but not obstructive, I'd say.As in the first Nier, the camera and movement will change occasionally depending on where you are. You go from full 3D to top down, to sidescroller, and back again, seamlessly. Coming with that system is the mild bullet hell as well. Enemies can fire slow moving projectiles, some can be shot by Pod fire, others have to be dodged or struck with melee. Easy enough to grasp and understand, really.The music and sound design for Automata are absolutely astounding, in a word. It's hard to think of a single song I didn't like, and the timing for when they kick in, when they dynamically change, it's all just so amazingly well done. I honestly wish I could say more, but that's all I have here. I'm probably gonna buy the OST when I can. It's just really, really good.Admittedly, the PC port isn't fantastic. I've had it a lot better than from what I hear elsewhere. The only issue I had a repeating instance of was that the Steam overlay was weirdly fuzzy. My rig is pretty decent, though, so check around if you're unsure, and don't be afraid to refund if it just isn't working out. So, the story. It's really good. You can get a basic starting summary off the store page, I'm cautious about saying much more than that because there are many things people would consider spoilers. Suffice to say, you play as an oddly dressed battle android. She fights robots. What I don't feel is spoilery is the multiple ending aspect. Once you reach the first ending, don't worry, that's not how the story ends. Just keep playing. That's how DrakeNier rolls, things will expand as you keep playing. Having beaten the game, I will say that if you're pretty familiar with character action games, don't be afraid to bump the difficulty to hard. On normal things were pretty easy for me. And save frequently. There are no autosaves. Most of all...Don't give up. We're all cheering for you.			"

What's the difference between a human and a machine when the machine is self aware, has feelings and beliefs just like the human? Are we still ourselves when our memories get transferred from our dead body into a new living body? Are we still ourselves if our dead body gets revived, but we loose all of our memories?Is the nature of mankind conflict? Or rather is conflict an inevitability that stems from inteligence?____________________________________________________________________________________This game got me thinking about what makes us human. I don't think there is anything particular that can define you as human other than the fact you are born as one. No traits, nothing distinctive, but when it comes to self identity, what is it that makes us, us? Is it our bodies or memories or maybe both? Imagine in a world where you could transfer your consciousness into a computer, your body would no longer define you because you would be inside of a computer. Your memories would have to define you, but then imagine if you're in a computer as a means to live forever and someone created an artificial intelligence that's sentient, self aware and its a perfect copy of you, exact same memories, exact same personality traits, exact same voice, what will make you ""you"" then? It can't be your body because you're a computer, and it can't be your memories neither now that you have a perfect, identical copy of yourself as an AI. What makes you ""you"" then? This is exactly what makes this game incredible. The concepts it covers, the questions it asks. It makes you think, It doesn't give you an answer, just fuel for thinking.As I'm writing this, I have just completed route A and still have route B and C to complete. Having only completed 1/3 of the main story in a sense, I know for a fact this game will stay with me for a long time. Absolutely fantastic experience. Great combat, impressive music, nice looking world and a good amount of content to keep you busy. Can't recommend it enough.			"

												Man i have fallen in love with this game. I made it through a single playthrough at leisure on normal mode. I used a ps4 controller and a program called input mapper (Hint: If you dont have an xbox controller but you do have a ps4 controller give input mapper a shot) to play. It took a bit of getting used to but i can now keep my pod firing and be able to dodge and still do a vareity of attacks. Im now on my second playthrough, and it looks as if it only gets better from there. It seems youll need to play through the game a few times to fully understand. I had one issue and that is the game crashed for seemingly no reason after i got through the first part of the game. I had already saved and therefore only lost a few minutes of progress. Im running an i5 GTX 1060 with 6 gbs of vramand 16 gbs of ddr4 ramRunning at 60 fps even in intense combat.PS: Hacking made easy if youve played anything like binding of isaac			"

												Pro-Story is insanely interesting. I spent more time reading the lore in the intel than in any other game-Combat is fun and animations are so #@%^ing cool-Characters are unique and lovable and memorable-Multiple playthough tells a story that cannot be told any other way-Visual novel and story book interesting way to convey your enemies' side of the story-3D to 2D transitions is super unique and gives an aspect of platforming-Bullet hell is quite fun and interesting...especially the last one *wink* Con-Difficulty curve between normal mode and hard mode is quite large in the beginning but evens out later on-Require you to know the story of Nier and one of the ending in Drakengard 1 and one of the ending in Drakengard 3-Better with controller than M+K------------------------------------------------------------This game is phenomenal. The linkage between Drakengard and Nier to this game is incredibly interesting and thought provoking. If you have played Drakengard and/or Nier, this is a must play for you. It develops on themes and ideas introduced in those games and comes to a conclusion at the end(?). The gameplay is very fun and I'm very happy that Platinum discovered a middle-ground between mindless hack-and-slash and Bayonetta's high skill ceiling perfect frame combos. Boss fights are hard but not impossible. They have patterns and weakness and learning these is what makes the game so fun and rewarding. Nier:Automata has many facets of fighting and action. As you progress through the game, you will see that there are multiple ways to fight enemies; not just with your sword. The gameplay is so interactive: so many things to do, so many things to see, so many things to read and explore. The story is very interesting and can only be done in a video game format. The multiple playthroughs focuses on different sides of the story and it helps you connect deeply to the characters. The foreshadowing in the quests, the dialogs between characters, and each character's subtle actions are all connected and revealed at the end. While playing the game to completion, I kept thinking ""I need someone to dicuss what happened here!"" because the story is so immersive and mysterious and fulfilling that I had to vocalize my satisfaction and thoughts. Even though I ""earned"" all the achievements, I will definitely go back to finish all the quest and beat ""all"" the bosses again. THIS GAME HAS LEFT ME MENTALLY, EMOTIONALLY, AND PHYSICALLY DRAINED. There were so much feelings and thought running through my head at the end that I just sat there and recounted all the events that occured.Although there are some VOCAL MINORITY with playability issues, I can say that my Nvidia 970 held up to 60fps on high settings (excluding AA). The game is better with a controller than mouse and keyboard.			"

												This game got gifted to me by a friend.Pros:One of the best OST out thereIt can be stable at 60 FPS. HIGHLY recommended to disable AA and V-Sync.The combat mechanics are absolutely brilliantBoss fights are all different with vast combat stylesSide Quests are fun. I like to do all side quests available and they are not boring at all.Story is greatVisuals are greatEnglish VA isn't tacky Cons:Sadly the port is not good but there is now an unofficial fix for most issues people are having.I completed the game, got all 26 endings, erased my data and now I'm on my second playthrough. This game never gets old, the soundtrack is mesmerising, the story has left me feeling desolate and I've never enjoyed doing boss fights this much. As most people said playing with a controller would be more comfortable but it's unnecessary, all down to preferences anyway. Highly recommended game.			"

												This game is nothing short of amazing. I'm currently playing in a small 720p window, minimum settings (minus effects at high) with probably around 20-40 FPS, however, this game alone has pushed me to order a new gpu AND cpu just so I can experience it in Ultra settings (or at least high 1080). The graphics, even at such low quality as it is for me now, are still absolutely beautiful and the fighting in this game has me having more fun than I've experienced in any other similar game. The story is great so far as well and the music is really well done too. As much as I wanna wait for my new gpu to play more, it's hard to stop playing.			"

												yeah, probably my new favorite game. Great gameplay. Great music. Story is TBD (I've only played about an hour). The gameplay reminds me of old times. It reminds me of a really good PS2 game. The intentions of the developer remind me of the same. apparently Yoko has stated that he has no plans for DLC which in my opinion is awsome. It is released as a finished game, the way it should be.There are a few issues. while the game does give you a slew of graphical options it does not provide the option to run in borderless windowed. There does seem to be a 60 fps lock. The cutscenes stutter quite a bit. These are not issues that can't be fixed with a simple patch. Overall, I reccomend. We need more games like this on PC.			"

 Visionary. I always disliked that word. It always seemed to refer to cult, artsy movies that no one understands.Yet there really isn't a better word to describe this work of art.Recently, most games and movies I've experienced feel like fast-food: they may be good fast-food but none were truly memorable. This game is not one of them.Is it a perfect game gameplay wise? No.Does it have high end graphics? No.Is all dialogue voiced? No.But it's the most thought provoking game I've ever played. This game takes ludonarrative dissonance by the hand and say ""it's alright."" It's weird, it has a kickass soundtrack, it has the best credits ever, it's sad, contemplative. It will make you feel and make you question a lot of different things.If you finish this game (and I mean really finish it), it will likely forever change your perception of videogames as a medium for art and self-expression.In short, it is truly visionary.The question that remains is ""is it for me?""If you never heard of Yoko Taro before (I hadn't prior to this title), I strongly recommend two videos:Philosophies of Violence -

												NieR: Automata is one of those experiences i won't forget.It's enchanting OST, incredibly beautiful visuals, intriguing storyline and most importantly fantastic gameplay leads to a game that you just keep coming back to.My expectations for this game were high and it still managed to greatly surprise with its quality and also makes me want to try the previous games from the series, as it is my first one.What really brought me to this game was it's similarity with Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance since it was developed by the same company and i definitely wasn't left dissapointed, it was absolutely worth paying the full price, many other developers should watch and learn how to make a great fully priced titles.My only complaints would be about the game's optimalization in some places, and the developer's response to them, NieR: Automata has been out for a week and currently there is still no patch that would adress the most prominent issues with their product (although it was announced that they are aware of the game's problems and are working on fixing them).Also i feel like the game could have a bit better side quests and activities, since they can get repetetive after while, but i still might be a bit spoiled from The Witcher 3 so excuse me if i'm being picky.I would also like to give huge Thank You to some of the community members that worked on their own patches in order to fix the fullscreen bug and improve the game's performance, you guys are Gods among men.I hope that Yoko Taro-Senpai will team up with Platinum Games once more in the future to make another great product as it is match made in heaven.My final score for the game is a strong 9/10.

												Went in for the 2B bootyStayed for the beautiful music, great story, and well developed combat.My only problem with this game is the (current) Fullscreen issues and the locked 60 FPS(This also causes the cutscenes to drop to 30 FPS or sometimes even less)Currently playing windowed gives the best performance.If you can get past that one issue, you can easily enjoy this game.*Edited 3/26/17*With the rise of community support on this game. Patchers and fixes are showing up like crazy! I can no run this game very smoothy and do it at above 1080P! Now, if you'd rather wait until an official fix comes out you can. But if you're really eager to get into this wonderful game it is very easy to install the mods and get it running optimaly! I just beat endings A and B and my god is this game fantastic and rich in story! You feel for these characters from minute one and you will keep feeling for them long after you put the game down! Not a flawless launch but this is still a game you should own in your steam library! I give it a solid 9.25/10			"

												Near Autoerotica is the lastest hentai Halo 2 energy sword singleplayer adventure game. You play as Tubie, some anime girl that doesn't know what pants are.

												Wow! Do i recommend? Hell i do! But let's do some (short) research ""why"" first.So:Game isn't that bad optimized as they say and maybe graphic isn't top tier, but scenery is so beatiful that it compromise lack of technology.Story, och the story! Can't say much without spoilers, but it's one of bests in the games.... Well, I'm kinda exaggerating, but the way it's told makes it too good to let you leave your seat. It's my personal 10/10.In gameplay way only thing i didn't like were subquests. They're kinda nice, but mostly require travel a lot and even if you're going to use fast travel - they'll bore the **** out of you. Rest - fighting, main quests, npc's dialogues, upgrading weapons, dying of eating fish - it all makes the perfect game.How do I rate Nier? I'd say its 9 or 10 out of 10, but anyway - just what the hell are you still doing here? Go buy your god damn copy already!PS: Yeah, you can die (and get ending) by eating fish.			"

												Nier Automata is an amazing experience. While the pc port may not be the best and there were questionable decisions in certain parts gameplay wise I cannot recommend this game enough. It's the type of game that you will want to talk about right away after completing. The story and music are perfect, the combat is great, the characters are interesting and the feels are top notch. One thing to note is the story doesnt tell you everything, it is highly recommended that you explore and do every side quest as it ties everything together nicely.			"

												Thoughts so far- NieR:Automata in the first hour and a half of play has certainly lived up to the hype.Gameplay is fun and versatile, with all kinds of genres of games seamlessly put together to make probably one of the most interesting games to play I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing.I honestly don't  know how Yoko Taro managed to implelent all these styles of gaming without ever making it feeling gimmicky.Combat is fun and fluid, though as with any game you will need a bit of practice to start getting some combos going.I haven't played enough yet to comment on the story (though I have played Drakengard (Dragon Dragoon) and NieR (yes, ending E) so I have some clue, sort of).From what I've seen there have been complaints about this being a bad port and running poorly on PC.I can only speak for myself, but with my GTX 970 this game runs flawlessly at 60fps, I've had to issues with resolution, no crashes, no frame drop, nothing.This of course does not mean you should ignore the people complaining of those issues, 'cause obviously they are issues that really, really need to be addressed, I'm just saying that for me, in my experience this has been a good port.That said, this is a Ps4 game so I would honestly recommend using a controller of some sort, I myself am using the Steam Controller, which is partially supported by Nier. For the sake of this review though I did try out the PC controls, they weren't horrible or extremely clunky by any means, but you could tell that this game was made for a gamepad.End verdict-I definitely would recommend NieR: Automata, if only for the unique experience it provides (though that's definitely not all it's got going for it). If you are worried about the game having issues as some have experienced though, then maybe you should hold off until a patch has been released before you blow £40 on it.I'll rewrite this as a proper review and not just a flurry of first impressions once I've experienced more of the game, so don't hate for the poor formatting.- Maybe I should mention, I don't give a ♥♥♥♥ if cutscenes are capped to 30fps, I'm to play the game so it's the acutal gameplay that matters to me, stop crying over something so pathetic.

												+ Fluid, responsive gameplay that Platinum has gotten us used to+ Intersting story, though if you haven't seen anything about the original Nier, you're going to miss a lot. Despite not actually needing it to understand what's going on, it adds to the world building.+ Open world that does not feel overwhelming. You never feel completely lost, which is a problem in this type of games.+ Wonderful soundtrack? Multiple playthroughs are necessary to experience everything the game has to offer. Not sure it's a positive or negative, but at this point, it's a tradition in the Drakengard/Nier series- You might start some quests and realize 5 mins later that they are meant for when you have 20-30 more levels, which leads to frustrating deaths.- Fullscreen does not run at 1080p, but windowed 1080 does? Waiting for a patch on this.- Some ocasional quirks with hitboxes when platforming- Not as deep of a combat system as BayonettaNote: Haven't noticed any performance problems other than 30 fps on cutscenes, which is annoying but not really a big problem.

												I played NieR: Automata first on PS4 and liked the game so much that I wanted to also play it on PC with PC quality graphics and sound, and so far the game on PC has not disappointed me. I’m having none of the issues regarding white screen, flickering etc that others are reporting. I’m playing on Win7 x64 using an NVIDIA GTX1060 with driver set 376.53, 16GB RAM, an i7-3770 with an Xbox 360 wireless game pad in full screen mode at 1920x1080 resolution and the game for me is stable with no frame rate, graphics, or other performance issues.  In fact for me it performs better than the console version since the frame rate never decreases during combat.This game is a third person action JRPG, the art style is unique and well done, the sound track is awesome and really helps set the mood in a variety of situations, and the combat is engaging and fun similar to the melee combat in God Eater. There are approximately 26 individual endings to NieR: Automata, three of which you get by playing\replaying the campaign. During each subsequent play throughs you play as another android and learn what happened when you were playing as the other characters so the story changes each time and isn’t simply a new game plus. This game is set in the Drakengard 3 and Nier universe, but knowledge of the previous games are not required because NieR: Automata isn’t a direct sequel but rather a standalone game set in the same universe thousands of years after the events of the previous games. Players with knowledge of Drakengard and Nier will find references to the previous games but nothing that takes away from the game for those who didn’t play the earlier entries.The only short fall for me in the game is the random forced changes of perspective\view where you're playing in the traditional third person action RPG POV and then you're side scrolling or top down. The longer I played the less annoying the switches were. The store page states there are steam achievement however I see none and none of the game achievements have unlocked after three hours of PC play.***Edit*** Achievements are now showing for the game			"

												This game is great. there are ways around every single thing people are complaining about, from the fullscreen thing to the crashing, to the low frame-rates. Step 1) Download borderless gaming from githudStep 2) after you download Nier go into the .exe and select your graphics card you want to use to run the game (for some reason the game doesnt auto default to your nvidia/AMP)Step 3) Profit?Step 4) Enjoy.In all fairness, while we shouldnt have to go through all the hoops and stuff in order to get the game to work, there are ways, and if your not one of the ones who just fired up this game and it worked perfectly fine (it didnt for me) then these easy, simple things will fix the issues.Once you get this game running, holy hell. Its a blast. The intro alone is worth $60 IMO,never have i played a game that isn't scared to go from 2d bullet hell into hack n slash then into a top down shooter, i mean serious its intense. The game can be unforgiving, but for those of you who find it so, i have another tip for you. EVADE! no seriously.But at the end of the day, this game is all about the combat, and let me tell you, the combat in this game is so amazing, so fluid, easily the best style of combat i have played this year.

At once a fully modern open-world action rpg , a bullet hell shooter, a side scrolling beat 'em up, and a top down action adventure, this game is also a deep philosophical meditation on the essence of what it is to be human.

NieR:Automata.At first I hated this PC port: - subpar menu navigation with mouse- impossible to shoot properly in 360° shooter segments with mouse- similar to above; cannot aim pod properly in sidescroller segments with the mouse (and therefore cannot aim laser)- optimisation- double tap to dodge, occasionally unresponsive dodges- 720p@30fps cutscenes retained from PS4 version- occasional video issues in fullscreen mode- some quests cannot be completed until you reload the areaI considered either dropping the game until fixes came through or just buying a PS4 controller and halving the above issues by half but the combat was so addictive that it just made me continue playing it (and also the PS4 controller costs more than the game). Granted, I had some rage and salt moments in the first few hours from the KB/mouse controls.Few more hours into the game, many of the qualms I had with controls faded as I found ways to work around them. As far as my own experience goes (your mileage may vary):+ dodge more reliable if you let go of all movement keys before double tapping+ dodge more reliable if you alternate dodge directions, otherwise has chance of not registering double tap as dodge+ shmup sections more playable if you abuse LMB/RMB; don't expect to shoot any targets with the mouse+ hacking minigame more manageable if you use arrow keys to aim+ don't use the laser if you play with mouse during sidescroller segments unless you are on the same plane as your enemy+ WASD navigates menu easier+ use 3rd party program to force borderless windowed mode with your preferred resolution if you have full screen issues+ pray if you run into suicide machines during sidescroller segments. That mouse won't save you now.Still hoping for some fixes but a lot of us sticking through with the current port will probably end up 100%-ing the game before the first fix comes out. Seriously though, please at least give us a dedicated dodge button and actual mouse aiming.It's a shame that such a good game had to be marred with a crappy PC port.			"

												First off I should say that as of (3/20/2017) the PC port is having problems for some people. Issues can be somewhat minor, from frame dips and slight stutter, to major stuff like crashing and wiped saves. It’s all over the place for many people, so I recommend reading up on that and trying your hand at this game yourself. Remember that Steam refunds exist if you're one of the more unlucky ones. I have no doubt that if the port didn’t have issues, this game would be in the overwhelmingly positive area. I’d say wait for a patch but...its Square Enix.Now as far as the game is concerned...Profound is not a word I use much to describe most games these days, nor the word beautiful in a non-graphical sense. I would absolutely use both those words to describe this game.The first Nier game was...a mixed bag to say the least. What it may have lacked in gameplay and graphics, it more than made up for in its story, characters, and amazing music, which drew a sizeable audience and obtained cult like appeal. Nier Automata retains the good stuff you liked about Nier, but asks the question ""what if it was made by Platinum Games?""While you may think that this will be over the top combo crazy like Bayonetta or Metal Gear Rising, Nier Automata goes more for Platinum’s trademark style, but simplifies the combat to be more accessible to a wider audience, which can be seen as a con to some people. The amount of combos available is limited, and all matching weapon types have the same move set (i.e. all small swords have the same moves as all other small swords), though Nier Automata’s combat is still far more enjoyable than Nier’s lackluster system. However the game makes up for its shortcomings by drawing strength from its variety of play styles.Not only will it switch between camera angles often, but the play styles can range from twin stick shooter, brawler, side scroller, hacking mini games, bullet hell, to arcade space shooting. Sounds like a mess right? By all rights it really SHOULD be but...its not. Nier Automata is one of those very rare breeds that can combine multiple game types into one play through and somehow make it WORK, and that’s a mystery unto itself.The difficulty is kind of…all over the place too. As a game experience, you’re in for a treat, but if you’re looking for a challenge you’ll probably want to up the difficulty. One thing I don’t agree with though is that on hard or very hard mode, the game removes your ability to lock on. I don’t really think it’s a good idea when games lock off central game mechanics to add “challenge”, like in the Batman Arkham series when harder modes locked off your counter sense. That’s just my thoughts on it anyway.Another problem Nier had was its graphical quality. As much as I loved the game it looked...bad. So how does Nier Automata hold up? Well its...okay. Just okay. You'll frequently find textures that are low resolution (almost PS2 like sometimes), and others that are passible, just passible. Pop-in is also an issue in wide open areas, a noticeable one, which can break the flow sometimes. However when the game is in motion, especially in combat, these issues become much less noticeable, and for the most part the animations are quite good, and when you’re faced with such beautiful environments and scenery, graphical fidelity becomes more of an afterthought.The big draw to this game though is of course the same things that drew people to the original game. Its characters are interesting and have personality, and even the enemies are a joy to listen to and fight. The environments strike that perfect middle ground of being desolate and beautiful at the same time and inspire awe when you see them for the first time (especially the theme park). The world evokes the feeling of depression yet hope at the same time, giving an almost Dark Souls like feeling of oppression. All of the above is also GREATLY improved by the soundtrack.If you are a fan of Niers soundtrack, I can almost bet my life you'll love this one too. Music sung in an ancient (made up) language and tracks and dynamically change to various situations, dropping out and putting in vocals and background instruments on the fly. Id argue this soundtrack is even better than the first game, and I’m buying it the second it’s available.The story is well told and, in Nier fashion, will have multiple endings to unlock to further understand the story. Although these endings will require multiple playthroughs, you will play as different characters in different situations to help alleviate that, as well as getting new cutscenes and dialog. Understandably though, some people might be a bit annoyed by the repetitive nature of this.In conclusion, I can safely say that Nier Automata is a more than worthy successor to Nier, and I can absolutely recommend this game to those interested. Though it trades in some flaws of Nier for new ones, I can say that this game is a true piece of art, and something that can only be truly expressed in this type of art medium.			"

												Nier is what would happended if Metal Gear Solid and a Final Fantasy had a child.The OST is a eargasm in itself, but too truly appreciate how powerful the OST is in regards too the story/theme and gameplay you have to play Nier. Dont spoil it untill you listen to the music during gameplay its a masterpiece!This game is a 10/10 for me, any possible shortcomings are just negligable compared too everything else Nier does right and has to offer.Game of the Year for me by a long shot and definitely in my top 5 list .Thank you Yoko Taro  and Platinum Games for this materpiece and pushing the envelope in game design and story telling.

												So I personally don't write reviews for games, think I have one more other than this. However Nier breaks that trend, currently I have 2 hours game time, and I have to say it has the potential to be very good. There's many things in the game, from fishing to riding moose, and im sure there will be even more the more I play through it. I'm personally doing a let's play of it on my personal YouTube channel and as a result I'm only playing on Normal, but it still gives an enjoyable challenge.

												Haven't finished it, and probably won't for a while (well I start to get the feeling that there's not going to be a good ending... And I don't want to feel sad about the story for a while lol). But from what I have played so far, this game is really good, especially how well the music fits with the atmosphere (though that only made me feel more pessimistic about the ending of the game). I actually found the characters interesting, but that might be just due to my exposure to these kind of character traits. Well since basically I liked pretty much everything of this game, I'll just say a few things that I wished would be there.First... Sometimes te camera would automatically move downward when sprinting and just generally move to certain fixed angles during some movements. Though I definitely liked the fan service that it brought about, I just didn't like a camera view so low down sometimes... Also being able to zoom out would be nice too, as fighting and managing camera angle frequently has never been my strong point. Second... It's probably just me, but when the game switches to a 2D scroll game while the map is still kind of 3D (so that I need to go around corners and stuff), I found the control to be a bit annoying. Maybe make it so that if, for instance, I want to keep running to the right around a corner, I can just keep going right instead of right-down/up-right.Lastly... Maybe have a even lower graphics setting so that I can run it on an older laptop? I see how the game is supposed to look really nice and lowering the settings would kind of remove that good side of it, but I would like to at least see the story at some point before I get my desktop up and running next year (well various situations determined this). I also know that there's a mod for lowering the global illumination points, but I would love to see it as an in game setting.All in all, a great game, since whoever sees this (probably no one) would probably have noticed that I was basically just nitpicking. Get it if you have confidence if your hardware, I think you won't regret it. Don't hold me accountable though :P			"

												9/10Scroll down for the bad.I am currently through my first playthrough which took about 16 hours without any of the sidequests completed. Working on the second playthrough (which is arguably like the second half of your first complete play).The combat never gets old. The boss fights are fun and rewarding. I have yet to encounter anything that is unfair.The story is engrossing BUT you have to get through the first boss fight and to your first save point (be patient, it can take a couple tries).The side quests are varied, the crafting is perfect and the resource availability and money earning is spot on. There is a hidden amount of depth in the way you build your character in this. At first it seems simple and shallow but you will learn later that the small tweaks make a big difference (and they are expensive).Hands down the combat in this game is some of the best I've ever experienced. I normally loath the hack and slash genre  and am not typically great at bullet hell style games. The combination of the two had me weary but I am thrilled at the way they work together in Nier. Being rewarded for perfect dodges is an absolute thrill.The Bad:The game does not do enough to ensure that you know all the different ways you can upgrade yourself.You are HEAVILY punished if you die before the first save point. Even skipping encounters on hard it can easily take 30 minutes to get to the boss fight. If you fail you have to do the ENTIRE opening sequence again.The buildings feature what looks like wide open doors and window spaces but there are invisible barriers. Initially this is very jarring until you get used to some of the subtle visual clues that let you know which ones you can enter and which you cant.Neither good nor bad:The map. First they don't tell you that there are actually a many areas and markers you cant reach intially (they will be unlocked in later playthroughs or later in the game). Having those red dots all over the map really drove me up a wall.The map is not detailed at all and it can be easy to miss the fact that it's actually in 3D. Many of the waypoints are well UNDER the surface of the map, which you wont be able to see initially.I HIGHLY reccomend this game (which I don't do often), even if you are not normally a fan of this genre. The story, the variety of the areas you fight in, the strangeness of the quests all blend together wonderfully. The side quests are anything but boring and all add to the depth of the world and the struggles it faces. "

												It's fine, gameplay gets monotonous sometimes and it's definitely not as hard as you'd expect a flagship Platinum game to be. Might want to turn up the difficulty a bit if you're used to devil may crys and bayonettas or whatever. Then again, some sections have camera angles that are too far away from 2B (your playable character), and 9S (your AI-controlled sidekick) also likes to wear gothic-lolita-black so I sometimes lose track of 2B and die like an idiot. Everything else is top tier, particularly the music damn that music so poignant.Also fix the damn port already, the choppy cutscenes are inexcusable and I consider myself lucky since that's my only issue. Well, other than framerate dips but I like to think that's my FX-8350 and not poor optimization. Although it never dips under 30 fps so that's... good.			"

												Just finished my first play through of the game (Ending A).This game is extremely diverse, whilst mostly stick with 3rd person hack & slash also delved into top down and side scrolling modes.I've enjoyed every moment of this game so far and am going to try work my way through all 25 endings.Great hack & slay action, beautiful soundtrack, immersive and interesting storyline. 8/10			"

												This is a great game so far. Even though i have the resolution bug, i dont really care about it, i mean it still looks good for me, so I'm not going to complain about something so minor. Specially since Square Enix arent really good at porting yet, but as Totalbiscuit said, this is their best port yet.			"

												Pleasantly surprise how good this game is.Probably  the best action rpg of the year.The combat system are really good.  Not very hard to learn. Even mashing away the attacks looks fantastic.  On another note, I recommend playing with gamepad,  xbox 1 control.The switch from 2d side scroller to 3d and to shootem up are done really well. It changes up the game play, and makes the game feels more epic. Especially on boss battle. Hopes square and platinum team up again to make another, but with a tripple A budget.			"

												I would say badly optimized for now, but as future patches come, it should be well fixed. Some issues that are known would be the ""white screen"" where the game white (or black) screens while the game is running. Unfortunately, it will cause you to restart the game, unless you have photographic memory or while you are in the world and be lucky enough to know how to save from that point. TL:DR high chance of getting ""white screened"" before first saveAs mentioned before, there is a 60 fps cap, along with a 30 fps cap for cutscenes (I believe). Too lazy to go into other specifics, but that's what most stood out to me.However, gameplay is amazing, feels like an extremely open-world/freestyle movement and combat system with various customization options. Of course, due to the issues listed above, I can't confirm some of it, but it's my opinion from a first-look blind playthrough. Graphics are also phenomenal <insert 2B butt meme here>, and I would assume this only complements the story even further. Will update as I playthrough, but as for now, until the issues making the game slightly unplayable are fixed, you should wait for a patch before playing.			"

												+ Fluid, responsive gameplay that Platinum has gotten us used to+ Intersting story, though if you haven't seen anything about the original Nier, you're going to miss a lot. Despite not actually needing it to understand what's going on, it adds to the world building.+ Open world that does not feel overwhelming. You never feel completely lost, which is a problem in this type of games.+ Wonderful soundtrack? Multiple playthroughs are necessary to experience everything the game has to offer. Not sure it's a positive or negative, but at this point, it's a tradition in the Drakengard/Nier series- You might start some quests and realize 5 mins later that they are meant for when you have 20-30 more levels, which leads to frustrating deaths.- Fullscreen does not run at 1080p, but windowed 1080 does? Waiting for a patch on this.- Some ocasional quirks with hitboxes when platforming- Not as deep of a combat system as BayonettaNote: Haven't noticed any performance problems other than 30 fps on cutscenes, which is annoying but not really a big problem. Running a through an intel 4790, GTX 970 and 16 Gb Ram.			"

												So, I'll start by saying I'm playing the game at 4K fullscreen and it looks beautiful. I'm not gloating, but rather I'm trying to prove the game isn't a terrible port like other reviews claim. The game has yet to crash for me, and I have no issue keeping a buttery-smooth 60 fps. Anyone can download the game and return it if it doesn't run well on their system. If you've left a bad review just because the game runs poorly on your specific system, then you've done a great disservice to everyone here. Review the game itself, not why your bucket-of-bolts can't run it. If you want to wait for a patch to fix glitches, then wait for it. Don't doom the game to negative reviews while you wait.This game is unquestionably meant to be played with a controller, like the overwhelming majority of ARPGs. You wouldn't play Dark Souls with a mouse and keyboard, so you shouldn't expect to play this with them either. Just because it includes an FPS cap and is designed for controllers doesn't make it a bad PC game. As for the lack of quick saves in the game, I've failed to progress past the first boss twice. When this happens, you get sent back to the very start of the game. First cut scene and all. While some people might find this frustrating, I think it's one of the few games that's brave enough to tell players to git gud. It made me laugh both times. Now that I got that out of my system....The gameplay itself is a variety show. You start out piloting a ship in a game of astroids, then get dropped into melee combat that's equally ARPG and bullet-hell madness. The camera is often fixed and will zoom in-and-out or change to top-down to fit to the environment. This can be frustrating, and players who are bothered by this also won't like invisible walls sectioning off parts of any given area. It's an open world game full of exploration, but the level design keeps you mainly on the correct path at the beginning. I'll update this review to better reflect the entire game once I play more, but overall the game runs smoothly and features inspired combat with an amazing soundtrack. I haven't paid full price for a game in a while, and even though I was skeptical I won't be returning this game. All in all stunning, and I can't wait to push further into the world of NieR.			"

												Thoughts so far- NieR:Automata in the first hour and a half of play has certainly lived up to the hype.Gameplay is fun and versatile, with all kinds of genres of games seamlessly put together to make probably one of the most interesting games to play I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing.I honestly don't  know how Yoko Taro managed to implelent all these styles of gaming without ever making it feeling gimmicky.Combat is fun and fluid, though as with any game you will need a bit of practice to start getting some combos going.I haven't played enough yet to comment on the story (though I have played Drakengard (Dragon Dragoon) and NieR (yes, ending E) so I have some clue, sort of).From what I've seen there have been complaints about this being a bad port and running poorly on PC.I can only speak for myself, but with my GTX 970 this game runs flawlessly at 60fps, I've had to issues with resolution, no crashes, no frame drop, nothing.This of course does not mean you should ignore the people complaining of those issues, 'cause obviously they are issues that really, really need to be addressed, I'm just saying that for me, in my experience this has been a good port.That said, this is a Ps4 game so I would honestly recommend using a controller of some sort, I myself am using the Steam Controller, which is partially supported by Nier. For the sake of this review though I did try out the PC controls, they weren't horrible or extremely clunky by any means, but you could tell that this game was made for a gamepad.End verdict-I definitely would recommend NieR: Automata, if only for the unique experience it provides (though that's definitely not all it's got going for it). If you are worried about the game having issues as some have experienced though, then maybe you should hold off until a patch has been released before you blow £40 on it.I'll rewrite this as a proper review and not just a flurry of first impressions once I've experienced more of the game, so don't hate for the poor formatting.- Maybe I should mention, I don't give a ♥♥♥♥ if cutscenes are capped to 30fps, I'm to play the game so it's the acutal gameplay that matters to me, stop crying over something so pathetic.

												This is a Platinum Games game. As such, it demands more than one playthrough. If you put in around 20-30 hours, you should be able to play through all of it three or four times, while consuming most of the story and lore.If you do this, you get rewarded. While it may seem like a bother, it is well worth your time.NieR:Automata is a hell of a game. Gameplay wise, it is amazing. The combat is as challenging as you want it to be, and can be downright excruciating at times. However, it never ceases to be fun. The story is engaging, and interesting. The characters are loveable, hatable and anything in between. It has a lot of emotion, and a lot of personality. While it isn't the most beautiful game ever made, it is a lot better looking than it ""needs to be"".Keiichi Okabe is in charge of the sound production, so you are in for a serious treat. Emi Evans is also part of the sound staff. This game has THE BEST original soundtracks and atmospheric music I have ever come across. The japanese ending OST gave me chills. This game is meant to be enjoyed with a pair of good headsets or speakers. Soak in the sound and the atmosphere.I haven't had a game experience like this since Mass Effect 2 in 2010.

The story has lots of depth, but not so much so on the first 2 playthroughs.  The game gets so much better after route B.  Worth if you like fun hack and slash boss combat with bullet hell thrown in the mix, if not wait for a sale.Amazing, beautiful game!! (And verrrrryyy challenging if you want it to be, big gap between normal and hard)The dead android bodies of players make it kinda of funny with custom messages, kinda like dark souls. (not typed but selected out of what is available)2b/10(Also the game is fine, not a bad port.  I had no problems at all with everything maxed besides antialiasing and vsync turned off(with 1 GTX 770 with around 30-60 fps and it still looked fine); played on 1920x1080 windowed.  Keyboard controls are fine but weird to get used to, so i used a controller. But if your worried about the port and if it will run ok, dont worry... just don't have way below the minimum specs)			"

												NieR:Automata First halfEmotions felt through the game. Happy, fun lots of fighting awesome bosses, lots of fluid killing and dat *** ,2nd half of the game happens:SADNESS FEELS WHYYY <(:_:)> Sadness continues, more epic fighting and boss battles, more sadness, and end with sad. Realize that there is still 2 more main endings to go, you decide to play through again to get them. Get to 4th ending ending D and cry cause it's a bad ending and just stupid sad. Get to 5th and true ending, you get really frustated with amazing awesome way to unlock 5th ending and become super  happy and DAT ♥♥♥ again.Then after playing for 42 hours you then have all of your save data deleted because you're a cool guy and want to help out other players. PS: After getting all 5 endings the game lets you leave a permanent message for everyone to be able to read when theyre trying to unlock the 5th ending. "

												Shaky release as noted by a lot of users. Including myself, however my issues were not as severe (two crashes so far).Beautifully made game, everything I had hoped for from a hack n slash title made by Platinum Games. With a soundtrack that will make you smile and cry at the same time.Visually speaking this game is a hit or miss, its level design may vary from empty caverns with 2 rock props, or exceptionally well made scenes such as the amusement park. Tied with this is the general pop-in of textures that may bother a lot of people, you will see assets with 128x128 textures transition to their standard resolutions right in front of you. Usage of volumetric lightning is limited but when used its pixelated and generally unpleasant.Limited graphics settings, ambiguos in some regards (the ""Anti-Aliasing"" setting comes to mind, which is in fact high quality MSAA, so do not max it, especially not with the games Ambient Occlusion which adds a pretty decent post-process AA on its own).Remember that this is a Yoko Taro game, the first playthrough does not hold the entire experience.

												There are bad games, there are good games, there are great games, and then are games that blow your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mind and Nier is firmly in the latter category. Just when you think the game has reached peak insanity, just when you think the story has reached peaked insanity, it goes one better.. and then does it again... and again.. and again right up until you've finished the game in a handful of sittings and have no idea what to do next as nothing in your Steam library will compare to what you've just experienced.There are flaws, yes, performance could be better, the cutscenes are poorly rendered, the sidequests aren't all that great (in terms of being fun, story wise they're great), but who cares about any of that when the story is so captivating, when the characters are so captivating, when the soundtrack is godlike, when the combat is a blast to play. I could go on, but I won't. Buy it.			"

												Envolving and brilliantly written leads, a plot that never ceases to shock, gameplay that never keeps you doing the same thing too long and is always throwing something new your way, go in unspoiled, finish it at least three times and you won't regret it.A perfect 10 out of 10 in my book. My only issue was that fullscreen was running an upscaled resolution and there were frequent frame drops, but after using external software to make the game borderless fullscreen, it ran pretty well even in my slightly uncommon resolution (21:9/2560:1080) and my below recommended processor(first generation i5) and video card (GTX 960).Normal is too easy, but Hard is too hard to the point of cheap, so beware. You can save scum by loading the game when you lose your body and frankly I'd recommend it as you can end up losing many hours of progress, but that's very personal I suppose.			"

The odd dip when A LOT of stuff is on screen but nothing gamebreaking. I'm on Crimson driver 16.12.2.

												NieR: Automata is one of those experiences i won't forget.It's enchanting OST, incredibly beautiful visuals, intriguing storyline and most importantly fantastic gameplay leads to a game that you just keep coming back to.My expectations for this game were high and it still managed to greatly surprise with its quality and also makes me want to try the previous games from the series, as it is my first one.What really brought me to this game was it's similarity with Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance since it was developed by the same company and i definitely wasn't left dissapointed, it was absolutely worth paying the full price, many other developers should watch and learn how to make a great fully priced titles.My only complaints would be about the game's optimalization in some places, and the developer's response to them, NieR: Automata has been out for a week and currently there is still no patch that would adress the most prominent issues with their product (although it was announced that they are aware of the game's problems and are working on fixing them).Also i feel like the game could have a bit better side quests and activities, since they can get repetetive after while, but i still might be a bit spoiled from The Witcher 3 so excuse me if i'm being picky.I would also like to give huge Thank You to some of the community members that worked on their own patches in order to fix the fullscreen bug and improve the game's performance, you guys are Gods among men.I hope that Yoko Taro-Senpai will team up with Platinum Games once more in the future to make another great product as it is match made in heaven.My final score for the game is a strong 9/10.

												Never expected this game to be the best game ever. Dark Souls series held the crown a long time but now its time to pass it to another series/game.I didn't expect much from this game. Bought it because im square enix fanboy and saw a bit of combat in trailer way back. Day after release I read some negative reviews and I became really skeptic about game but bought it anyways. (I almost bought Mass effect andromeda. Thank god I didn't.)At start was I was really confused about everything but I was open minded and when I got hang of game mechanics and learned a bit about universe...Oh boy here we go! I kept playing and playing and whenever I didn't play, the game was always on my mind one way or another. (Mostly humming those beautiful OSTs) Love the fact game need to be basicly played 3 times to achieve final ending plus all additional endings.After I finished third playthrough and unlocked chapter select I started grinding achievements and educated myself about original NieR and Drakengard story...Its really deep ♥♥♥♥.TLDR: Amazing combat, Beautiful soundtracks and great voice actors/actress (both, japanese and english), Really immersive universe with deeper story than you can ever imagine.Couple funny and accurate reviews I read earlier,Can dodge bullets but can't dodge tears.It should be illegal for a game to be this good.

												A darn good game hindered by an imperfect port.Pros:-Yoko Taro-Platinum-Stays (mostly) at 60fps-4k-It being a really really good game and fantastic writing all around-Rebindable controls for both Keyboard and GamepadCons:-Fullscreen Mode actually downgrades your resolution on most PCs (from what I've gathered and experienced).  Can be fixed with Borderless Gaming, but the issues shouldn't have been there to begin with.-60fps LOCK  Though not a big deal for me, no unlocked framerate would be a deal-breaker for a lot of action fans.-Basic controls, though good at times and ""manageable"" at worst, may still cause discomfort while you're playing ""claw-grip"" with a majority of the buttons at the same time.-Cutscenes may run at sub-30fps which looks awful at times, especially in climatic scenes.Mehs (whether or not you care):Denuvo DRM   It's been reported that it may cause issues, but that's personally beyond me.  Hard to say since I was never effected by it. Currently Sitting as my GOTY and  the likelihood of anything surpassing it is slim... just hope there are patches in the future.			"

												This game.  This game starts off by confusing the hell out of you if you don't know what to expect.  Which is always fun.I was going to write a long review, but I won't.  Suffice to say, it IS worth buying, it IS awesome, and it IS unique.  You will be confused, but happily, and you will rage, but click Continue anyway.I actually have no idea when the game will end.  26 endings, and some endings are not endings but beginnings.  Cons?  Yes, one or two.  I WISH androids learned how to parry, rather than just dodge.  I WISH combat felt a little bit more visceral, as it's not always evident you actually hit anything.  I WISH the tutorial type beginning was a little more detailed (pod-throwing isn't even mentioned).But hell who cares.  The gameworld is ridiculously superb, the ... let's say, cast, is just awesome.  The music.. my god the music.  It's just impossibly atmospheric, and you absolutely don't care if you hear it over and over.  And then you'll get to a certain point in the game.. and hear it all over again - and you still won't care.Get the unofficial mod.  Set it to your maximum screen and window resolution, to avoid the clunky port upscaling (which I hope SE are going to fix).  Buy vitality pack.  A LOT.  Seriously.  Resist the urge to play on Easy mode, really, don't do it.  When you feel you just HAVE to, refrain from using the autoplay chips.  You'll enjoy the game a lot more if you feel like YOU defeated each boss.  And trust me.. these ARE bosses.  No spoilers.  Just throw away everything you know about other boss fights, as they're pretty useless here.Try to play the game without using a game guide.  When (not if) you get lost, stuck or confused, just backtrack and try again.  If you STILL can't quite figure out what's next, find a spoiler-free guide.  You do NOT want story spoilers here, trust me.Imagination, slightly out-the-box gameplay, stunning storylines.  THIS is what gaming should be about.  I know, after the 100 hours or so it's going to take to finally finish this, I'm going to have a 2B sized gap in my soul.  Next to a Velvet Crowe one.			"

												I just want to thank the developers, this game is really good with an intersting story that tries to catch you off guard not too much as it still wants you to figure out most things before they happen by dropping hints but if you miss some it will suprise you. The game that i though will be action all the way so great way to escape my sadness sadly or ironicly added more sadness and just shatared me. For the few days i had off work i was more depresed then I usualy allow my self to be so I was stuck feeling sad not knowing what to do even when i got the ending E it just made it worst or maybe it was so good and i just though i was sad.Now more on the actual review:Music- its amazing it fits so well even when reading some special text made in the game to learn more about character stories music changes to match the tone of pages you are reading there not too much text so you dont get too bored but enough to explain a lot and the music just made it all the more better. The sound and music this game has is one of the reason you want to keep going as it gets better and better. Gameplay- Platinumgames is behind this one so you know the combat is amazing and it really is its smooth to the point that you want to try ou so many veriation of combat styles like light and heavy weapon or two light weapons first weapons and so on. The amount of combos you can do with different weapons is huge not only that but you can have 2 different sets of weapons that you can change between any time even during combat so you can use 2 light weapons that quicly swap to 2 heavy weapons wihtout stopping your combo making this so much more fun and experimental so you wont get bored any time soon. Only problem is if you play on higher dificulity and you should as normal gets very easy fast once you put in the right chips like auto heal all of a sudden fights dont feel chalanging as much but on higher diff you can use auto aim which sadly on keyboard and mouse set up is pretty bad your mouse while it can aim its rather strange how it does it and you have to keep it moving in some parts constantly to that dirrection you want to shoot in order to keep shooting there or it will reset back to normal and you wont hit flying enemies above its not a horbile thing but still bad enough to cause problem especialy on 1hit and you die difficulity where you need to take out enemies really fast to reduce their numbers to more managable.Characters- Some complained there not enough character development but those people just did not pay any attention as there plenty of it just not as easy to spot. Not only do character change but once you learn more about them you realise why they do what they do or why they stoped doing it, even androids have feelings.Enviroment- The map is good its fun to travel around it and explore and just rewisit some places but eventualy due to side quest you start to lose interest as you have to come back to some places more than 5 times doing something ells over and over when somethign big changes or new area unlocks that fine but when you do nothing other then walk past the same area for the 3rd time as you try to complete side quest you start to get bored of it and just hate having to go back every time. That is not to say side quest are boring some are amazing giving you story about the characters the world or something ells to feel interested in sure some lack any interest as most do in any game but at least some are interesting enough to give you a reason to do them without getting bored out of your mind. there is quick travel but even the climbing in and out animations get annoying so i just started running places my self instead of using it even if it would be way faster i just felt like i rather waste that extra minute than sit and watch my self go in the tranporter.The game is fun and if you played dark souls type of games or like good combat styles game this will suit you well and even then the story it self might be enough for you to have fun untill ninjas start cutting onions. I dont know why I cared about what happened in this game so much sure I always feel sad in games when they drop the sad bombs on you but even then it last about 1h and then back to normal here even after i finished it i was left broken game offered me to save someone after ending E and I did not care what i have to give in return i just clicked it even if it kept warning me of whats at stake. Im glad i played it even if it did not leave me happy and i hope I did save someone in the game with the sacrifice i made at the end.  "

												This is a Platinum Games game. As such, it demands more than one playthrough. If you put in around 20-30 hours, you should be able to play through all of it three or four times, while consuming most of the story and lore.If you do this, you get rewarded. While it may seem like a bother, it is well worth your time.NieR:Automata is a hell of a game. Gameplay wise, it is amazing. The combat is as challenging as you want it to be, and can be downright excruciating at times. However, it never ceases to be fun. The story is engaging, and interesting. The characters are loveable, hatable and anything in between. It has a lot of emotion, and a lot of personality. While it isn't the most beautiful game ever made, it is a lot better looking than it ""needs to be"".Keiichi Okabe is in charge of the sound production, so you are in for a serious treat. Emi Evans is also part of the sound staff. This game has THE BEST original soundtracks and atmospheric music I have ever come across. The japanese ending OST gave me chills. This game is meant to be enjoyed with a pair of good headsets or speakers. Soak in the sound and the atmosphere.I haven't had a game experience like this since Mass Effect 2 in 2010. It is a lot better than ME2. In my eyes, this game is a solid 10/10. Best game I ever played.			"

												This game is probably one of my top 5 games of all time. The story is told so perfectly. I played this game for only a couple of days because it was just impossible to put down. Yoko Taro has outdone himself. Having not played the original Nier games, there was some confusion at first, but even so the game does a good job of leaving hints for you to find. On top of that, Keiichi Okabe's score is breathtaking. Not only are the tracks well-done, but each song has been tailor made for the mood of the area or time. If you play on the higher difficulties, there are some awful parts that you might die at, but overall it's well-paced and the checkpoints are plentiful, but not overwhelming. If you want the best experience, I'd recommend doing the first mission on normal, and then switching the difficulty to hard or very hard.This is not a game I'll soon forget. Not for the butt, which to be honest is glorious on its own, but actually for the game itself. If you have the chance, buy this game, whether it's on sale or not, it's worth every penny.			"

												Every once in a while there will be a game i don`t really care about, until i get curious why everybody seems to like it so much. NieR Automata is exactly that game. Curious -> bought it -> tried it -> fell in love.This game is one of the best i have played in the last 10 years or so. It is full of interesting ideas, great characters, it`s funny at times and serious when it needs to be. I never got bored with the gameplay, it always mixes it up. So, awesome game, lovely characters and great music. Buy the game and find the fullscreen fix here on Steam and i runs great.			"

												I was told by a friend that this was one of the best games he has ever played, and I'm inclined to agree. I played for 13 hours straight the first time I launched it, and only stopped because it was 5am and I had to wake up in 2 hours. The gameplay is fantastic, the soundtrack is absolutely phenominal, and the only real issues I have with it are the textures look blurry in cutscenes, and it doesn't play nice in fullscreen. It really caters to its players, with difficulty settings ranging from extreme casual to extreme masochist depending on your choice of difficulty and Plug-in Chips, and has nice features like being able to reduce potential motion sickness from the camera, or changing the tone on things for the hearing impared. I absolutely recommend playing this game, even if you're new to bullet-hell and hack and slash style games, and it is worth every cent full price.			"

												This is a Platinum Games game. As such, it demands more than one playthrough. If you put in around 20-30 hours, you should be able to play through all of it three or four times, while consuming most of the story and lore.If you do this, you get rewarded. While it may seem like a bother, it is well worth your time.NieR:Automata is a hell of a game. Gameplay wise, it is amazing. The combat is as challenging as you want it to be, and can be downright excruciating at times. However, it never ceases to be fun. The story is engaging, and interesting. The characters are loveable, hatable and anything in between. It has a lot of emotion, and a lot of personality. While it isn't the most beautiful game ever made, it is a lot better looking than it ""needs to be"".Keiichi Okabe is in charge of the sound production, so you are in for a serious treat. Emi Evans is also part of the sound staff. This game has THE BEST original soundtracks and atmospheric music I have ever come across. The japanese ending OST gave me chills. This game is meant to be enjoyed with a pair of good headsets or speakers. Soak in the sound and the atmosphere.I haven't had a game experience like this since Mass Effect 2 in 2010. It is a lot better than ME2. In my eyes, this game is a solid 10/10. Best game I ever played.			"

												Excellent game, but terrible PC optimization.I'll start with this issue: the optimization is awful. It had me drop the game's resolution to 1600x1200 while my screen can support 1980x1080, and even this sacrifice couldn't make me play at more than 30FPS (mostly 25 in open world) with medium settings. It's been very hard to adapt to such low FPS. Furthermore, the keyboard controls (yes, I forgot my controller at home before leaving but couldn't wait to get it back to start playing this game) include some issues such as the dodging system, which requires you to double tap a direction key (WASD) instead of taping one key while moving. Navigating between usable items without opening the main menu is pretty tough as well, so what I did basically was binding the keys to my mouse and it works just fine.Enough of these system issues, let's now talk about the game. It is a true masterpiece. The main scenario is great, even though it is a little bit too short, but it doesn't really matter because the game is based on replaying the story several times to get every single spark of awesomeness this game can bring. The sidequests are even more excellent, the feeling of saving a fellow android or seeing machines think about what they can bring to the world they live in is a great experience and made me think about our own life as humans.In addition to a incredible scenario, what I HAVE to talk about is the OST. IT. IS. AMAZING! I seldom heared anything that good in a videogame to be honest. Chills, tears, happiness, fear, motivation, these are 5 of the countless feelings the different soundtracks brought me while playing. They contribute widely to an absolutely immersing environment.I could give more and more good points, but I have to make it a bit shorter (eh), so I'll just write down the only thing that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off: I really didn't enjoy being forced to playing 9S while doing some VERY important sidequests or roaming to find hidden chests. I think every character should've acquired the ability of hacking after completing routes A, B and C/D. Don't get me wrong, I like the character and the way it evolves through the entire story, but damn I would just like to play the other characters! But they keep forcing me into playing him because he's the only one who can hack things.Anyway, I HIGHLY recommend this game for anyone who likes RPG's. Though I think the PC version is not optimized at all, I think a better PC setup would actually make it run way more smoothely than my PC does. Still, running it in HQ would require a very powerful setup in my opinion.Have fun playing NieR: Automata!			"

From a soundtrack direction it simply has the finest songs from the last 10 years: Beautiful , sad , emotional that breaks your heart in to pieces. From a gameplay point of view is complete and fill with deep mechanics and 2d/4 wall breaking levels. It's just a complete package traying to reach perfection . Nier automata will be remember in the history of mankind as Art in the very best definition. I can't keep writing because there is too much talk i don't want to spoil this ride.

												I played about 80 Hours and got the plat trophy for the Japanese PS4 version. I won't say too much about the story, but if you have even a little interest in this game, you owe it to yourself to make sure you start your 3rd playthrough, just trust me. The gameplay isn't flawless, Platinum rarely is, you tend to get their extreme highs along with some rough edges. Theres some bland boss segments, a forced walking segment with enemies who can attack and stagger you(just an aggravating moment at a high story beat). The space shooter stuff is fun, but too easy, probably figured the play testers had trouble and toned it down or something. ♥♥♥♥it, the good is way better than the slightly agitating.Overall, the original Nier is a masterpiece of storytelling, but the gameplay is far from refined. I feel confident saying that Nier: Automata doesn't just bring an extremely good story and characters without making you deal with mediocre gameplay, but Nier:Automata brings all the Yoko Taro story with truly wonderful, smooth and satisfying P+ gameplay. You know that feeling you get the moment you control a Platinum game? Yeah, you get that and a lot of feels, what more could you want.			"

												At around 15 hours with this game I reached ending A. At that point I thought I had a pretty solid grasp of this game, and I was impressed enough to write a review (first time I've ever done that). After another 15 hours and 7 more endings, I can say with absolute confidence that ending A was nowhere nier (ha) what this game has to offer. This game truly blew me away.The story of this game starts off intriguing but a bit slow. Stick with it however, and you'll be rewarded with an above average experience as you finish ending A. However, the game truly shines once you return to the menu and start the game again. Side quests and boss encounters that seemed mysterious or pointless are suddenly filled with meaning and powerful emotion. The characters and their relationships are fleshed out so much further that you feel a genuine connection to all of them. The gameplay continues to astound and never ceases to surprise. Although 26 endings may be too many for some people, you really only have to play to ending E in order to experience the ""main"" story of the game and this is absolutely worth it. I cannot possibly give this game a higher recommendation. Nier:Automata is a masterpiece and has reached my top 5 games of all time list and I hope that you give it a shot too. And if all this doesn't convince you at least give it a shot for 2B's ♥♥♥...tounding sword skills ;).			"

												Never had much fun within the first hour of a game in a very long time. NieR:Automata™ grabs the hack-and-slash third person genre and combines it with some bullet hell elements. Even though camera can be clunky at times, its all about finding the right ""angles"". This was the first game ever that I've played that I actually changed mouse to keyboard multiple times during fights making it a new fresh concept and fun mechanic personally. The soundtrack is nice and the graphics is phenomenal, and I haven't encountered any issues with the game so far. The characters are memorable and overall, I think I'm going to enjoy this.			"

												Overall, a pretty good game, though you'll need a higher-end computer to play it without issues. NieR Automata is a sequel to the previous NieR game (though playing the prequel is not required) which is itself a spinoff of the fifth ending of the game Drakengard, which, again, is not required. NieR: Automata does a good job of introducing the characters and setting in a way that doesn't feel like a huge infodump.In terms of gameplay, it feels reminiscent of Dark Souls, in that if you die, instead of dropping all your Souls, you drop any plug-in chips you had equipped (the equivalent of skills, there is huge room for customization, particularly because you only have limited space, and more advanced chips take up more space) and a small amount of experience. If you make it back to your body without dying, you can reclaim the items you dropped (but not if you die en route). If you really want a challenge, the hardest difficulty (difficulty can be changed mid-game) causes you to die in one hit (the evade button is your friend). However, even on Easy, you can't get complacent, because there are enemies that can still oneshot you. Easy difficulty also has a number of ""auto-battle"" chips that you can equip, that do things like auto-shoot, auto-dodge, auto-melee that can be equipped at your leisure (and can only be equipped on Easy).The default keyboard/mouse controls are a little wonky if you don't rebind them (like \ and / being your melee attack binds, and left/right shift being your ranged attack binds), but there is the option to do so.There are also a ton of fun easter eggs, like a Steam Achievement for looking up 2B's skirt 10 times, or how if you self-destruct in the space station you blow it up and the game ends. Pros:-Fantastic combat system that feels fluid and responsive.-Great story-Voice acting is pretty good-Soundtrack is baller-You'll only get loading screens if you fast travel or die.Cons:-Highish minimum specs required to play the game above low graphics.-Fullscreen bug (alt-tabbing changes it to windowed mode)-The cutscenes are pre-rendered and can have framerate dips.-Much like Dark Souls, you'll have a better time playing this on a controller than with a Keyboard/Mouse. Unlike Dark Souls, it's very much playable with Keyboard/Mouse controls though.			"

Pure action with some layers of JRPG elements. Fantastic soundtrack. Performance kind of sucks if you play on 1080 resolution or higher. Also, play this on a controller and go into it as a classic console experience.  If you grew up playing games like Devil May Cry and Metal Gear Solid, then go for NieR: Automata.

												Let's face it, this port is seriously sub-par. Fullscreen only has one resolution that works, cutscenes are jerky and have weird bars at the top and bottom of the screen, and the game just doesn't seem to know how to load anything. Hacking during combat is immersion breaking because it sometimes takes up to 10 seconds for the minigame to appear. I once stepped into a room only to watch all of the npcs in it fall into a bottomless pit, because they spawned before the floor did.But the fact is, I would still recommend this game. The gameplay is fun and engaging, though you'll want a gamepad and to rebind some controls unless you have two thumbs on your right hand. Even on higher difficulties, whenever you die it's because of a mistake you made and that's what makes me want to keep trying at it. The soundtrack is beyond excellent. The story and characters are compelling, and only get moreso as the game continues.If you think the port issues are going to be too much of an issue for you, hold off until this gets some patches. Otherwise, this is a great game that should absolutely be on your list.			"

												Pleasantly surprise how good this game is.Probably  the best action rpg of the year.The combat system are really good.  Not very hard to learn. Even mashing away the attacks looks fantastic.  On another note, I recommend playing with gamepad,  xbox 1 control.The switch from 2d side scroller to 3d and to shootem up are done really well. It changes up the game play, and makes the game feels more epic. Especially on boss battle. Hopes square and platinum team up again to make another, but with a tripple A budget.			"

												I love it a lot, and I use a television with the sharpness turned to 0.I also have a low end processor (with a lot of cooling) and a GTX 680, with 16gb of ram and I can run this game VERY well as long as I have anti-aliasing turned off. I can have all the other settings on high.Windowed mode is lame but the UI has no issue with it and I am completely immersed anyway.I can't say I enjoyed any other game this much, by just ignoring the main mission and exploring and doing side missions. Characters and detail, being able to kill 20 levels higher than me is very addicting, so I know nothing about the main story yet LOL.That means... back to it!			"

												I bought this game really not expecting much, boy... this turned my world upside down.I was marked by the profound thoughts you do get from this game. And had my self asking what differentiates us from machines... It is actually a good question.. This game gives an understanding of certain things and gave me alot of hard descisions and tears. But dam it is worth it. The mental pain almost feels real at one moment. And that is something ive never been able to experience in any other video game ive ever played. This is an amazing game. I do truly give props to the creators. I have yet to see this level of worksmanship on any other game. I could go on about this but some things need to be found out for themselves. Whatever you do, do not give up, we are with you.I recommend this game to just about anyone of course of proper maturity to understand what this game has to offer truly. Also graphics 7.5/10 they dont need to be better thoughStory :  12.5/10Music : 10/10Combat gameplay : 9/10 a bit difficult and annoying from time to timePhilosophy, tears, feelings and emotion OVER 9000!!!! /10			"

												Yoko Taro finally had his dream come true with having a studio: Platinum Games, capable of creating what he's envisioned properly. The biggest gripe of any of his games has been the gameplay whereas the plot has been one spectacle after another. If you don't know of the prior games it goes in this order:Drakengard 3 - Drakengard - Nier - Nier: AutomataNo knowledge of the former games are really needed except maybe Nier and Ending E on Drakengard. But those get explained fairly well in data-logs littered in the latter sections of Automata. To get the elephant out of the room immediately, the plot is good. It's developed at a reasonable pace and you're introduced to things as slowly as was possible in the oddity of a world. Things that initially made no sense and which I thought were products of bad writing were actually hidden meanings that you don't grasp until you fully explore the game. There's an open-amount of content unless more things become discovered to allow for each person to theorize how many of the plot elements came about. I think the fact that the plot can encourage such long conversations over the material is enough reason for anyone to understand that something meaningful is there.The gameplay is solid all around and it's how should I say... unique? The game was displayed as this Action-RPG game but is instead an Action-RPG, SHMUP, and Metroidvania styled game all rolled up into a great big jawbreaker. The elements come at a varied pace so it doesn't feel repetitive as you progress. To me the game reminded me SO MUCH of Kingdom Hearts, not the ones with QTEs but the original game but maybe it was just me.The music also gets a huge plus as I've followed since D3, Nier, and now Automata and the composer has only grown better with time. I had such high hopes for this OST and they managed to outdo my expectations.There are some elements I dislike about the game but it goes into mechanics for spoiler stuff so I'll leave it alone, all of the things I have 'problems' with could stem from me having sped through the game and playing nonstop but quite frankly I just couldn't put this game down until it was completed.SO PLAY THE GAME. FIND IT ALL OUT AND EXPERIENCE IT.Don't go looking for help, just go into this game blind and you'll come out completely blown away. Avoid spoilers with all of your strength. And remember to just keep going. You'll reach a point where you think you can't. But you can.			"

												This game is probably one of my top 5 games of all time. The story is told so perfectly. I played this game for only a couple of days because it was just impossible to put down. Yoko Taro has outdone himself. Having not played the original Nier games, there was some confusion at first, but even so the game does a good job of leaving hints for you to find. On top of that, Keiichi Okabe's score is breathtaking. Not only are the tracks well-done, but each song has been tailor made for the mood of the area or time. If you play on the higher difficulties, there are some awful parts that you might die at, but overall it's well-paced and the checkpoints are plentiful, but not overwhelming. If you want the best experience, I'd recommend doing the first mission on normal, and then switching the difficulty to hard or very hard.This is not a game I'll soon forget. Not for the butt, which to be honest is glorious on its own, but actually for the game itself. If you have the chance, buy this game, whether it's on sale or not, it's worth every penny.			"

												I'm not usually compelled to write steam reviews, but this game touched me in a special way. A gentle curess, that turned into an inappropriate touch, that turned into a slap in the face, that turned into warm feels. The game had me hooked from the first scene and didn't let go until the very end. Almost literally, the game let me go, told me ""Thanks for Playing"". Gave me some leftovers to bring home.If you liked Devil May Cry, Beyonetta, God of War, Final Fantasy, Geometry Wars... Hell if you don't even like those games give this one a try.It's just one big feels trip with a good story, great gameplay, and interesting mechanics.Also, don't get put off with the multiple endings thing. If anything consider them ""chapters"" Chapter A, B, C. For maximum feels I recommend going through to E, it's what compelled me to write this review. Anyway, I'm exausted and I can't write when I'm at 100%. I hope you read through my gibberish and took something out of it.			"

												I'm not horribly far into this game but it's a sleeper. I was a huge fan of the original Nier with no experience with the Drakenguard series. I have a Radeon 400 series GPU and suffered through the white screen issues but managed to get it fixed. I'm trailing off though..... Great soundtrack; I mean EPIC! The story is very intruiging and has me sucked in completely. In regards to the combat and overall gameplay it's so well put together. No button mashing for the win here. It's tactical but easy enough to grasp. I'm a huge Souls Series fan so this is a nice medium. Love the customization of your weaponry and pods. Another big thing to appreciate is all the different game styles the are able to get in (Bullet Hell, 2D, 2.5D, Flight, Top-Down, and 3D action). It has alot to offer without being overkill.

												I would say badly optimized for now, but as future patches come, it should be well fixed. Some issues that are known would be the ""white screen"" where the game white (or black) screens while the game is running. Unfortunately, it will cause you to restart the game, unless you have photographic memory or while you are in the world and be lucky enough to know how to save from that point. TL:DR high chance of getting ""white screened"" before first saveAs mentioned before, there is a 60 fps cap, along with a 30 fps cap for cutscenes (I believe). Too lazy to go into other specifics, but that's what most stood out to me.However, gameplay is amazing, feels like an extremely open-world/freestyle movement and combat system with various customization options. Of course, due to the issues listed above, I can't confirm some of it, but it's my opinion from a first-look blind playthrough. Graphics are also phenomenal <insert 2B butt meme here>, and I would assume this only complements the story even further. Will update as I playthrough, but as for now, until the issues making the game slightly unplayable are fixed, you should wait for a patch before playing.			"

												After completing my first playthrough, I have now decided to write a review. Pros:+ Very fun third person action similar to DMC, but not as in-depth. There are some cool combos you can do but after a while it gets repetitive and you can only mix and match so much+ Large world that you can explore as much as you want as well as a plethora of side-quests which can get a little overwhelming but you are free to do them at your pace+ Really good story although I wouldn't necessarily call it a masterpiece but that may change with subsequent playthroughsCons:- Maybe it's just me but the world kind of felt a little fake to me. It just didn't seem natural to me and didn't make me think to myself that this world could actually exist. Hard to explain. Due to this it was hard to get immersed in it.- 9S kinda annoyed me as I prefer to be aloneThe cons are not game-breaking obviously and are just my own personal thoughts on the world and 9S. But otherwise a solid game and recommended. Make sure you install FAR patch on steam discussion forums to get performance boost and fix any bugs with fullscreen.			"

												If you like hack-and-slash gameplay with unique combo variations, with a great story/OST then this game is for you. Also, if you're a fan of Final Fantasy games, but dislike the turn-based style of gameplay then this game is ESPECIALLY for you. Using a keyboard and mouse is a little wonky feeling at first, but getting used to it is pretty easy. I recommend a controller for this game, however you can still play with a keyboard and mouse just fine.However, I do believe after you hit level 80 there is virtually no challenge (unless you want to play where anything in the game can 1shot you on the esteem'd ""very hard"" mode). I hope that the developers add more stuff to this game for the level 99-hard difficulty players like myself!10/10			"

												I have to say I was very much looking forward to Nier, and I was not disappointed in the slightest. I know you don't want me to get into a long paragraph so i'll hop into the pros, cons, and then what I think about NieR as a whole.PROS:-Great visuals-Great audio and music-Combat feels smooth and fluid-The voice acting is good-I find myself caring and sympathizing for the major characters-Gives a Dark Souls esk feel to a certain degree-The world is large, open, vibrant, and rewards exploration. With the world having a large sence of contrast between different areas.-Interesting story that gets right into it and doesn't break flow very often-Constantly switches to and from third person and top down combat that keeps things fresh and from getting to staleCONS:-Not everything is voice acted. There are quite a few conversations between characters, even early on in the game, that have no voices from either character that really kills the flow and immersion. Though for everything story related is fully voice acted.-The cutscenes are nowhere near 60fps, so if you run the game at a constant 60, then a cutscene pops up, it will seem very laggy.In conclusion I full heatedly recommend NieR:automana to anyone who is thinking about buying it. The amount of content, as well as the quality of it, you get within the game is well worth the $60 price tag. I've been hearing a lot about people having constant crashes with the game ot bugs with fullscreen, however, in the time I have played so far I haven't encountered a single issue so far.			"

												Updated: Clean-up, tl:dr for those who don't like to read through a thesis.Possible spoilers ahead.Saw the trailer last February amongst many other recommendations of cat videos(thanks youtube) and thought its awesome and was going to be a console exclusive but then saw that it was going to be on steam. I really enjoyed Bayonetta on XBOX, so since its from platinum I was excited because I haven't played any since then. I tried not to give in to the hype and managed to hold on for a few days but the train ran me over and next thing I knew I had already pre-ordered(THE VALVE ACCESSORIES ARE F'KIN UGLY!!!). I was concerned because of the pre-order ♥♥♥♥storm in recent games and this is the only game I have pre-ordered ever. So to console myself I thought, 'if anything I'll just be satisfied from seeing 2B's butt' and only had expectations on 2B's backside. Woah this is one long prelude, I dont read and write reviews so forgive this wall of text.Butt I will write this anyway because I can't stop thinking about the game and can't sleep properly. I Played it 3 days straight from release with a few hours of sleep and got mindhumped. How the whole plot unfolded was probably how it made my eyes sweat a little bit, every character's part in the whole campaign against the enemy and their fate when it all ends.THE SOUNDTRACK!       I usually turn off the music/BGM everytime I start a game, but (very)fortunately for me the game did not allow me to mute it on the first screen and totally forgot to set it in-game, so I got to hear amazingly beautiful music(literally makes my head tingle every time, I hope it's not cancer). First time I've laid down controls just to listen to the BGM. I think plenty of thought has been put into the soundtrack and how they're implemented during in-game events. The track that plays on your first encounter with Adam & Eve(this cannot continue?) is a good example, it is a strange(ly good) tune but it captures the feeling of the event. Another good one is on a certain ending, once you accept an assistance offer, a whole choir starts to hum/sing with the theme song which is amazing(the songs included). The ending theme songs are awesome, they all relate to the circumstance, motivations and attitudes of the characters.Gameplay       I never expected a DMC/Bayonetta level of combat depth because it is a mash of multiple genres after all, but still the mechanics are very solid and is still very enjoyable. I really prefer the swordplay so 9S' playthrough felt less enjoyable since his move set doesn't appeal as much as the others. 'Open-world' - Environment stays true to the game's setting with bland colours throughout. It is small but enough for farming materials/chips or mindlessly slashing everything that moves. Eploration will reward you with fragments of background story information(archive entries mostly) so it's worth doing if you want to understand the whole plot. Raises a problem if you're a farmer like me where at some point your level will be way higher than the next story mission and you'll just be breezing through some stages. Controller/Gamepad - Not absolutely necessary, but will significantly improve your whole experience with the game especially with the shooter/bullet hell parts. They've allowed us to change keybindings with the kb&m, but there is just very little else to do for those who do not have controllers/gamepads. Besides you really don't expect the best experience with kb&m for this kind of game right?Performance       No complaints, dont really care about super fancy graphics. 2B's bottom still looks fabulous on my screen even on upscaled resolution. game runs at constant 60fps(1600x900 upscaled) on AMD R9 280x, blur & AA off all else max, might crash if you insist on clearing it alone, no other issues since launch. Issues - upscaling resolution, probably the only issue for me but I don't particularly mind because it allows me to ramp up the settings without performance loss(game still looks beautiful imo)and I have a relatively small monitor(1600x900). I have tried it with borderless gaming, it works great and everything looks crisp and better in true native resolution however framerate did go down 55 on a crowded battle and experienced noticable screen tearing(v-sync doesnt seem to work in window mode), it is possible to run better if settings are lowered.Story       Made my eyes sweat, can't stop thinking of the game after I cleared it. The different playthroughs will give you different perspectives of the story and insights to the character's attitudes and motivations. Doing the side quests will give you a better idea of the whole situation(how goes the fight and how the non main characters feel), plenty of philosophical questions too to fry your neurons. I have never played a lot of story heavy games, I can only think of Witcher 3, which could be the reason why I got blown away by this game. But whatever the case it was an amazing experience, alot of emotions, never had anything like it. I suggest you read the archive entries if you want to make better sense of all the things that are happening, it will really allow you to appreciate the story better.THE END      I think my system has cleared all that caffeine, so I'll go back to my corner and wait for another amazing fish to swim down the river. Maybe I'll try and clear hard with bare fists while I wait.Thanks to the selfless people who sacrificed their hard work to help out in the [E]nding.Square Enix, the true final boss.Supposed happy ending made me feel sadder than I expected.I hope this game doesn't get overshadowed by other big releases this season.I wish I could erase the memory of playing the game so I could experience the same high.Honestly though I got fished by sexy android bottoms on the trailers, I'm so glad I got a lot more than what I came in for.Futility & Irony.Awesome trip, totally worth it.If you've read all of this reflection paper pretending to be a review, you should just buy the game, seriously, you know you really like it if you read through all of this (ง°ل͜°)ง. I wonder if I can submit this 1000+word 'review' for my midterm paper realteer: GREAT BACKSIDE COVERAGE, BEAUTIFUL SOUNDTRACK, GREAT DESIGN, GREAT STORY, SOLID COMBAT MECHANICS & ANIMATIONS, AMAZING GAME, ALL OF IT![/b].

												Pros - Everything except the box-pushing speed.Cons - Box-pushing speed could be a little quicker. Nier and Drakengard aren't on PC so I have to buy those and borrow a PS3 now. Meh - Got a little tired of seeing the factory but everything is so engaging, even if the environments get a little repetitive, that it's not a big deal. I kinda want to play again already.Make sure you stick around for the third playthrough, so much happens. 10/10			"

If you love good games there's nothing that should prevent you from buying this game.But please, please play the first NieR before Automata, or at least watch it on youtube.

												This is how RPG's should be. This is a true JRPG. One of the best games I have enjoyed so much in years, this will go down as one of my most beloved games rivaling even those from my childhood. Thank you Yoko Taro and PlatinumGames for this beautiful game a thought-provoking story.If you enjoy RPG's and an actual good story, please you owe it to yourself to play this, and be sure to get to a third playthrough as NG+ feature is something that's a gamechanger in this franchise.EDIT: After my 3rd playthrough I can stand by what I had originally said. By the 3rd ending credits for ending E I was nearly in tears shooting at words. I was so caught up in the moment that I agreed to the deletion (WARNING THE DELETION IS REAL) while I do regret my nearly 100% clear I will likely in the future pick this up again and clear it. This game really grows on your heart.			"

												Game kicked my ♥♥♥ for 9 hours in the first mission(I love hard mode, since witcher 3). 42 hours later, I got nothing to show for it, other than achievements and missing bosses I'll have to grind back to.The game is damn good, I mean, while the story is kinda easy to predict, it's still worth going for it. Gameplay has all all the variety from Platinum and a bit more, you got guns, barehand, swords, greatswords, spears, lasers, missiles, super-tech-magic stuff, and you can combine it to suit your style(combat bracers and spears were my groove there).As for a Yoko Taro story, it's my first one, I really liked it, though, I don't think I'll be tackling all of Drakengard and NIer any time soon. The visuals are really cool. The whole world is not that big, dont' expect Skyrim size of open world, but very varied. The character design was astounding. Though, I was never a fan or A2's design. I guess we all have our favorites.Now, on to the technical issues, this game has them, in spades, sadly, not well optimized, prone to freezing, graphical crashes, that 900p. They were not a deal breaker for me, since I saved often, and I play modded Skyrim, so I got CTDs down. I really hope they fix it, since they are only technical issues, they are meant to be fixed at some point or well, look around for workarounds, that's PC gaming for ya.Aside from that, totally recommmended, at least get it during a steam offer or for like a 20% discount.

												I'll start my review by saying that I have never been more satisfied with a video game purchase in my life. I knew what I wanted from this game, and it gave me exactly that -- I don't think any game no matter how good has given me exactly what I wanted. I mean, if it says anything, I think this is the only game I have ever not just 100%, but actually read every single tiny bit of side dialogue, every snippet, archive, and tiny bit of information I could get my hands on. That's impressive, when you compare it my time in Elder Scrolls games or even the Witcher 3, where I read maybe a few books out of the dozens in those games.NieR:Automata is a superb experience for anyone looking for a puzzling but not unpredictable story, with characters that all grow on you the longer you play. A lot of the cast I didn't even like at first, but as the game continued, I feel like I became more attached to them than a lot of more fleshed out characters in other games. That's quite impressive. Understanding why a character is the way they are is very satisfying, the the cast plays so well off of each other -- 2B and 9S's dialogue with each other specifically I found very charming. The gameplay itself is certainly a very nice blend of the original Nier and Platinum's usual affair. It's not wholly my cup of tea, as I prefer more concise combat engines, but for what it is, it is very responsive, satisfying and decently skillful. Sort of a 3rd person bullet hell at certain times, which can in certain instances in the game be a bit... hard to see, if nothing else. There is a lot of running around though, especially if you want to 100% the game, so prepare yourself for that if you're a completionist like myself. The sound design is also great, from the voice acting, sounds and the absolutely breath-taking OST, which I know is already going to be playing on loop for me for the next few months. I don't think it'll be everyone's cup of tea, as it involves of vocal elements, but to say it doesn't fit the game would be a downright lie. Some of the songs setup scenes and emotional responses so well it's -- well, it's nicely done, I'll be modest about it, heh heh.I guess this is the part where I just do pros and cons:Pros:- Great Story, that is possible to predict but can be quite puzzling -- which to me are the best kind of stories- Characters are very enjoyable and unique- Well written, very little dialogue felt off to me- No requirement to have played the first Nier, although it makes you appreciate the game more- Combat is fast-paced and skillful enough to keep you focused, while mindless enough when you're just treking away- Decent amount of character customization which opens up a lot of playstyles- Music is astounding- SFX is also really nice- Can alter the difficulty whenever and it has no hidden meaning other than challenge (no hard only endings)- 100%ing the game is at least convenient to do end-game, but it is tedious- World I would say is ""just"" the right size to not be overwhelming- Contains a few moments which will stick with you forever (a guarantee from me)Cons:- PC version has issues (resolution in full screen, shaky optimization at times)- A lot of running around- Certain side characters and areas COULD have been more fleshed out- Dialogue for side-NPCs rarely changes and acknowledges events (though I understand why)- Exploration ""can"" be rewarding, but is very tedious- Poor character balance (I don't mind in single player games, but it is very blatant that some weapons/sub weapons are way better than others)- Normal to Hard mode difficulty is mostly a damage scaling alteration, which can be annoying when some random projectiles might one shot on hard, but others won't - can be hard to tell, so slot max HP UP, heh heh- Completionists, prepare for a bit of randomness and farming- You won't want to go to work until you finish the storyOverall:I don't think every person is going to enjoy this game as much as I did, but if you're looking for something that will satisfy your desire for an intriguing story, that is not afraid to pull punches, then you may well enjoy this game as much as I did. This game climbed as I played it from okay, to great, to now being in my top 3 favorite games of all time. There's thousands of games to contend with, so if that intrigues you, I challenge you to find out whether this game deserves ""2B"" in your own top list! "

												I always thought that a great video game is a sum of its' parts. I always thought it's alll about combining engaging mechanics with a compelling story. When you judge individual aspects of this game, it's all far from remarkable. The combat is good, but Platinum has delivered much better games. The story is interesting but there's enough ridiculous plotholes  to drive anyone insane. The RPG elements and the questing system are functional but you could find similar systems done better in many games. Yet, having said all that, Nier Automata is one of the most special gaming experiences I've ever had in my life. Before playing Nier Automata I was simply unaware that a video game is capable of evoking such strong emotions in the player. Mr. Taro's masterpiece is a game that will  remain in your memory until the day you die. I don't want to talk about the specifics because literally anything I say could be considered a spoiler. I'll just say this: If you happen to harbor deep love for gaming as a medium, not playing Nier Automata would be a crime. If you want games to evolve beyond silly shooters for teenagers, this is it. It's a game that will not only make you appreciate video games. It will also make you appreciate fellow human beings and the constant everyday struggle most of us find ourselves inArigatou Gozaimasu Taro San  P.S:. 9s is supposed to be annoying, it's not bad VO, like the internet seems to be claiming :P Just give it some time.

												I rarely finish games. I play 10-20 hours of them, then get distracted by something else and move on. In my 15+ years of playing games, I can count the number of games that I've finished on two hands. After 60 hours of playing, I just finished all major endings of NieR: Automata. This game, far moreso than any long RPG I've ever touched, does everything it can to remain engaging throughout. I was still being surprised and delighted up to the very end -- and I mean the VERY end. It flirts with your expectations of what will and even CAN happen, and it does so with a confidence rarely seen in the RPG world.Without spewing out lines and lines of expository dialogue at every turn, it makes you care about characters, shows them change, breaks your heart, and manages to showcase an uncommonly nihilistic perspective while still, somehow, feeling uplifting.Oh, and despite all its experimentation, it sits on a foundation of incredibly polished and satisfying gameplay. Really, I can think of few negatives. Its less-than-AAA budget is clear, leading to some kind of empty environments and a lot of invisible walls. Also, the unnecessarily sexualized outfits of the main female characters wasn't great, but the sexualization begins and ends with the outfits, which is refreshing--the characters, animations, and most importantly, the camera never objectify the characters. So, unlike most cases, it really is a minor complaint.NieR: Automata has easily made it into the list of the most memorable and influencial video game experiences of my life. But because of its nature, it's really difficult to say any more without spoiling the experience. All I'll say is that the way it uses the medium of video games to tell its story is wholely unique and unforgettable.			"

												One of the best games I have ever played, full stop. Amazing story, great combat, fantastic writing and absolutely beautiful music. Nier Automata has some of the best voice acting I've ever heard in any medium and it really brings the characters to life in a way that you have to see to believe. The PC version has some issues that can be fixed with a fan-made patch but it's still worth mentioning that this port is far from perfect. With the fix however almost all of its issues are completely negated.I would highly recommend this game to anyone regardless of tastes or genre interests, and at any price. It's quite frankly the best game I've played in years. Worth mentioning that no prior knowledge of the series is required. I have no experience with Nier beyond Automata, although after finishing it I'm desperate to play more.			"

												Confession: I'm honestly just going to gush about the game. If you're looking for a more in-depth, critical review, I'm afraid I can't help. If you're looking to read the ramblings of someone who just finished the game, then welcome.You might think that this is a game about androids destroying robots in the distant future.Well, you'd be right, actually. But it becomes so much more than that, to the point I don't even have words to describe it. If there was ever a game I'd say is a 'must buy', it just got knocked off the shelf and replaced by NieR:Automata, possibly for all time.Now, a heads-up: this is kinda a poor port, and i struggled with driver crashes and resolution issues (the latter I didn't entirely care about, however). That being said, I'm normally picky about that sort of thing, yet I pulled through and didn't let it hamper my enjoyment of the game much at all.I played through the entire game on Hard, and would heartily reccomend it. Granted, yes, the prologue can be fairly difficult, and you are unable to save until you've completed it, but I would nonetheless reccomend it - sharpening your combat skills that early on will go a long way, believe me. Of course, you can change the difficulty at any time, and there are NO achievements for beating the game on a certain difficulty. As I said, I reccomend Hard, but that's for a combination of Story and gameplay. If you just want to experience the story (and props to you if you do, it's amazing!), Normal is more than enough.The story is...admittedly convoluted and philosophical as hell, but that's what makes it so...beautiful.What does it mean to be human? To be an android? To be a machine?To be alive?To be?What does ANYTHING mean?Is it a simple difference of parts and logic circuits, or something more?The way NieR:Automata tells its story is unlike anything I've ever seen, and the endings (there's 26 of them!) are each  magnificent (and sometimes hilarious), ESPECIALLY the true ending. You owe it to yourself to leap in as blind as possible, and experience all that the game has to offer. It is worth it - every single bit is all worth it.....promptly followed by buying the soundtrack. And a second playthrough, probably.Of course, i'm not sure if anyone will read this review/recommendation/emotional ramble or not.But...Glory to mankind.			"

												This is the first game ive ever played that i believe deserves a review. NieR: Automata is truly a phenominal masterpiece. the graphics are ominous yet strikingly gorgeous, the open world is vast and diverse, combat is fluid and fully immersive, the changing camera angles brought on nostalga from old arcade games and threw you right back into over the shoulder mode keeping you on your toes, and the characters are deep and complex, with unique and changing dialouge to each character. i was so excited on my first playthrough to find out what happens next that i completely forgot about many sidequests and wanted to discover the mysteries this main plot had to offer. i finished the game in 6 hours straight. i loved every second of it. also with that said, i went back to do everything NieR: Automata has to offer. this is one of those games you will be thinking of long after the ending credits roll. the multiple endings leave much to still yet discover. absolutely 10/10 game.that said, the controls took a minute to get used to and the toutorial was on a racetrack to finishing itself. i would have wished to see it slowed down a little bit. but that was something rectified with a couple chances to reread the help screens. seriously Devs, fantastic job.

But let's do some (short) research ""why"" first.So:Game isn't that bad optimized as they say and maybe graphic isn't top tier, but scenery is so beatiful that it compromise lack of technology.Story, och the story! Can't say much without spoilers, but it's one of bests in the games.... Well, I'm kinda exaggerating, but the way it's told makes it too good to let you leave your seat. It's my personal 10/10.In gameplay way only thing i didn't like were subquests. They're kinda nice, but mostly require travel a lot and even if you're going to use fast travel - they'll bore the **** out of you. Rest - fighting, main quests, npc's dialogues, upgrading weapons, dying of eating fish - it all makes the perfect game.How do I rate Nier? I'd say its 9 or 10 out of 10, but anyway - just what the hell are you still doing here? Go buy your god damn copy already!PS: Yeah, you can die (and get ending) by eating fish.			"

												This game is amazing, I love every bit of it!It runs great on my GTX 970 / i5 4690 even on high settings.The only issue I encountered so far is the fullscreen option at 1080p, the game becomes too blurry and weird.Still, you can easily fix it by using a small app called Bordeless Gaming. I'm pretty sure anyway a patch will come out soon to resolve this problem, but for now this is a good substitude.			"

												This game is shaping up to be an easy Top 5 of 2017 for me.  I like the game play, art style, music, voice work, it feels solid.  The world so far is very well done.  As I'm not that far in yet I can't comment on everything, but I feel like this is a game that I will spend 70+ hours in, if not more. + I have not had any random crashing, or issues with graphic glitches.+ I do feel that within the next couple of months this game will get proper patches for PC, and performance will go up+ I can see why some reviewers are upset, but I also feel like patience needs to be had.+ Keyboard and Mouse feels clunky, I easily solved this by plugging in my Xbox 360 controller.As of right now, while I personally enjoy the game, I wouldn't recommend picking it up until proper patches are in place to fix issues that people are having.  That said, I still am giving this a positive review, because I have not had any issues, and the game for me is a positive so far.			"

												NieR: Automata is one of those experiences i won't forget.It's enchanting OST, incredibly beautiful visuals, intriguing storyline and most importantly fantastic gameplay leads to a game that you just keep coming back to.My expectations for this game were high and it still managed to greatly surprise with its quality and also makes me want to try the previous games from the series, as it is my first one.What really brought me to this game was it's similarity with Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance since it was developed by the same company and i definitely wasn't left dissapointed, it was absolutely worth paying the full price, many other developers should watch and learn how to make a great fully priced titles.My only complaints would be about the game's optimalization in some places, and the developer's response to them, NieR: Automata has been out for a week and currently there is still no patch that would adress the most prominent issues with their product (although it was announced that they are aware of the game's problems and are working on fixing them).Also i feel like the game could have a bit better side quests and activities, since they can get repetetive after while, but i still might be a bit spoiled from The Witcher 3 so excuse me if i'm being picky.I would also like to give huge Thank You to some of the community members that worked on their own patches in order to fix the fullscreen bug and improve the game's performance, you guys are Gods among men.I hope that Yoko Taro-Senpai will team up with Platinum Games once more in the future to make another great product as it is match made in heaven.My final score for the game is a strong 9/10.

												Excellent game, but terrible PC optimization.I'll start with this issue: the optimization is awful. It had me drop the game's resolution to 1600x1200 while my screen can support 1980x1080, and even this sacrifice couldn't make me play at more than 30FPS (mostly 25 in open world) with medium settings. It's been very hard to adapt to such low FPS. Furthermore, the keyboard controls (yes, I forgot my controller at home before leaving but couldn't wait to get it back to start playing this game) include some issues such as the dodging system, which requires you to double tap a direction key (WASD) instead of taping one key while moving. Navigating between usable items without opening the main menu is pretty tough as well, so what I did basically was binding the keys to my mouse and it works just fine.Enough of these system issues, let's now talk about the game. It is a true masterpiece. The main scenario is great, even though it is a little bit too short, but it doesn't really matter because the game is based on replaying the story several times to get every single spark of awesomeness this game can bring. The sidequests are even more excellent, the feeling of saving a fellow android or seeing machines think about what they can bring to the world they live in is a great experience and made me think about our own life as humans.In addition to a incredible scenario, what I HAVE to talk about is the OST. IT. IS. AMAZING! I seldom heared anything that good in a videogame to be honest. Chills, tears, happiness, fear, motivation, these are 5 of the countless feelings the different soundtracks brought me while playing. They contribute widely to an absolutely immersing environment.I could give more and more good points, but I have to make it a bit shorter (eh), so I'll just write down the only thing that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off: I really didn't enjoy being forced to playing 9S while doing some VERY important sidequests or roaming to find hidden chests. I think every character should've acquired the ability of hacking after completing routes A, B and C/D. Don't get me wrong, I like the character and the way it evolves through the entire story, but damn I would just like to play the other characters! But they keep forcing me into playing him because he's the only one who can hack things.Anyway, I HIGHLY recommend this game for anyone who likes RPG's. Though I think the PC version is not optimized at all, I think a better PC setup would actually make it run way more smoothely than my PC does. Still, running it in HQ would require a very powerful setup in my opinion.Have fun playing NieR: Automata!			"

												This is one of the best games ever made and i'm gonna tell you why . From a storytelling aspect just simply goes far as the human can go into philosophy themes even their characters like pascal or hegel just tell you how much heart this game has . It jump on the train of human existence question and takes the answer even further . From a soundtrack direction it simply has the finest songs from the last 10 years: Beautiful , sad , emotional that breaks your heart in to pieces. From a gameplay point of view is complete and fill with deep mechanics and 2d/4 wall breaking levels. It's just a complete package traying to reach perfection . Nier automata will be remember in the history of mankind as Art in the very best definition. I can't keep writing because there is too much talk i don't want to spoil this ride.

												2B's backstory is very well-rounded, just the right size - quite hefty but with little excess. It appears firm on the outside, but like 2B herself, it is actually soft and perhaps has a bit of jiggle. Her backstory isn't something you can understand by just reading text, you have to grasp and feel it. 2B's butt is also really nice.Oh right, the game is pretty fun with a lot of action and the story is quite melancholy but leaves you with some modicum of hope.

												The PC version of NieR: Automata is an OK-ish ""port"". It certainly has its flaws but is by far not the worst.Let me show you how I run the game:GPU: R9 280CPU: FX 6300 (6 x 3.79 GHz)RAM: 8 GBOS: Win10 64-BitMy game settings are:Anti-Aliasing: x8---> offTexture filter: x16---> x8Blur---> onShadows: high/medium/low---> lowEffects: high/low---> highAmbient Occlusion---> offWith my system and these settings I can run the game on 1080p at 50-60 fps without any problems. Knowing that my system can run The Witcher 3 at high settings, yet maintaining a steady 60 fps, it's kind of a bummer. I'm pretty sure I could run Automata at max settings at a smooth 60 fps as well, if it was better optimized.Port problems:  fullscreen mode is buggy for quite a few people, myself included. The game internally renders the game to 900p and scales it up to whatever resolution you picked. A workaround is to use Borderless Window.  white screen/black screen for some people  if your CPU has an integrated GPU, make sure the game uses your dedicated GPU because it might use the former by default  game freezes for some peopleThe game itself is simply amazing, that's all I can say.

												Really fast and engaging combat reminiscent of Bayonetta or Metal Gear Rising (Automata has the same director as MGR so no surprise there). It also incorporates some bullet hell mechanics like those that were in the original NieR, which really helps spice things up. It's some of the best combat in any RPG I've played. You don't need to play NieR to understand what's going on, but if you're familiar with the events and characters you will probably get a lot more out of the story (this also extends to Drakengard 1 and 3, but to a much lesser extent). I've played a lot of action games over the years, and NieR Automata is shaping up 2B one of my favorites.			"

												I've not put a whole lot of time into this as of writing this, but what I HAVE played, I've enjoyed immensely. This game runs fine with occasional dropping of frames with my GTX 770. This game is very difficult AND unforgiving when it comes to saving. I attempted to beat the prolougue on hard and was defeated several times causing me to have to start from the beginning. When the game says that it doesn't autosave, you should also know that there are only specific areas within the game that you can save. And you should save. Often. The difference between normal and hard is the difference between taking 10 hits and 3 before dying. The gameplay is very fun. You can chain together combos, shoot bullets at giant bosses, and blow yourself up. Repeatedly. This is just a very bare bones review for now, but I will expand on it as I get more into the game.Oh.

Until then, I'd recommend waiting until they patch the game.  But, other then that.  The game is fun, you can fix the full screen issue by downloading 3rd-party software (Borderless Gaming), but despite all these issues.  I enjoy it.  But, sadly, there is a lot of problems as well.Sure, yadda yadda, this and that, blah blah blah, denuvo this.  I am happy that this game got a PC port, at least a playable one in my experience, for others, it is quite different.  To be honest, I wouldn't recommend getting this game in it's current state, I got it because I loved the first one, NieR: Gestalt, and purchased this game when it appeared on Steam.  Would I recommend it?  Yes and no.  Of course the trolls will be having a field day in the discussions, people looking to play this game may be a bit discouraged to play this.

												I've been looking for ""the game"" for a long time now- something that sucks me in and makes me really want to keep playing  longer than an hour or so.  I thought I'd never find it, but I took a gamble on this one, and it is utterly transcendant.  It takes me back to the days where I could sit and marathon a game for days- looking for secrets, tweaking my stats, spamming the jump button, and smashing up bad guys.I'm entirely sold- worth every penny.  If you're looking for a game to help you remember what it was like to love gaming- one that gives you the chills you got the first time you saw a Colossus, that gives you flashbacks to the climactic combat of Chaos Legion, and has enough sparkles, whosits, and explosions to knock your socks off (even in 1600:900), this is it.RE: HardwareNo issues at 1900:600 on an AMD FX8320  @3.5GHz + 16GB DDR3 + Sapphire RX480 OC 8GB.  Haven't even tried a higher resolution yet because there's already so much stuff to look at my eyes are basically bleeding.  Do kids these days have supervision or something???  Honestly, my brain is having trouble not getting distracted by the sweeping landscapes as it is- I think I'd probably stroke out at 4k + 60Hz or whatever the new hotness is.Don't even get me started on the soundtrack- suffice it to say that it's tear-jerkingly beautiful and heart-stirringly epic.Plus, the whole thing just oozes a ""cool sexy-carbon-fiber vs post-apocalyptic machinepunk"" aesthetic.

												While there seem to be many people getting poor performance, stuttering, crashes and various resolution/display bugs I can't say I've had any issues in the 30 minutes I've played using 6700K/1070/16GB RAM/SSD.Max settings (but no AA). Playing at 2560x1440 (downsampled to a 1080p display, because I figured I'd rather have actual resolution than AA do the smoothing).Resolution/fullscreen settings are definitely working as 1600x900 looks very bad compared to 1920x1080, and 2560x1440 looks cleaner than 1920x1080 (though the UI seems in the menus seems to look identical no matter what resolution the game is set at). This tells me that people having issues with resolution setting/fullscreen mode are being hit with a bug of some kind (rather than those features simply not being implemented out of developer oversight or something).Not a single dip so far. A perfect 60, other than the cutscenes which run at 30. And I haven't seen any of the cutscene stuttering that some people have been experiencing.The long and short of it is whilst many certainly seem to be having issues with the game, others don't. So it's an iffy, tempermental port that may or may not play well with your machine, but it's not a hopelessly poorly optimised one that is doomed to run terribly either.If you're on the fence I suggest buying and trying.

												Smooth sailing!45 hours. No bugs. No CTD, no issues, smooth and clean gameplay. Easy to tab in and out and even play in window mode.Every game should be released like this.-Good graphics but not excellent.-Nice music.-Story starts off a bit...odd. But hang in there and it gets really good.-Nice flow in combat - But play with a controller!-Some quests are a bit tedious. Not really surprising though, it's an A-RPG (kind off). There are always a few of those lame quests.The only real issue I had was the huuuuuuge flaw in design in the tutorial, where if you died you had to watch and play the whole dang thing over from the start. >.<If more games had this standard in releases it could actually be fun buying new products again instead of waiting 2-6 months for patches.

												After finishing all the major endings, these are my final thoughts on the game.Pros:+ Great story and characters	+ Despite some cliche moments and characters its one of the best story lines in an RPG I've played + World Design	+ Every zone has its own charm, and it all wraps together nicely to give off a post apocalyptic/battle torn feel well. 	+ Perfect for exploring, some stunning scenery from places around the world+ Music and sound	+ The music in this game is incredible, the best soundtrack I've heard in a game. The sound design for everything else is top notch + Combat	+ While basic on the surface, it does have enough depth to make it fun to use while still leaving room for crazy combos	+ Weapons work together in a way that lets the player tailor their combat style to the situation at hand	+ Explore to find more weapons to suit your play style Not Pros but Not Cons:+- Hacking	+- If you're like me, you will probably get sick of the hacking...Its just too good of a ""weapon"" with not much variation. My solution was to kick it down to easy and let the game play the sequences instead of hating myself for the rest of the game. Then turning it back up when you get to do some actual combat. Cons:- Performance	- Fps Drops, low FPS cut scenes...While most of the game it performed fine, a few boss fights really had my fps chugging and the cut scenes are totally noticeable.	- Full screen bug, fixed with FAR (on the steam forums) but still annoyingAll in all, it was a fantastic game. Its too bad you don't lose your memory of the game along with your save at the final decision...I would love to experience the game over again for the first time.9.5/10 - 0.5 off for performanceSpecs:Intel i5 3550 3.3ghzNvidia GTX 960 2gb16Gigs 1600Mhz ramSamsung SSD			"

												----------------------------Nier Automata at a glance:----------------------------Pros:- Compelling narrative with great characters, lore, and thought-provoking concepts.- Great aesthetic and art direction.- Great combat. This game is extremely narrative-driven and as such it favors a much more accessible combat system so while it is not as sophisticated as many would like it is still extremely fun and satisfying as we've come to expect from Platinum.- Phenominal soundtrack. The composer from the original Nier returns to deliver an incredibly powerful soundtrack that truly sets the atmosphere and helps brings the story to life.- As expected from a Yoko Taro game, Nier Automata incorporates some unconventional story-telling and gameplay design but unlike his previous titles these elements are extremely well-implemented this time around making for a very rich gameplay experience that remains faithful to the original Nier while still adding a few extra surprises.Cons:- PC port is locked at 60 FPS.- PC port is poorly optimized, if you try to push for 4k resolution you will run into some trouble maintaining a smooth 60 FPS. There is also a bug that causes 1080p fullscreen mode to play at an upscaled 900p. A 3rd party solution like Borderless Gaming will be needed to circumvent this issue. While there are mods/fixes that rectify most of these issues, it is still an extra step that should not be necessary in the first place.- Cuscenes are 30 FPS locked and seem to dip even lower at times making for some choppy cutscenes which are extremely jarring.- While the aesthetic and great art style more than make up for it, graphics are not this game's strong point and graphics settings are also extremely limited on the PC port. That said, you can still get it to look better than PS4 on a mid to high-end machine and the game looks great at 4k resolution.- The game will stutter at times while traversing the world, not game-breaking by any means but definitely noticeable. Apparently this is also present in the PS4 version of the game.If you've played or are at least familiar with the events of the original Nier then you will be greatly rewarded with many references and juicy lore as well as smaller references/parallels to the Drakengard series. However it's not necessary to have played the original to understand the story in this game as it is very much its own world. This is a masterfully crafted game and easily one of the best games I've ever played.			"

												Overall, a pretty good game, though you'll need a higher-end computer to play it without issues. NieR Automata is a sequel to the previous NieR game (though playing the prequel is not required) which is itself a spinoff of the fifth ending of the game Drakengard, which, again, is not required. NieR: Automata does a good job of introducing the characters and setting in a way that doesn't feel like a huge infodump.In terms of gameplay, it feels reminiscent of Dark Souls, in that if you die, instead of dropping all your Souls, you drop any plug-in chips you had equipped (the equivalent of skills, there is huge room for customization, particularly because you only have limited space, and more advanced chips take up more space) and a small amount of experience. If you make it back to your body without dying, you can reclaim the items you dropped (but not if you die en route). If you really want a challenge, the hardest difficulty (difficulty can be changed mid-game) causes you to die in one hit (the evade button is your friend). However, even on Easy, you can't get complacent, because there are enemies that can still oneshot you. Easy difficulty also has a number of ""auto-battle"" chips that you can equip, that do things like auto-shoot, auto-dodge, auto-melee that can be equipped at your leisure (and can only be equipped on Easy).The default keyboard/mouse controls are a little wonky if you don't rebind them (like \ and / being your melee attack binds, and left/right shift being your ranged attack binds), but there is the option to do so.There are also a ton of fun easter eggs, like a Steam Achievement for looking up 2B's skirt 10 times, or how if you self-destruct in the space station you blow it up and the game ends. Pros:-Fantastic combat system that feels fluid and responsive.-Great story-Voice acting is pretty good-Soundtrack is baller-You'll only get loading screens if you fast travel or die.Cons:-Highish minimum specs required to play the game above low graphics.-Fullscreen bug (alt-tabbing changes it to windowed mode)-The cutscenes are pre-rendered and can have framerate dips.-Much like Dark Souls, you'll have a better time playing this on a controller than with a Keyboard/Mouse. Unlike Dark Souls, it's very much playable with Keyboard/Mouse controls though.			"

Nier: Automata is a unique game. There are many reason for that, yet talking about some of them could potentially spoil the experience. Just know that under all its nonsense about machines, aliens, humans on the moon and stylish Gothic Lolita androids, there is a fascinating and emotional tale about what it means to be (heh) human - in all its beauty and ugliness.Playing the previous games of the series isn't really necessary, since Automata rarely references the past games - with most times being more like nice little Easter eggs to long time fans than indispensable plot elements. That being said, this is my fist Yoko Taro game, and playing Automata certainly made me consider playing the original Nier and the Drakengard series. The combat mechanics are good. They are not as complex as other Hack and Slash games like Bayonetta or Devil May Cry, but are still pretty fun to mess with, especially considering there are many unique weapons, each with their own visuals and movesets. A Chip upgrade system that allows you to customize your attributes and abillities also leaves a lot of room for experimentation. This is important, considering Nier's unique type of storytelling, which makes you replay the game a few times before you can see the real ending. Since progress is carried between playthrough, you can expect to continue to improve your character's equipment and face increasingly challenging enemies.When it comes to the game replayability, It's not an understatement to say you haven't experienced most of what Nier: Automata has to offer until you've seen it's 3 first endings. Thankfully, each subsequent playthrough of the game dramatically changes its story and mechanics to the point you might think you are playing a completely different game.Oh, yeah. I almost forgot... The game's soundtrack is AMAZING. And I'm really not exaggerating when I say this is one of the best game sountracks ever made.Okay, now to the bad parts:Nier: Automta is far from perfect. The aforementioned necessity to replay the game may be an issue to some, especially for those that would like to experience it all in one go. Environments also end up being reused a bit much, since you end up visiting the same locations that, while beautiful, certainly begin to lose some of their charm after the 3rd time you visited them. Weren't big deals for me, but I imagine may bother some.What truly bothered me while playing automata were the boring side-quests, that, although usually have some sort of emotional plot twist that help to flash out the game world, are nothing more than plain fetch-quests. Thankfully, they are optional and only needed to complete one time, since progress is carried between playthroughs.Another thing was the grindy nature of the game when it comes to upgrading your equipment. The game is not that hard that you need to have everything maxed so you can progress in the story (and you'll probably end up way over-leveling your enemies if you decide to farm materials) but it's still frustrating to have to farm a certain enemy in a certain place for several hours so you can do the most basic upgrades. Also, despite the main characters and enemies being very detailed, the environments, while certainly beautiful, suffers from some low quality textures if you decide to look more closely, Finally, the PC port is less than ideal, with resolution issues (that can fixed by playing on widowed mode) and, apparently, performance issues and crashes on some systems. Issues I did NOT experience (with the exception of a few rare and isolated crashes) while playing at 1080p on a 970, with a i7-4790k and 16Gb of RAM. However, I did have to completely disable AA to get a stable 60fps. Every other graphic option was turned to the max (which leads me to believe that AA is, in some way, breaking the game).So, Should you play Nier: Automata?Yep, and do it at least 3 times! And then realize Yoko Taro is not even close to being through with you, and that there are still buckets of tears to be shed...			"

												This is the game of the year.Make sure you continue the game after the first end because the story continues after the 2nd end.I strongly suggest to leave the game on normal unless you a very good player on dark souls. The normal difficulty is a real normal difficulty.Pros :- Great Story- Semi-open world. Just big enough - not like ubisoft.- No generic quest.- Great diversity in gameplay ( spectacle fighter, shoot'em up, twin stick , side scroller)Cons :- Need controller.- Lacks a difficulty level between Normal and Hard. Hard is almost the same as very hard since most hit will one shot you anyway unless you have high defense.			"

												Worth all the money.Definitely one of the best games i have played yet, if not the best.I only have one complaint and thats the amount of frames you drop in most cutscenes, you sometimes hit the 20-30 fps when viewing them. However this is not a problem for me personally. I don't really notice it that much, I do notice it though, but then again it's not that much. If you think it would be a problem for you, then the frame drops, in the cutscenes, could probably ruin the cutscene a bit for you. Though the story of the game is definitely a good enough reason to buy the game. It's just a masterpiece.Story 10/10.Gameplay 10/10Cutscene 8.9/10Personal enjoyment 10/10Final score 9.725/10			"

												NieR: Automata is incredible at being a video game. Yoko Taro, the director, has combined his mad genius with the elegant combat stylings of Platinum to create an experience that truly explores what it means to be human.Notably, humans aren't even around.Instead, NieR first appears to be a game of dichotomies. There are segments of high action, segments of low action. You play adaptive androids, you fight mindless machines. An army of good, an army of evil. The duty of loyalty, the risk of curiosity. It is by ruthlessly breaking these concepts that Yoko Taro and his team manage to make you feel genuine emotion for these constructs. I dare not spoil any of this adventure, so suffice it to say that even what appears to be a silly fetch quest will surprise you or make you reexamine how you looked at a character.That is not to say that it doesn't have silly fetch quests, however. While any medium uses highs and lows to accent its points, jumping the difficulty every story mission means you are practically forced to wander the game's open world to be strong enough to progress. As meaningful as the game's content is, a quest to kill four giant robots is still just a quest to kill four giant robots, no matter the discussions and ramifications that come from it. This game is not a spectacle fighter or arena brawler -- my one word of caution before purchasing is to ask yourself whether you can handle either playing Easy mode or exploring the world maybe a bit more than you'd like before progressing to the next story segment.And that's everything off-putting I have to say about this game -- this beautiful experience. The use of music, voice, color, cinematography, queer ladies, and twinstick shooting segments coalesce into what can only be described as utterly magnificent.I have never played a game that so thoroughly made me think beyond ""are these actions correct?"" We have plenty of games that profess grey morality and make you choose aribitrary solutions. Again, NieR breaks the ""do bad"" and ""do good"" dichotomy. 2B, our mechanical heroine, must make her own choices and assumptions just like the player. Sometimes you will be struck by the childishness of a crying robot in overalls. Other times, by the frankness of an antagonist who freely speaks their plans. Or, perhaps, you will simply be struck by the buzzsaw arm of a sentient oil rig.NieR: Automata is a masterpiece.			"

												So, I decided to wait until I had completed every bit of this game to write this review and I should say: It was all worth it. This game is easily one of the best game I have ever played and enters the category of MUST HAVE- Soundtrack:The music in this game is AMAZING, one of its strongest points. It works so well with the story and bosses fights that makes you have goosebumps from how epic this makes you feel. Also  exploration have some nice and peaceful musics that keeps you really immersed. - Story:I wish some characters had more development on their personality. But overall, it is very nice and on some points really makes you think about life and existence. It has 5 main endings, 26 on total. All of them based on the choices you make during the game.- Gameplay:There's a variety gameplay elements and the combat is very responsive and fun. Also you have a lot of options to build with the plug-ins, weapons and pods you can find.- Difficulty:I like how difficulty works in this game. Yeah, theres some weird difficulty spike between normal and hard, but if you have never played this game before, you should play on normal until you are familiar with the controls, then you can change to hard. On hard you can be one shotted if you aren't careful, but it's cool that you have some sense of danger instead of just face rolling through everything on normal. Very hard are for hardcore people and pretty much anything can one shoot you, so you have that option too if you feel like it.- Graphics:It's alright, it fits the theme of the game.- PC Port:Until this day, the port still have problems with fullscreen resolutions and performance, but it can be somewhat fixed by some 3rd party mods and it's totally playable. Hopefully improve their next ports in the future.			"

												My Experince so far.. its bootyful ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)its a blast to play! Its totaly worth the 79$C. The combat systeme is great and refined. Altough i find this game difficult to play with a keybord so a controller is reccomended. This game is a consol port so it will / dose have some bugs and things that you may not like. Such as locked 60FPS and issues with resolution scaling. Yet it is well optimised as far as fram rate. With a fast mod install i was able to fix the resoultion scaling so i can play this at 1440p and up. As far as story it is great! There is allot of lore to read about it. You dont have to play the other Nier games to enjoy this one at all. Yet i feel like im oblicated to play the other ones due to this sotry being soo great. After all the bugs are fixed and the devs maybe give us more options to change video settings aswell as a bechmark and so on. This game will be almost 10/10. Pros -Exellent combat macanics -Great visuals (once you fix the scaling bug) -One of the best storys/ lore -great detail in map Cons-Some Bugs (still vary new game so bugs shold be fixed vary soon.. hopefuly) -Not allot of options to change video settings TLDRI know this game will enevtually top the steam reviews and become overwhelming positive. Great story, fighting vary fun, Great detail.. This game is vary nicely rounded ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 9/10 (fix bugs and its a 10)			"

												What this game taught me after the first play through :- For the love of God, play this with Japanese dub and English sub. Gives total immersion, and nothing seems to be lost in translation.- The best music I've ever heard in a video game.- 3D version of Tohou mixed with Gundam, Final Fantasy, and Legend of Dragoon.- Androids can run and fight in high heels, but they'll stumble over a rock.- Does this b!tch ever open boxes with her hands?- Adam & Eve were created by a horny robot orgy. - Heard the Japanese version of CRAAAAABBB PEOPLE (I guess it should be called "" 'このままじゃダメ' said occasionally in epic fight song""). My life is now complete. - Opera is now cool af.- Androids can't swim.- Fighting Super Saiyan Sepharoth in an Advent Children scene without auto-aim was okay I guess.- Androids need to breathe.- Androids have tear ducts.I'm really glad that while the devs went straight for the cliche sex appeal, it was actually a pretty negligible factor when compared to the game's actual strengths.

												Confession: I'm honestly just going to gush about the game. If you're looking for a more in-depth, critical review, I'm afraid I can't help. If you're looking to read the ramblings of someone who just finished the game, then welcome.You might think that this is a game about androids destroying robots in the distant future.Well, you'd be right, actually. But it becomes so much more than that, to the point I don't even have words to describe it. If there was ever a game I'd say is a 'must buy', it just got knocked off the shelf and replaced by NieR:Automata, possibly for all time.Now, a heads-up: this is kinda a poor port, and i struggled with driver crashes and resolution issues (the latter I didn't entirely care about, however). That being said, I'm normally picky about that sort of thing, yet I pulled through and didn't let it hamper my enjoyment of the game much at all.I played through the entire game on Hard, and would heartily reccomend it. Granted, yes, the prologue can be fairly difficult, and you are unable to save until you've completed it, but I would nonetheless reccomend it - sharpening your combat skills that early on will go a long way, believe me. Of course, you can change the difficulty at any time, and there are NO achievements for beating the game on a certain difficulty. As I said, I reccomend Hard, but that's for a combination of Story and gameplay. If you just want to experience the story (and props to you if you do, it's amazing!), Normal is more than enough.The story is...admittedly convoluted and philosophical as hell, but that's what makes it so...beautiful.What does it mean to be human? To be an android? To be a machine?To be alive?To be?What does ANYTHING mean?Is it a simple difference of parts and logic circuits, or something more?The way NieR:Automata tells its story is unlike anything I've ever seen, and the endings (there's 26 of them!) are each  magnificent (and sometimes hilarious), ESPECIALLY the true ending. You owe it to yourself to leap in as blind as possible, and experience all that the game has to offer. It is worth it - every single bit is all worth it.....promptly followed by buying the soundtrack. And a second playthrough, probably.Of course, i'm not sure if anyone will read this review/recommendation/emotional ramble or not.But...Glory to mankind.			"

												I rarely finish games. I play 10-20 hours of them, then get distracted by something else and move on. In my 15+ years of playing games, I can count the number of games that I've finished on two hands. After 60 hours of playing, I just finished all major endings of NieR: Automata. This game, far moreso than any long RPG I've ever touched, does everything it can to remain engaging throughout. I was still being surprised and delighted up to the very end -- and I mean the VERY end. It flirts with your expectations of what will and even CAN happen, and it does so with a confidence rarely seen in the RPG world.Without spewing out lines and lines of expository dialogue at every turn, it makes you care about characters, shows them change, breaks your heart, and manages to showcase an uncommonly nihilistic perspective while still, somehow, feeling uplifting.Oh, and despite all its experimentation, it sits on a foundation of incredibly polished and satisfying gameplay. Really, I can think of few negatives. Its less-than-AAA budget is clear, leading to some kind of empty environments and a lot of invisible walls. Also, the unnecessarily sexualized outfits of the main female characters wasn't great, but the sexualization begins and ends with the outfits, which is refreshing--the characters, animations, and most importantly, the camera never objectify the characters. So, unlike most cases, it really is a minor complaint.NieR: Automata has easily made it into the list of the most memorable and influencial video game experiences of my life. But because of its nature, it's really difficult to say any more without spoiling the experience. All I'll say is that the way it uses the medium of video games to tell its story is wholely unique and unforgettable.			"

												This is my first experience within Yoko Taro's creative mind and I am in love with it.The themes are strong (even though most of them only truly appear in the last third of the story, after A and B endings). I'm pretty sure I will think about some of the questions asked for the years to come. The story left me with a bittersweet taste, which is pretty appropriate within the context.The gameplay is decently fun, don't expect DMC or Bayonetta level of mechanics but you should find enough customization within the system (through weapons, pods and chips choices), enough stylish animations and variety in the gameplay to find something that suits you. It should be noted that about half of the side quests are either pretty boring or just plain bad (lots of goings of comings), don't power through it if you don't want to, you can 100% the game after the final ending thanks to a mode unlock.The art direction is breathtaking. NieR is not the best looking game of this generation - far from it - but it fights its technical weakness with a deep dive in an apocalyptic dreamland. I find myself teared apart between the feeling of loneliness/desolation and the awe of this weird beautiful and fully living world that seems so familiar yet so alien.Last but not least the OST... let's just say it's hands down the best game soundtrack I have ever listened. Poetic, tragic, sometimes really catchy, it finds itself perfectly in sync with what happens on the screen.I never was a fan of JRPG, beat'em all or shoot'em up, yet this game found the perfect balance for me. With its unique perspective on the game as a media, NieR:Automata conquered my heart.THIS CANNOT CONTINUE.			"

So overall I would definately recommend this game to anyone who are intrested, In my opinion it will be a great buy and it will certainly help Yoko Taro to bring us more amazing and unique games like this one.

												For me, this game is wonderful, gorgeous in every possible aspect.I love graphics of Nier:Automata - it's stunningly beautiful. I love soundtrack of the game - it's just so freaking amazing. I love combat mechanics - it's so sweet, crisp and dynamic. And finally, I love story and characters of the game... thanks, Yoko Taro (there are probably other writers who worked on story besides him - I am just not so sure - and for their work I am grateful as well). Yoko Taro says his writings are crap, but If that's so, then I just can not choose words to describe shortly and briefly the quality of the plots of most of today's games without using an abusive language.I am thankful to all of creators and to all of those who contributed to creation of this beautiful piece of art, masterpiece, in my opinion. Games like Nier:Automata and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt are really bringing me hope for the greater future of video games.So you should most likely just go and buy the game already.P. S. Though, of course, as many others, I would really like to see more story content about past and future (especially future) of 9S, 2B and A2 (well, maybe we already have enough information about A2's past). Square Enix?..P. P. S. Sorry for any grammar mistakes in the text. English is not my native language.			"

												Nier: Automata is an excellent and yet very strange slash'em'up + shoot'em'up hybrid.Pros:Superb soundtrackGreat animationsCombat has a nice, quick pace and changes in perspective and style on the fly works really well for most part. Hard mode seemed the best, since Normal is quite easy. Very Hard is... painful. Well, except in the first mission. Choosing Hard on first mission is actually quite hard. Like old-school hard with almost anything killing you with one hit and being thrown all the way back to the beginning of a long sequence. Just be prepared for some pain if you decide to try it like that.Certain dramatic sequences are pretty intense.Voice acting is actually pretty good (both english and japanese).Cons:Level system. It really hurts this game, since levels actually heavily affect the damage you can deal on enemies. Game would be better off without it and being balanced towards the chips and weapon upgrades the player has instead. For example, if you want to try to fight against the secret boss, don't bother being too much below level 99. At level 66 I was doing literally no damage to it, despite being able to stay alive for quite a while against its attacks otherwise. Needless to say that instead of going to a grinding spree to level up I just went and watched the sequences from Youtube in order not to waste few more hours. This felt even more absurd considering the game makes fun of gaming media trends and archetypical behavior in them in its quests and dialogue (killing, grinding, etc).Combat system feels bit superfluous, because you can go through the game without using it much. Even on highest difficulty, which is all about just avoiding hits to avoid instant death. For example, there are tons of cool juggles that you could do... But there is little reason to use them.Some of the dialogue is... odd. I never found out why 9S and B2 seem to take turns in being paranoid towards machines and supporting communication with them. On the plus side there are neat references to older Nier game if you are familiar with it.Spotty texturing work in some places. Also, currently there is no adjustments for lighting system quality, which occasionally can bring the game to its knees. There is a mod that can reduce the lighting complexity without much loss of quality that seems to radically increase framerates.			"

												tl;dr Nice to play once, should have waited for a sale.Story: Easy to follow, if you didn't play any previous games, like I did, though you get the feeling, that you missed one or two jokes and it hooks you for more (sorry, guys. didn't bite :) )Bugs, etc.: For PC turn down graphics and/or prepare for bugs. Or google ""nier automata white screen"" to see common solutions. I didn't install a mod, just set my graphics to specific settings and it became entirely playable. Graphics still look nice.Controls: People recommended gamepad, so I used one, works good. Didn't try mouse/keyboard.Gameplay: heavy on bullethell elements, though you don't need to move through there in frame perfect precision. Most of the bullets are destroyable or you can dodge through. Combat is pretty fun, certain upgrades make your meleeattacks create shockwaves and you dance around on the battlefield. ♥♥♥♥ ton of pantyshots. Basically unavoidable.Japanese elements: emotionless robotgirl, young male anime character, mini-mechas, certain story elements, this game is full of this. Seems to be a downer for some people, so I wanted to point that one out, too.Hacking in hollywood style: personal pet peeves, but executed in a fun way.			"

												I didn't expect too much, coming into this game. Just some nice graphics and our allaround-waifu 2B, mixed with a weak story. Well, safe to say i was quite wrong about that. The way the story slowly unwraps is actually done very well and took me on a feeltrip, i definitely didn't expect.  especially with the ""true"" ending. (And a big thank you for whoever helped me reach it!)  Though you may need a somewhat strong computer to run it properly even at relatively low settings and it did crash around  three times in my ~40hours of playtime.Despite that, the game is still good. It has a great soundtrack and the characters were really likeable.  (especially 9s)  The story is good, the visuals are nice and there's a lot of content. All in all, i'd give this game a (8-8.5/10)  and i do recommend it if you have the time and money to spare(Everything stated above is my personal opinion and experience It may not apply to everyone.

												Yoko Taro, Keichi Okabe, Platinum Games, and all those involved in the development of this game have created something very special. After completing all the major story endings and secret boss battles, it is only appropriate to write out my thoughts on this game. In short, it is a masterful experience.From beginning to multiple ends, I was completely invested in the story of 2B, 9S and all those that appeared throughout the game's long, epic story. I loved how the first couple playthroughs were just a warm up for the darkness that was to come. The shifts in game play for traditional third person action to sidescrolling beat em up to top down bullet hell is so dang smooth and fun, I just could not get enough of it! Of course, there is the superb soundtrack that trumps even the first games Nier (heh) perfect soundtrack. I already purchased the soundtrack the minute it became available and have been listeing to it since.Those of you that have been on the fence on this game should discard all hesitation if you like at least half of the following things:1. Engaging and emotional storyline.2. Fast, smooth combat.3. Sublime soundtrack that will tug at your heartstrings.4. Interesting and tragic characters.5. Unique shifts in game play that can happen out of the blue.This game rewards those that have finished the first Nier since there are A LOT of references to the previous Nier game that will make you laugh, sad, and possibly happy, despite all the tragedy. That does not mean you need to have played the previous Nier to really enjoy this game, it is just a better experience for you if you have. I cannot recommend this game enough for those looking for a unique experience that exhibits a truly wonderful story that will be remembered for years to come. If there is ever another Nier game, I will instantly buy it!			"

Quick overview:_____________________________________________ Originally posted by Port Pod 29: 
Proposal: Fix following issues.

1. Some people are experiencing various issues with fullscreen mode, such as:
 Lower internal resolution / graphics being upscaled Worse performance2. There's an issue with effects such as godrays, where they are rendered at a lower resolution (possibly 900p), no matter what resolution you play the game at.

3. The game uses many samples for Global Illumination (on all settings, from high to low), which can result in poor performance.

To sum it up, the port is definitely not so broken that it can't be played, it's just disappointing that such a great game has technical issues. I will include a section at the end with resources to help improve your experience playing through the game.Well, how is the game itself?   The gameplay is great. 
The music is great.   The story is great. 
The concepts and themes    explored are great. 
The endings  are great. Is great.            Is great. 
Is great.         Is great.

              Is great.
                                  great.  _____________________________________________STORY:Quick note, do not watch the cinematic that plays in the menu before creating a new game.It spoils scenes from the story, just like the original Nier's intro did.I want to talk about this part of the game without spoiling anything, so please bear with me. It's going to be a little hard to convey.This game manages to take what the original game did and bring an interesting twist to the story and themes. Generally it feels very different and fresh.It's almost like taking the plunge from Drakengard to Nier 1, but it still manages to stay true to what people fell in love with in Nier 1.You have to play the game through  all the way to ending E to get the full experience.And no, playing through to ending E doesn't mean that you have to play through the same game four times. Ending B is the closest thing to replaying the game and even then you get a very different perspective along with very different gameplay. Everything beyond that is completely original content and gameplay. This was an aspect of Nier 1 that was blown out of proportions too by word of mouth.If you don't mind stories that are very weird and out there, and you have the patience to sit down and understand this game's story, then it's definitely one of the best and most interesting things you can experience in terms of games.Yoko Taro is a god.If you want to get caught up on Nier lore I recommend  Clemps' analysis videos  , he has some great ones on both Nier and Drakengard.If you want to see Nier 1 in it's entirety, you can check out  TheSw1tcher's playthrough of it. MUSIC / SOUND:All the track, ranging from overworld tunes to small encounters and big boss fights are all beautifully composed. Not only are there some extremely great tracks on this game's OST, but they also have many different variants, which are used extremely well, both to aid the story and gameplay.Keiichi Okabe is a god.I'd also like to mention that there are some very big pros in terms of the sound design in and of itself. Combat sounds satisfying and when characters interrupt each other they ACTUALLY interrupt each other. There's not some awkward pause, like in a lot of other movies and games, it feels much more natural. Also, you can freely choose between both the English and Japanese voices / subtitles, which is a nice touch. While there are a few performances that are a little lacking, the experience as a whole is great. There's a lot of emotion poured into many scenes.GAMEPLAY:This is one of platinum funnest games to play. There's a lot of good things to note here. First of all, the whole pod and plugin system is great. You get pods that have a main fire mode along with a special pod program. The pods are utilized, not only in normal 3D combat, but also in 2D / bullet hell like sections, along with hybrid sections mixing both gameplay types. The pod programs are powerful abilities on cooldown that can alter the combat a lot.On top of that, plugin chips allows you to create your own playstyle and optimize your setup for specific challenges.PlatinumGames are gods.One of the few games I'd consider giving a 10/10 to, but it's hard to rate a game objectively with a numerical value. It has touched me, entertained me, and made me think. I think it accomplished what it set out to do extremely well. _____________________________________________ an example of some of the atmospheric music ᶫᶦᶰᵏI recommend playing the game in windowed mode using  Borderless Gaming ᶫᶦᶰᵏ[github.com]to simulate fullscreen. This was the most stable and smooth way for me to play the game,and basically eleminated all issues I had.If you are still having issues with performance,then you can try  this mod ᶫᶦᶰᵏ to lower the performance hit of Global Illumination.You can use  AutoHotKey ᶫᶦᶰᵏ[autohotkey.com] to hide your mouse cursor while playing.Here's a link to a script that does just that: http://www39.zippyshare.com/v/G7HOa1rt/file.htmlMy own personal ReShade for the game: http://www108.zippyshare.com/v/xhELo8YZ/file.html(first time I've shared a ReShade profile, don't what the best way to do it is!)

												Firstly, I'd recommend it for fans of hack & slash gameplay. However, it has several issues with the PC port. It's got a hard time with widescreen monitors. The resolution scaling is totally off! Setting it to fullscreen actually shrinks the game's screen and distorts the text, as if stretching a lower resolution. I needed a MOD to get it to run in proper fullscreen. Using that mod, I don't have a mouse cursor in the game... at all. Using the windowed mode doesn't let me adjust the size of the window, so I can only see about 1/3 of the game. The keybindings can be awkward since this game was designed for the PS4. There is no dodge button, nor can you bind it to a key. If I equip the taunt module for 2B and 9S, I can't use it using a keyboard. The ""flight"" sections of the game are awkward with a mouse and keyboard. If you play for long periods, it will begin to stutter more often, at least for my rig. I've had about 7 crashes so far. Most, if not all, crashes were due to using the steam overlay or alt-tabbing. Other than that, it runs mostly well. Though, with an i7 4790k, 16Gb of DDR3 RAM, about 4 TB of storage, and a GTX 980ti, I really should not be dropping FPS with this game's graphical fidelity.Onto subjective things: The melee combat, music, and story are all well done! The ""flight"" sections of the game are basically galaga sections or similar types of games. Combining that with the epic music and an epic setting TOTALLY destroyed my immersion. It's like putting nerf guns into the fight scenes of serious war movies. I would have liked them to do what games like Black Ops 3 did with their flight sections. They were simplified because the main focus is obviously infantry combat, but it did not destroy my immersion. I wasn't going to expect Ace Combat, nor should anyone. The big slow-moving jpeg bubbles of damage definitely didn't help with the immersion either. Sure, fire enough and it'll get very difficult to avoid being hit, but geez how did humanity lose to an army that uses bubble-blowers as their primary ranged weapon? Not to mention they can be destroyed by shooting them with bullets or smacking them with melee weapons. The machines are derpy-looking except for the bosses (thankfully). I do appreciate the effort that went into the story as well as the easter-egg types of endings and nostalgia-like gameplay segments, like with the hacking minigame (except for the ""flight"" sections). It makes sense why 9S is a young boy. (It's a stereotype) The graphics are... pretty bad. I wasn't going to expect Crysis or Battlefield, but geeeeeez they make half-life 2 look like a graphical masterpiece in 2017. The animations are thankfully well done, except for lip-syncing. It may sound like I expect too much from games, but this is a $60 release. It has to compare to other $60 games. It comes up short in too many areas to justify recommending it at its current price. This is a $50 game at maximum! $45 would be good. It's like selling a beat-up used car with a good sound system at the same price as a brand new car of the same model. If The Witcher 3's devs could do it, so could these devs. Now THAT is a game deserving of the $60 price!			"

												I would not play this game if you're not the best with the 'Hack and Slash' Genre of games.Seriously, at least 20 hours into the game and I find one mission next to impossible.After taking on Adam and Eve on Routes A & B thats where it becomes ♥♥♥♥off-worthy, Its still even a huge challenge when on EASY MODE!Thats my rant-ish thing over, now I want to put the rest of my review on the actual game:I firstly want to mention that I love the landscapes from the city ruins to the straight-up plain desert, its all great fun to tranverse from point A to B, even though the running speeds can be themselves and not fast enough and can take longer than you want it to be, I ADORE the fact that you can aquire animal bait and use ANIMALS as steeds, I absolutely love that feature, I have already seen the meme in the subject of that.The combat part of things... Ouch, I dont hate it and I dont despise it, but when on Easy Mode, it can push your buttons. Kind of anyways, it auto locks targets for you so just for running around casually; it can be a pain. Other than that, most of it is just manual, going from Normal Mode and up. I can get real challenging, even if you're on normal mode.I'm not very good at reviewing graphics but all I can say is I like it all. No detail. :)The menu screen and use of items is very basic and layed out for you at the start (If I can say anything, LOAD YOUR INVENTORY WITH LARGE RECOVERIES) The plain colours are a bit dull though.That really concludes MY review on the game. I'm not a professional at this stuff, so dont cry at me for getting anything WRONG.Now I'm going to get my English teacher to review my SPAG (Spelling, Puncuation and Grammar) "

												""A NieR sequel directed by Yoko Taro, developed by PlatinumGames, with character designs by Akihiko Yoshida, music by MONACA and available on Steam.""Just two years ago the above statement would have sounded like such an insane pipedream that - as a huge fan of the original game ever since it first came out - it still feels somewhat unbelievable to think that it actually happened. While Automata wasn't quite as deliciously bizarre and memorable experience as it's predecessor was to me (and I wonder if anything ever will be), it's still a wonderful experience unlike anything else out there right now.If you're at all interested in action RPG's and/or clever and unusual storytelling in videogames, you should buy this game right now. If you're not familiar with the original NieR (which is not at all required) or Yoko Taro's other games, go in blind and enjoy the ride!Though I should note that as of this writing the PC version has some issues that have yet to be officially patched by Square/Platinum, but can be almost completely eliminated thanks to fanmade fixes.

												I do not normally write reviews. But after playing through this game, I felt compelled to. As a pc port this is trash in cut scenes. Gameplay is pretty much a steady frame rate, but if you look past the crappy frame rate in cut scenes and just keep playing you will not be disappointed. Most will know but this game is meant to be played through at least 5 times to get all of it. There are 26 endings most  are throw away 5 main endings are the important ones. This  game is a emotional roller coaster and a bit confusing at points. Over all one of the best games of 2017 with a wide selection of great games this year. This is a do not miss if you like a Japanese games with an amazing story. Do yourself a favor pick this game up! Cheers! "

												I am salty AF right now. I selected to ""help"" people with the OP azz credits and it said it will delete my save with the new modes unlocked, but I thought it meant just the save that I completed with since that's the only one where the ♥♥♥♥'s unlocked. But it wiped all my saves ;-; ♥♥♥♥ MEEEEEEEEEdit: Second playthrough again ;-; game too beautiful. Felt the ending credits song in english had awkward lyrics that didnt match what I understood from the japanese lyrics. Looked up the Japanese lyrics and ;-; THE FEEEEELS. The Japanese version has such a fitting lyrics that express the feelings of most characters in the game including the enemies. I understand why the singer started to cry in the track <3I want to self destruct and load to a previous state where I haven't played the game yet :(If anyone knows of any games with great stories and emotional stimulation like this one, please let me know! I'll probably buy the older Drakengard Series and Nier to experience their stories :) though I heard they suffered from gameplay :(			"

												As someone who has been gaming for 25+ years, it is more and more rare that I am truly impressed by a game.  Nier: Automata is one of those rare gems and it has restored my faith that excellent games are something to look forward to and not mere relics of a bygone era.  At once a fully modern open-world action rpg , a bullet hell shooter, a side scrolling beat 'em up, and a top down action adventure, this game is also a deep philosophical meditation on the essence of what it is to be human.  From the lush and convincing post-apocalyptic environments to the hauntingly beautiful soundtrack, this is a game you will tell your children about in years to come.			"

												Runs well and looks good. Never played a JRPG type of game before and while some parts take a bit to adjust to the game is fun and enjoyable to play.One thing to look out for is the save system - you can't auto save and the game doesnt let you save until you finish the prologe. After that save points are somewhat easy to find but you can find yourself going for a while without encountering one.

												tl;dr Nice to play once, should have waited for a sale.Story: Easy to follow, if you didn't play any previous games, like I did, though you get the feeling, that you missed one or two jokes and it hooks you for more (sorry, guys. didn't bite :) )Bugs, etc.: For PC turn down graphics and/or prepare for bugs. Or google ""nier automata white screen"" to see common solutions. I didn't install a mod, just set my graphics to specific settings and it became entirely playable. Graphics still look nice.Controls: People recommended gamepad, so I used one, works good. Didn't try mouse/keyboard.Gameplay: heavy on bullethell elements, though you don't need to move through there in frame perfect precision. Most of the bullets are destroyable or you can dodge through. Combat is pretty fun, certain upgrades make your meleeattacks create shockwaves and you dance around on the battlefield. ♥♥♥♥ ton of pantyshots. Basically unavoidable.Japanese elements: emotionless robotgirl, young male anime character, mini-mechas, certain story elements, this game is full of this. Seems to be a downer for some people, so I wanted to point that one out, too.Hacking in hollywood style: personal pet peeves, but executed in a fun way.			"

												I didn't expect too much, coming into this game. Just some nice graphics and our allaround-waifu 2B, mixed with a weak story. Well, safe to say i was quite wrong about that. The way the story slowly unwraps is actually done very well and took me on a feeltrip, i definitely didn't expect.  especially with the ""true"" ending. (And a big thank you for whoever helped me reach it!)  Though you may need a somewhat strong computer to run it properly even at relatively low settings and it did crash around  three times in my ~40hours of playtime.Despite that, the game is still good. It has a great soundtrack and the characters were really likeable.  (especially 9s)  The story is good, the visuals are nice and there's a lot of content. All in all, i'd give this game a (8-8.5/10)  and i do recommend it if you have the time and money to spare(Everything stated above is my personal opinion and experience It may not apply to everyone.

Nier Automata has some of the best voice acting I've ever heard in any medium and it really brings the characters to life in a way that you have to see to believe. The PC version has some issues that can be fixed with a fan-made patch but it's still worth mentioning that this port is far from perfect. With the fix however almost all of its issues are completely negated.I would highly recommend this game to anyone regardless of tastes or genre interests, and at any price. It's quite frankly the best game I've played in years. Worth mentioning that no prior knowledge of the series is required.

												Confession: I'm honestly just going to gush about the game. If you're looking for a more in-depth, critical review, I'm afraid I can't help. If you're looking to read the ramblings of someone who just finished the game, then welcome.You might think that this is a game about androids destroying robots in the distant future.Well, you'd be right, actually. But it becomes so much more than that, to the point I don't even have words to describe it. If there was ever a game I'd say is a 'must buy', it just got knocked off the shelf and replaced by NieR:Automata, possibly for all time.Now, a heads-up: this is kinda a poor port, and i struggled with driver crashes and resolution issues (the latter I didn't entirely care about, however). That being said, I'm normally picky about that sort of thing, yet I pulled through and didn't let it hamper my enjoyment of the game much at all.I played through the entire game on Hard, and would heartily reccomend it. Granted, yes, the prologue can be fairly difficult, and you are unable to save until you've completed it, but I would nonetheless reccomend it - sharpening your combat skills that early on will go a long way, believe me. Of course, you can change the difficulty at any time, and there are NO achievements for beating the game on a certain difficulty. As I said, I reccomend Hard, but that's for a combination of Story and gameplay. If you just want to experience the story (and props to you if you do, it's amazing!), Normal is more than enough.The story is...admittedly convoluted and philosophical as hell, but that's what makes it so...beautiful.What does it mean to be human? To be an android? To be a machine?To be alive?To be?What does ANYTHING mean?Is it a simple difference of parts and logic circuits, or something more?The way NieR:Automata tells its story is unlike anything I've ever seen, and the endings (there's 26 of them!) are each  magnificent (and sometimes hilarious), ESPECIALLY the true ending. You owe it to yourself to leap in as blind as possible, and experience all that the game has to offer. It is worth it - every single bit is all worth it.....promptly followed by buying the soundtrack. And a second playthrough, probably.Of course, i'm not sure if anyone will read this review/recommendation/emotional ramble or not.But...Glory to mankind.			"

												The PC version of NieR: Automata is an OK-ish ""port"". It certainly has its flaws but is by far not the worst.Let me show you how I run the game:GPU: R9 280CPU: FX 6300 (6 x 3.79 GHz)RAM: 8 GBOS: Win10 64-BitMy game settings are:Anti-Aliasing: x8---> offTexture filter: x16---> x8Blur---> onShadows: high/medium/low---> lowEffects: high/low---> highAmbient Occlusion---> offWith my system and these settings I can run the game on 1080p at 50-60 fps without any problems. Knowing that my system can run The Witcher 3 at high settings, yet maintaining a steady 60 fps, it's kind of a bummer. I'm pretty sure I could run Automata at max settings at a smooth 60 fps as well, if it was better optimized.Port problems:  fullscreen mode is buggy for quite a few people, myself included. The game internally renders the game to 900p and scales it up to whatever resolution you picked. A workaround is to use Borderless Window.  white screen/black screen for some people  if your CPU has an integrated GPU, make sure the game uses your dedicated GPU because it might use the former by default  game freezes for some peopleThe game itself is simply amazing, that's all I can say. I love every second of it. If you want more details you're better off watching a review on YT or something.Port:    7/10Game: 10/10			"

												To start off this review I believe it to be of note that this is my first time ever experiencing a Platinum game. With that being said I must say I was very much impressed with this game. Nier Automata is a game that takes place in the distant future where you take the role of a character named 2b and fight through a seemingly endless wave of ""mindless"" robots to complete your mission. The story in Nier Automata isn't one your likely to forget anytime soon as it plays out similarly to something straight out of an anime. While you may like anime this type or story telling leads to some cliche character personality and behavior making my personal experience a little less enjoyable. Even so throughout the whole game i never once felt bored of the characters, yes they maybe a little cliche but its handled very well through great voice acting and seemingly perfect soundtrack execution. Throughout my experience with the story I can say that Nier provides a great sense of direction and gives a peculiar sense of wonder as you hope to discover a deeper truth as to why the machines on earth are acting the way they do. Game play feels very solid and smooth and gives a great sense of accomplishment when taking down a hard boss. Though combat is buttery smooth I feel like there's too much spam, instead of having well timed dodges I found myself just kinda spamming the dodge button while being attacked by a boss or a handful of enemies. My problems with the combat is that even after 12+ hrs of game play i still find spam to be the most effective way to dodge and counter attack my enemies. Nier Automata's combat mechanics pulls straight from the books of a dark souls game, be it this game is more forgiving through your skill and upgrades, once you die you will lose them unless you go back to your body and retrieve your skill chips. This death system made me feel like I actually had something to lose if I died and provided me some great incentive to not just Rambo and die, but think about my next attack and if I should be saving my missile salvo for the next wave or use it now. Nier Automata's combat and game play I can say has given me the most fun I have had in gaming in awhile.Other things to note would be the performance of this game and how the PC port doesn't seem to run smoothly and needs more optimization in conclusion I can confidently say that if you are not planing on picking Nier Automata up for your PC/console in the future that your are doing yourself a disservice.8/10I have posted this same review on Metacritic where I will soon provide more reviews on other games please feel free to request any games if your interested.

												This game is amazing. Best game I’ve played in a while honestly. But to get the most out of the story you really need play through all of the main endings (a, b, c, d, and e) and read some of your intel. Also, having some knowledge of the original NieR, and some of the Drakengard games, helps too. Not that it’s required, It just gives you an idea of what you can expect. My only wish was that it worked better on pc, but being a last-minute decision it was expected. The genre swapping in this game is refreshing, especially with all the generic games being released recently. One minute you’re playing an action JRPG then the next you’re playing a platformer bullet-hell.There are 26 ways to end the game. It has 5 main endings, which each playthrough puts you in a perspective of a different character. The rest are funny ones, like removing your OS chip or running away from battle. The thought process that must have went in to each of these endings.... I bet this was a really fun project.The soundtrack is really, really good too. Even when not playing the game, it makes for some really relaxing music to listen too when studying. This was a work of art. I hope you guys take the time to look at the whole picture, not just 2B's curves.This is going right next to the Souls games as one of my favorite games of all time. "

												There arn't many things I can say I didn't like about Nier Automata. The soundtrack is beautiful, the visuals are pleasing and the environment is stunning. The hack and slash gameplay has a good balance between skill and fun. The characters are easy to get attached to and the story is spot on. All of the ending are very strong and the main quest will give you 25-35 hours depending on how fast you take it. Regarding the issues with perfromance and such I did not encounter any exept the fullscreen bug, but having it in window mode and having the little bar uptop didn't bother me its alittle disapointing not seing these small issues being fixed quicker. Game runs locked 60fps and 30 in cutsences as advertised. If you are tired of the same genre of games being released over and over every year this game is for you. Its something fresh and new with a story you wont forget.-Highly recommended-			"

												This game.  This game starts off by confusing the hell out of you if you don't know what to expect.  Which is always fun.I was going to write a long review, but I won't.  Suffice to say, it IS worth buying, it IS awesome, and it IS unique.  You will be confused, but happily, and you will rage, but click Continue anyway.I actually have no idea when the game will end.  26 endings, and some endings are not endings but beginnings.  Cons?  Yes, one or two.  I WISH androids learned how to parry, rather than just dodge.  I WISH combat felt a little bit more visceral, as it's not always evident you actually hit anything.  I WISH the tutorial type beginning was a little more detailed (pod-throwing isn't even mentioned).But hell who cares.  The gameworld is ridiculously superb, the ... let's say, cast, is just awesome.  The music.. my god the music.  It's just impossibly atmospheric, and you absolutely don't care if you hear it over and over.  And then you'll get to a certain point in the game.. and hear it all over again - and you still won't care.Get the unofficial mod.  Set it to your maximum screen and window resolution, to avoid the clunky port upscaling (which I hope SE are going to fix).  Buy vitality pack.  A LOT.  Seriously.  Resist the urge to play on Easy mode, really, don't do it.  When you feel you just HAVE to, refrain from using the autoplay chips.  You'll enjoy the game a lot more if you feel like YOU defeated each boss.  And trust me.. these ARE bosses.  No spoilers.  Just throw away everything you know about other boss fights, as they're pretty useless here.Try to play the game without using a game guide.  When (not if) you get lost, stuck or confused, just backtrack and try again.  If you STILL can't quite figure out what's next, find a spoiler-free guide.  You do NOT want story spoilers here, trust me.Imagination, slightly out-the-box gameplay, stunning storylines.  THIS is what gaming should be about.  I know, after the 100 hours or so it's going to take to finally finish this, I'm going to have a 2B sized gap in my soul.  Next to a Velvet Crowe one.			"

												Yoko Taro has spent his life trying to make games that push the limits of the medium, but has always been held back by shoestring budgets and developers of questionable competence. With this new Platinum collaboration, it finally pays off.Nier Automata is an absolute masterclass game on every level that makes other games feel unfulfilling and small in scope. Every time you think you've figured it out, it changes and becomes larger, the stakes become higher, pulls the rug from under you, switches genres, perspectives, characters, mechanics, it doesn't stop. Nier Automata is absolute top tier.			"

												Spoiler Warning for minor bits of the game.Introduction""Everything that lives is designed to end. We are perpetually trapped...in a never-ending spiral of life and death.""I definitely don't write many reviews, least of all serious ones, but for NieR: Automata, I'll do it. For all the characters that PlatinumGames and Yoko Taro have given us in NieR, I don't think I've played a game in a while that made me feel this way or made me think about the ending or the fate of the characters days after beating ending E. I went ahead and collected 25/26 endings and am still on my way to the collecting ending Y and getting all the weapons to 100%. I just want to say this game is phenomenal and I'm sad that it's over (unless we're getting DLC) but also glad that I was able to witness this fantastic story. I went into this game 100% blind and bought it on a whim with no prior knowledge of the previous games or series and had no idea this was a spinoff. The game tells its story from a point of view that doesn't require any previous knowledge of the games, but gives out easter eggs and references to the previous games for returning players of the series. Gameplay Being able to control characters with different points of view of the story initially was something new to me, expecially with how meta the game was at the end, but I found it refreshing and new, and was glad that the breaks between characters didn't break the flow of the gameplay. The action-rpg style is something I generally dislike playing but for this game, it was fantastic and flowed easily. There was power behind each swing and the dodge mechanic was incredibly smooth. The music was probably one of the best I've heard in a really long time and I loved how well the music flowed into each different song without any strange or weird mixes. Sidequests are abundant and I really like how later on in the game you can go back and do anything you missed. While the achievement unlocker in-game was definitely a hit-or-miss for some people, I'm glad they included it personally, but I can see why it would be insulting for people who actually 100%'d the game to completion without shortcuts. There is also a debug room but I haven't had the chance to check it out yet.Character DevelopmentThe characters, while initially seeming a bit flat, slowly grow onto you and you begin to see the horrors and struggles of 2B and why she is the way she is. The voices for 2B (Kira Buckland and Yui Ishikawa) did an amazing job at portraying both the flatness of 2B's voice when she needed to, but were also able to portray the emotions behind certain scenes that tug at players heartstrings. Of the 3 characters, I found 9S the most interesting as a character in his slow decsent to madness from the truth of YoRHa's existence. I thought the vengeance in Route C might have been a bit cliche and weaker, but in the end with the logic virus from a certain limb, it made a bit more sense in why he was acting out more aggressively per usual. 9S's initial upbeat voice and happy-go-lucky personality slowly becomes corrupted with sadness and depression over the course of the game until there is almost nothing left but a shell of anger and vengeance against A2 for her act at the beginning of Route C.Route E Spoilers.This is also the second game series I had where the game directly addresses the player about what they thought of the characters and whether they love it enough to give up something important to help save other players. I have yet to do this as I want to get Ending Y and finish the last bit of content before I finally give this up. Thanks to MrCogneetoe for rescuing me during the credits scene.ConclusionI know this review is short and not really a true review, but if I go any longer I'll just keep rambling on about pretty much the same things and about how much I love this game. I don't own a PS3 or Xbox360 so I can't actually play the original series (will probably have to youtube a LetsPlay). I'm definitely looking forward to any future DLC or another sequel to this game and I've definitely become of fan of Yoka Taro now. I'm excited to see what comes next and the future of this story. Glory to Mankind. "

												Rather than make a review solely consisting of references about 2B's butt or blindly, wholeheartedly reccomending it, I'm going to reccomend this game- cautiously. Nier Automata looks to be a great game, but this port comes with some issues that are worth bearing in mind. First and foremost, you can tell the game was originally designed with the console in mind. If you have a controller for your rig, this is certainly the place to make use of it. For the most part it isn't bad, but there are two rather important aspects that demand their use: namely dodging, firing and frequent shifts in camera perspective. Both of these mechanics were clearly designed first with thumbsticks in mind, because on the PC port you'll be stuck with the 8 directional inputs you can use with WSAD. It's serviceable, but you're not going to be able to aim with precision when trying to dodge masses of projectiles. This is mostly negligible in the standard 3rd person perspective slash'em up stuff, but the game will frequently shift to isometrict and sidescrolling perspectives and it's here that it gets really janky. Secondly, and more importantly, dodge was clearly designed with tapping the thumbsticks, because you have to doubletap the directional keys to do so. Again, it's servicable, but it feels very weird and doesn't mesh well with the rest of the controls, especially given the amount of input you'll be putting in at any given time. Worse, you cannot rebind this. You are stuck with this. You can adapt to it, but it's awkward.More baffling is the act of keybinding. Namely, upon first inspection you'd be under the impression the game doesn't utilize mouse input- light/heavy attacks are bound to the '/' keys, and any attempt to bind them to the mouse buttons goes unregistered. Thankfully, another member pointed in my initial review that you can in fact use the mouse and it's button for these roles... It just doesn't show up or make any mention of it in either the control bindings or the opening 'tutorial' segments. I will admit I was quick to assume the worst, and egg on my face for that- thanks, Rexy.Ultimately the game is still playable with the default mouse and keyboard, but it isn't what I would call a comfortable experience, and is definitely an unessecary handicap that could have been avoided with a bit more of a thoughtful port. I strongly reccomend using a controller if you have one. Whether or not you want to buy one strictly for this game is a loaded question for you to determine. Regarding the large array of graphical complaints (blurring, 1080p resolutions, black bands, etc) a lot of other reviewers have made, I haven't experienced myself, and most likely boils down to how recent your hardware is. The two exceptions are:- Fullscreen mode. The game defaults to a windowed version for whatever reason. This can be temporarily fixed in the settings, but alt-tabbing programs minimizes it back to windowed size. - FPS. The cutscenes are hard locked at a choppy 60 FPS, and it's very glaring when the actual gameplay is a smoother framerate.TL;DR: Only just started playing, but I wanted to put some input in for anyone on the fence after hearing about the porting problems like I was. There's a good game I could reccomend underneath the host of technical problems that originate from a sloppy port job- if you already have a controller for your PC rig, I say go for it. Using that will negate most of the problems in junction with an up to date PC setup. If you don't have a controller it's still playable, but I cannot say it's a comfortable experience using the mouse and keyboard. I'd even say it is difficult at points. Whether or not this game by itself warrants going out and buying a controller is the real question, and one I'll be able to give a more solid answer to once I finish the game myself. Is this a particularly conclusive review? Not really, but I hope I can give people on the fence some additional information to help them make an informed decision.			"

												Nier: Automata is a rich and engaging game with themes such as human/machine consciousness and 2B's butt. There is no right or wrong choice, but rather the ideal and truth you strive for. This is one of those game that I can not only play for fun, but also suffer from my own moral dilemmas.The characters, 2B and 9S, have really grown on me through all their interactions. The game is really centered around the characters and their roles in the overarching plot. Hence why there are multiple endings to answer the questions that were left unaswer from a previous ending. There are those who may dismiss this game because it's a ""weeb"" game, but those are either close minded people or people who don't like the art style. That's unfortunate for them since this is one of those experience that I won't forget. There are plenty of reviews that will mention the gameplay or music, but I want to stress the importance of emotional connections to the characters. I understand not everyone plays games the same way and if you prefer playing for pure enjoyment and not thinking, this game is fine for that. However, the game isn't as shallow as that. There are plenty of details and the way the story progresses really does mean something. The themes in Nier really resonates well with people who gets attached to characters and those who questions their own morality levels. This is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ review for those who enjoy games similar to how I do. None of what I wrote is real. Please don't lynch me.			"

												The PC version of NieR: Automata is an OK-ish ""port"". It certainly has its flaws but is by far not the worst.Let me show you how I run the game:GPU: R9 280CPU: FX 6300 (6 x 3.79 GHz)RAM: 8 GBOS: Win10 64-BitMy game settings are:Anti-Aliasing: x8---> offTexture filter: x16---> x8Blur---> onShadows: high/medium/low---> lowEffects: high/low---> highAmbient Occlusion---> offWith my system and these settings I can run the game on 1080p at 50-60 fps without any problems. Knowing that my system can run The Witcher 3 at high settings, yet maintaining a steady 60 fps, it's kind of a bummer. I'm pretty sure I could run Automata at max settings at a smooth 60 fps as well, if it was better optimized.Port problems:  fullscreen mode is buggy for quite a few people, myself included. The game internally renders the game to 900p and scales it up to whatever resolution you picked. A workaround is to use Borderless Window.  white screen/black screen for some people  if your CPU has an integrated GPU, make sure the game uses your dedicated GPU because it might use the former by default  game freezes for some peopleThe game itself is simply amazing, that's all I can say. I love every second of it. If you want more details you're better off watching a review on YT or something.Port:    7/10Game: 10/10			"

												Great game with a wonderful combat system and an even more amazing story. The characters all have their own unique personality, despite emotions being strictly prohibited. Seriously, this game has some of the most memorable and lovable characters of all time, ♥♥♥♥ Taro. The combat feels fluid and has endless possibilities, whether you have 100 hours or 10 minutes logged into the game, the combat just works and is easy for new players to pick up and rewards more experienced players. While the combat is good, the weapons variety feels really ""meh"" in comparison, however this is made up for by the dozens of ways you can pair them and get unique combos. The camera in this game is absolutely flawless and does its job very well, the transition from third person, to side scroller and top-down is seamless and just feels right. Enemy variety isn't the best, even though I love this game I can't lie and say that the majority of the enemies aren't just copy paste, slightly powered up versions, but despite this, you just can't get tired of fighting them, at least I don't. The NG+ type system in this game is fantastic, although it's more of ""Current Game+"". Changing perspectives after clearing the game for the first time, and then getting absolutely blown away after clearing it the second time was an amazing feeling, this game is good for what it is, though I personally feel that it lacks replayability after getting the ""true"" endings and all achievemts, which you don't even have to work for. All in all, I fully recommend this game, whether you're a gameplay or story kind of person, this game will surely fit whatever criteria you have. On a final note, to the dudes that deleted your save data, you guys are the real MVPs.			"

For me, this might be the best game i have played in 2016 and so far in 2017.  This review might contain minor spoilers. A small summary is down below.  Nier Automata doesn't look great. It has some beautiful places and a lot more ugly places. The lightning is fantastic, the effects are just as good. Animations are really beautiful and smooth, even the transitions are really nice. Definitely better than some of the Triple A games that got released recently. They aren't perfect though, a lot of the NPC's don't move their mouth when talking to you for example. The world is relatively small, there are a lot of harder to find areas but all in all you don't need a lot of time to explore everything. Still the world isn't small either, it's just about the right size you need. There is a lot of stuff to explore and find though. Some of the weapons are well hidden. The characters all look pretty good. The models are well done and especially the protagonists look great.  Ohh and dat booty...Without the community-fix, the game suffers from some serious issues. There is no working fullscreen mode, the game renders at a very low resolution if you switch to fullscreen and you get constant framedrops. In the later game, the fps really go down and the cutscenes in general stutter a lot. There is a hard lock to 60fps and 30fps for the cutscenes. AMD people report getting whitescreens while playing. Soundwise the game is amazing. The SFX is well done and the general soundtrack is fantastic. If you happened to play Metal Gear Rising you will know what i mean. They even included English and Japanese versions of the songs, depending on what language you play. The voice acting is great as well. Both Japanese and English sound very good.The gameplay itself is also well done. The combat is fast and intuitive. Animations are smooth and most of the time, you don't need to worry about being locked in an animation. There is no blocking mechanic, it's either evade/dodge or eat the blow. Overall the combat is very satisfying and you get just about the right amount of feedback of your hits to feel good. The boss fights are just fantastic. Some might feel pretty easy, even if you play on hard, but overall it's just so much fun. It's not all combat though. There are some quests in which you have to find things, scan the areas, find hidden objects or play hacking minigames.The beginning of the game is pretty hard and might catch you off guard, especially because someone thought it would be a great idea to not include a single checkpoint/savepoint in the entire prologue and only give you a pretty basic tutorial. Afterwards there won't be checkpoints or autosave either, you have to find savepoints and be near them to actually save your game. If you happen to die, you lose your upgrades and need to salvage your dead body to reclaim them, similar to Dark Souls.Fitting to that, you can see where other people died and read their messages. You can either choose to salvage their corpses, or revive them to have them fight on your side for a while.  There is a good amount of main and sidequests, but it's not always clear what's what. Some of the sidequests are also required to progress, so it's a good idea to do them all. Most of the time you will also get some neat rewards out of them, but even if not, they are still worth doing, because overall they are well designed. The Story of the game is... weird at the beginning. The more you play, the more you will understand, but at the same time you also might end up confused. Then you start some kind of ""New game plus"" and you get different perspectives and characters to play. You do get to keep all your stuff though. Sidequests you completed will not reappear on your next playthrough. Only if you start a completely new game. Some new quests might pop up though.The game has about 26 endings, going from A-Z. Most of them are joke endings though, which you get if, for example, you die in a specific way. Nier Automata also comes with a good portion of humor, at the same time it also made some people cry. Sometimes it really is an emotional rollercoaster. You also get the opportunity to learn a lot of the games' lore. Each item got a little description or story to it. You can also find remnants of the old world, that tell a little bit about the places you are. Bosses also have their own stories, some of which you might find out way after you already beat them. I don't know what else i could say, so here is a quick little summary of the main pros and cons:  ConGraphics are nothing special.Without a community fix, the game often dips below 60fps or stutters. No working fullscreen without said fix. No borderless windowed mode.Bad controls on mouse and keyboard.Difficult prologue, basically a noobfilter.There aren't really many different enemies in the game, but it fits to the lore. Little to no communication from the developers. They promised a fix around 2 weeks ago. The only thing that changes when you crank the difficulty up is the amount of damage received. Most enemies got easy to learn/counter and repetitive patterns. ProAmazing story.Amazing soundtrack.Great character design.Very intuitive and satisfying combat and general gameplay.Easy to learn controls.A lot of different weapons with different playstylesEP, Shops, levelups, loot and upgrades.Great voice acting.Extremely fun bossfights (Even though most are a bit easy, others however might end up in a total cluster♥♥♥♥). Booty.Nier Automata is the first game in a while that made me lose track of time. I went ahead and started playing. The next time i looked at the clock, it was already early in the morning. The last time this happened was when Dragons Dogma came out for PC. If you still don't know if you should get it, let me just ask you these questions:Do you like games like MGR? Do you care about an awesome story?Are you okay with mediocre graphics? Are you okay with installing a third party fix?Would it bother you if the game doesn't feed you every bit of information and isn't guiding you by your hand through everything? (Like common triple A games. It isn't as bad as in Darksouls though.)If you answered Yes, then go and get it.			"

												While the PC port does have some issues, most of these can be avoided with the FAR mod by Kaldaien. Aside from the technical issues, I don't think anyone will disagree that this game is a unique work of art. With an amazing soundtrack, innovative game design choices, and a fantastic world to fall in love with, I cannot recommend Nier Automata enough. Note: A controller is HIGHLY recommended, as the game will change camera perspectives and control schemes on the fly.			"

They did an exellent job on the story and the combat can handle my button masshing to a point where I can still dodge in time if need be. This game is very well developed with no glitches that I could find through the like 45 hours of playing this game. I honestly can't think of anything bad to say about this game, I have enjoyed everything about it. Not once did this game feel repetitive for me, I did not get bored anywhere like people thought would happene because they heard it has new game plus or whatever. I lied, one complaint is that full screen doesn't work really work last time I tried but I'm fine with windowed, and the crashing was fixed after three days.

												- NieR's world is created with such very beautiful settings. - All stages impress me a lot with ideas and obviously, soundtracks. They always give me a goosebump.- The one I love the  most is the amusement park which gives me a lot of creeps but a fascinated feeling. Also, the boss there is so far, the very very best boss fight in term of designs (and yeah, soundtrack as well).- Talking about the story, it is quite complicated but it teaches the player a great lesson till the true end (E Ending). - NieR might not have a superb graphic compared to the games published these days, however, the ideas and designs make me love it a lot more.- The characters and stories are made in the way which player can feel the connection to it. Also, this game often breaks the fourth wall and is packed with a lot of funny moments too.It is very weird and indy, still very fun. It is the game which does not only give you a fun, but a feel.10/10 must play			"

												I'll start my review by saying that I have never been more satisfied with a video game purchase in my life. I knew what I wanted from this game, and it gave me exactly that -- I don't think any game no matter how good has given me exactly what I wanted. I mean, if it says anything, I think this is the only game I have ever not just 100%, but actually read every single tiny bit of side dialogue, every snippet, archive, and tiny bit of information I could get my hands on. That's impressive, when you compare it my time in Elder Scrolls games or even the Witcher 3, where I read maybe a few books out of the dozens in those games.NieR:Automata is a superb experience for anyone looking for a puzzling but not unpredictable story, with characters that all grow on you the longer you play. A lot of the cast I didn't even like at first, but as the game continued, I feel like I became more attached to them than a lot of more fleshed out characters in other games. That's quite impressive. Understanding why a character is the way they are is very satisfying, the the cast plays so well off of each other -- 2B and 9S's dialogue with each other specifically I found very charming. The gameplay itself is certainly a very nice blend of the original Nier and Platinum's usual affair. It's not wholly my cup of tea, as I prefer more concise combat engines, but for what it is, it is very responsive, satisfying and decently skillful. Sort of a 3rd person bullet hell at certain times, which can in certain instances in the game be a bit... hard to see, if nothing else. There is a lot of running around though, especially if you want to 100% the game, so prepare yourself for that if you're a completionist like myself. The sound design is also great, from the voice acting, sounds and the absolutely breath-taking OST, which I know is already going to be playing on loop for me for the next few months. I don't think it'll be everyone's cup of tea, as it involves of vocal elements, but to say it doesn't fit the game would be a downright lie. Some of the songs setup scenes and emotional responses so well it's -- well, it's nicely done, I'll be modest about it, heh heh.I guess this is the part where I just do pros and cons:Pros:- Great Story, that is possible to predict but can be quite puzzling -- which to me are the best kind of stories- Characters are very enjoyable and unique- Well written, very little dialogue felt off to me- No requirement to have played the first Nier, although it makes you appreciate the game more- Combat is fast-paced and skillful enough to keep you focused, while mindless enough when you're just treking away- Decent amount of character customization which opens up a lot of playstyles- Music is astounding- SFX is also really nice- Can alter the difficulty whenever and it has no hidden meaning other than challenge (no hard only endings)- 100%ing the game is at least convenient to do end-game, but it is tedious- World I would say is ""just"" the right size to not be overwhelming- Contains a few moments which will stick with you forever (a guarantee from me)Cons:- PC version has issues (resolution in full screen, shaky optimization at times)- A lot of running around- Certain side characters and areas COULD have been more fleshed out- Dialogue for side-NPCs rarely changes and acknowledges events (though I understand why)- Exploration ""can"" be rewarding, but is very tedious- Poor character balance (I don't mind in single player games, but it is very blatant that some weapons/sub weapons are way better than others)- Normal to Hard mode difficulty is mostly a damage scaling alteration, which can be annoying when some random projectiles might one shot on hard, but others won't - can be hard to tell, so slot max HP UP, heh heh- Completionists, prepare for a bit of randomness and farming- You won't want to go to work until you finish the storyOverall:I don't think every person is going to enjoy this game as much as I did, but if you're looking for something that will satisfy your desire for an intriguing story, that is not afraid to pull punches, then you may well enjoy this game as much as I did. This game climbed as I played it from okay, to great, to now being in my top 3 favorite games of all time. There's thousands of games to contend with, so if that intrigues you, I challenge you to find out whether this game deserves ""2B"" in your own top list! "

												Easily the best game I've played in a long time. Please buy this game and play it.Nier Automata is a fantastic game on its own and as a sequel to Nier which is a game I hold close to my heart. While it doesn't have the most in depth gameplay you'd find in other Platinum titles, they really brought out a solid and good feeling gameplay to compliment Yoko Taro's great direction in plot and settings. It's a game that tells its story as much from its presentation and mechanics as it does from its cutscenes and there wasn't a single point that the plot didn't grip me in some way. As with any good game it's still going to have its flaws but I don't feel they hold it back but it's worth mentioning that the grind is a bit silly near the end if you want to get 100% and the flow of combat can eventually be stale once you find your optimal setup.To finish the compliment sandwich and not end on a note of complaint I'll say the side quests are (with few exceptions) just as interesting and gripping as the main plot and add a lot of value even if a lot are just fight and fetch quests much like the original Nier. Bottom line is this game expands on everything Nier needed to and still keeps the wonderful plot full of twists and turns that will make you feel uncomfortable or even upset and is absolutely worth your time to play to completion. Please don't spoil the game for your friends either!			"

												Yoko Taro has spent his life trying to make games that push the limits of the medium, but has always been held back by shoestring budgets and developers of questionable competence. With this new Platinum collaboration, it finally pays off.Nier Automata is an absolute masterclass game on every level that makes other games feel unfulfilling and small in scope. Every time you think you've figured it out, it changes and becomes larger, the stakes become higher, pulls the rug from under you, switches genres, perspectives, characters, mechanics, it doesn't stop. Nier Automata is absolute top tier.			"

												PROS:+ The Storytelling is absolutely amazing, it's really immersive and gets you on tears easily+ The Soundtrack is a must-have+ Graphics are stunning beautiful+ Character Designs are jaw dropping+ Features True-action battle system (ala Metal Gear Rising - well it's PlatinumGames at its best, guys)+ The combos and unique move sets you can have, based on how you equip them (as Light/Heavy attacks), pretty much enables players to build their own signature moves + A JRPG at its bestCONS:- Platinum needs to fix the FPS issues** on PC version (I have a Geforce 870M can only play the game on 720p w/ Motion Blur, V-Sync and Anti-Aliasing Off)- I wish there could be Meaningful DLC to extend the Plot after the True Endings, but Taro said it probably won't happen due to Square's budget to this project. A shame, 'cause honestly this story is so much better than the bromance from Final Fantasy XV**There's an unofficial patch from a Steam user, but come on!

Nier: Automata is one of those rare gems and it has restored my faith that excellent games are something to look forward to and not mere relics of a bygone era.  At once a fully modern open-world action rpg , a bullet hell shooter, a side scrolling beat 'em up, and a top down action adventure, this game is also a deep philosophical meditation on the essence of what it is to be human.  From the lush and convincing post-apocalyptic environments to the hauntingly beautiful soundtrack, this is a game you will tell your children about in years to come.			"

												Nier: Automata is a rich and engaging game with themes such as human/machine consciousness and 2B's butt. There is no right or wrong choice, but rather the ideal and truth you strive for. This is one of those game that I can not only play for fun, but also suffer from my own moral dilemmas.The characters, 2B and 9S, have really grown on me through all their interactions. The game is really centered around the characters and their roles in the overarching plot. Hence why there are multiple endings to answer the questions that were left unaswer from a previous ending. There are those who may dismiss this game because it's a ""weeb"" game, but those are either close minded people or people who don't like the art style. That's unfortunate for them since this is one of those experience that I won't forget. There are plenty of reviews that will mention the gameplay or music, but I want to stress the importance of emotional connections to the characters. I understand not everyone plays games the same way and if you prefer playing for pure enjoyment and not thinking, this game is fine for that. However, the game isn't as shallow as that. There are plenty of details and the way the story progresses really does mean something. The themes in Nier really resonates well with people who gets attached to characters and those who questions their own morality levels. This is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ review for those who enjoy games similar to how I do. None of what I wrote is real. Please don't lynch me.			"

												Never expected this game to be the best game ever. Dark Souls series held the crown a long time but now its time to pass it to another series/game.I didn't expect much from this game. Bought it because im square enix fanboy and saw a bit of combat in trailer way back. Day after release I read some negative reviews and I became really skeptic about game but bought it anyways. (I almost bought Mass effect andromeda. Thank god I didn't.)At start was I was really confused about everything but I was open minded and when I got hang of game mechanics and learned a bit about universe...Oh boy here we go! I kept playing and playing and whenever I didn't play, the game was always on my mind one way or another. (Mostly humming those beautiful OSTs) Love the fact game need to be basicly played 3 times to achieve final ending plus all additional endings.After I finished third playthrough and unlocked chapter select I started grinding achievements and educated myself about original NieR and Drakengard story...Its really deep ♥♥♥♥.TLDR: Amazing combat, Beautiful soundtracks and great voice actors/actress (both, japanese and english), Really immersive universe with deeper story than you can ever imagine.Couple funny and accurate reviews I read earlier,Can dodge bullets but can't dodge tears.It should be illegal for a game to be this good.

												Yeah, it's annoying that they still haven't officially patched this game because it obviously has problems on the PC but the fan made patch works like a dream, and if you get beyond that this is possibly the best game Platinum has produced (and I am a gigantic Platinum/Clover fan.)  The combat system isn't as good as Bayonetta's but it is still better than most and still has that Platinum magic.  The presentation and story are beyond ANYTHING they have accomplished.  A+    The hype is real on this one.  For the first few hours I thought it was ""okay"" but then it flips the table and becomes a crazy masterpiece.

The musical score does a decent job keeping up as well for the first arc but begins to wear thin... interestingly I'm starting to unlock other music and it feels like the devs read my mind.I feel sorry for my coworkers, as I picked up the first arc ""for an hour before bed"" and ended up playing through the night : )			"

They're kinda nice, but mostly require travel a lot and even if you're going to use fast travel - they'll bore the **** out of you. Rest - fighting, main quests, npc's dialogues, upgrading weapons, dying of eating fish - it all makes the perfect game.How do I rate Nier?

												Haven't finished it, and probably won't for a while (well I start to get the feeling that there's not going to be a good ending... And I don't want to feel sad about the story for a while lol). But from what I have played so far, this game is really good, especially how well the music fits with the atmosphere (though that only made me feel more pessimistic about the ending of the game). I actually found the characters interesting, but that might be just due to my exposure to these kind of character traits. Well since basically I liked pretty much everything of this game, I'll just say a few things that I wished would be there.First... Sometimes te camera would automatically move downward when sprinting and just generally move to certain fixed angles during some movements. Though I definitely liked the fan service that it brought about, I just didn't like a camera view so low down sometimes... Also being able to zoom out would be nice too, as fighting and managing camera angle frequently has never been my strong point. Second... It's probably just me, but when the game switches to a 2D scroll game while the map is still kind of 3D (so that I need to go around corners and stuff), I found the control to be a bit annoying. Maybe make it so that if, for instance, I want to keep running to the right around a corner, I can just keep going right instead of right-down/up-right.Lastly... Maybe have a even lower graphics setting so that I can run it on an older laptop? I see how the game is supposed to look really nice and lowering the settings would kind of remove that good side of it, but I would like to at least see the story at some point before I get my desktop up and running next year (well various situations determined this). I also know that there's a mod for lowering the global illumination points, but I would love to see it as an in game setting.All in all, a great game, since whoever sees this (probably no one) would probably have noticed that I was basically just nitpicking. Get it if you have confidence if your hardware, I think you won't regret it. Don't hold me accountable though :P			"

												So you've seen all the reviews and news about this game and think 'huh some jrpg hack and slash with some fan service thrown in there, whats the big deal'... oh my sweet summer child. This game takes you on an incredible journey in one of the best storytelling methods I've seen to date. After finishing the main story of the game I can assure you that this is an experience no other game has given me. The way it tells the story is something I've never seen in a video game. The game itself is an experience that everyone should experience. While a lot of people, that haven't played this game, will think that this game is mainly popularized through its fan service, I can assure you it isn't as forced during the game and is of no significance in what makes this game great. It's one of those games you can't just hear about or read about. It's an experience you have to enjoy yourself. This is the only game I've reveiwed and it is only because I want to urgy you to support the developers, and especially the game's director Yoko Taro, so they can keep making masterpieces like this. If you are a person that likes a game to have a good and compelling story with a lot of character, then you've come to the right place. While the gameplay may have been the selling point to a lot of the people that bought it, including me, the story is what kept us all playing without stop.GPU: AMD R9 280 3gbCPU: I5 4570Playing on high everything, texture filtering 8x. Used the fix you can find on reddit and steam forums, google for 'nier automata fps fix'. This lets me play the game in full screen at 1080p with frames varying between 55-60 but mainly staying on 60.			"

												Nier Automata is an amazing experience. While the pc port may not be the best and there were questionable decisions in certain parts gameplay wise I cannot recommend this game enough. It's the type of game that you will want to talk about right away after completing. The story and music are perfect, the combat is great, the characters are interesting and the feels are top notch. One thing to note is the story doesnt tell you everything, it is highly recommended that you explore and do every side quest as it ties everything together nicely.			"

												Nier is one of the few that pushes forward what it means for a game to be a game and how we interact with the medium.This is an experience that has a few small dull sections followed by exciting events that are completely unexpected.   When you are first introduced to the open world and a few small fetch quests, please do not let that deter you from the rest of the game.I was surprised at how much I cared for the characters by the end of the game, even more so that some of the brief NPC characters for side quests evoked more emotion in me than main characters from other games.To note without spoiling, there is a side quest that eventually leads you to a beautiful area with a song exclusive to that place.   I teared up a bit not just from happiness or sadness- just the bittersweetness of the experience.    Having an excuse to revisit this place later with the same music resulted in me flat out bawling while I stood there listening to that song.   After that I research what song that was exactly, pulling it up resulted in the music by itself moved me to tears yet again.The only request I have for those that play:   Please, continue.			"

												NieR: Automata is incredible at being a video game. Yoko Taro, the director, has combined his mad genius with the elegant combat stylings of Platinum to create an experience that truly explores what it means to be human.Notably, humans aren't even around.Instead, NieR first appears to be a game of dichotomies. There are segments of high action, segments of low action. You play adaptive androids, you fight mindless machines. An army of good, an army of evil. The duty of loyalty, the risk of curiosity. It is by ruthlessly breaking these concepts that Yoko Taro and his team manage to make you feel genuine emotion for these constructs. I dare not spoil any of this adventure, so suffice it to say that even what appears to be a silly fetch quest will surprise you or make you reexamine how you looked at a character.That is not to say that it doesn't have silly fetch quests, however. While any medium uses highs and lows to accent its points, jumping the difficulty every story mission means you are practically forced to wander the game's open world to be strong enough to progress. As meaningful as the game's content is, a quest to kill four giant robots is still just a quest to kill four giant robots, no matter the discussions and ramifications that come from it. This game is not a spectacle fighter or arena brawler -- my one word of caution before purchasing is to ask yourself whether you can handle either playing Easy mode or exploring the world maybe a bit more than you'd like before progressing to the next story segment.And that's everything off-putting I have to say about this game -- this beautiful experience. The use of music, voice, color, cinematography, queer ladies, and twinstick shooting segments coalesce into what can only be described as utterly magnificent.I have never played a game that so thoroughly made me think beyond ""are these actions correct?"" We have plenty of games that profess grey morality and make you choose aribitrary solutions. Again, NieR breaks the ""do bad"" and ""do good"" dichotomy. 2B, our mechanical heroine, must make her own choices and assumptions just like the player. Sometimes you will be struck by the childishness of a crying robot in overalls. Other times, by the frankness of an antagonist who freely speaks their plans. Or, perhaps, you will simply be struck by the buzzsaw arm of a sentient oil rig.NieR: Automata is a masterpiece.			"

												Yadda yadda disclaimer I never review stuff I also haven't bought a game at $60 launch price in over two years.It's a pretty amazing game. Combat is very fun and diverse so the game never really feels stale, even after multiple playthroughs. Character movement and controls are extremely responsive to the point that even when zipping around, comboing and evading you still feel in control. The main story is very gripping and you will find it hard to put it down (even after finishing a playthrough). I am a big fan of the upgrade system, in which there are roughly a dozen of each category of weapon, with 4 levels that you can upgrade using rare materials. Additionally, you can upgrade your own character through a range of plug in chips which allow for you to essentially customize how you want to play.Difficulty in the game is managed fairly well. I played through all endings on ""Hard"" difficulty, which was certainly a good challenge (except for part B, where I felt a little over-leveled and could rely on a combat gimmick for the playable character). Maybe a little too easy, because with hard difficulty, most enemies can kill you in two hits, and you will always be able to heal yourself instantly after taking the first hit due to the abundance of recovery items. I can't even imagine playing on very hard difficulty (die in one hit) but I guess some people are tough (or patient) enough to brave it. My only gripes with the game are one that I wish the side quests were a bit more engaging. Aside from a few notable ones, most of them sorta felt like fetch quests, and they lacked voiceovers or cutscenes. Usually just a few lines of dialogue. Honestly, the most rewarding part of finishing quests was temporarily getting a song to play depending on the mood of the quest's resolution (did I mention the soundtrack is fantastic? Best of any game I've played). Additionally, even the game is open world there are a lot of invisible walls throughout the game's universe, with some being pretty jarring and unexpected. Hopefully these things could be fixed in a future game with a larger budget.Don't forget to download the FAR patch as it fixed all of my framerate and resolution issues!			"

												TL;DR Nier Automata is the best game I've played since The Witcher 3 and it's expansions.Nier Automata tells a story about very bleak distant future where Earth became a battleground between human-like androids and machines controlled by aliens. Some time before events of the game humanity succumbed to alien invasion and relocated to the moon bases. Now elite android units are sent to the ruined surface to hopefully finally reclaim Earth. If this sounds outright bizarre and silly to you then I assure that there is more than meets the eye and story of Automata becomes much more complex and interesting as you go. It is sad, beautiful and very unpredictable.Gameplay is another part of Automata that stands out. Developed by people behind Bayonetta and MGR:Revengeance, it is fast, fluid, very responsive and deceptively simple at first glance. Between fast and heavy attacks, weapon switching on the fly, quick dashes and acrobatic dodges you have a lot of options to approach any threat that may come your way. Androids don't use ranged weapons, instead they are aided by robotic drones, with variety of different defensive and offensive functions. You can further customize your character by using performance enhancing chips that allow various buffs and passive abilities. Some chip combinations are borderline overpowered but there are four difficulty options that can be adjusted at any time should you fancy being brutally murdered in one blow. If that wasn't enough, Automata also contains parts that blends several action genres together. It is not uncommon for camera to move from classic third-person action to 2D platformer to top-down twin-stick shooter with bullet-hell elements sometimes even in a single combat scenario.Automata doesn't have classic New Game + mode. After concluding it (takes about 20-25 hours), you unlock effectively new chapters that flesh out this complex narrative even more. Including 5 main endings, there are 26 different ways to finish this story that vary depending on actions you take during your playthrough.Any gripes I'd have with Automata would be nitpicks. You could argue about how worldmap is designed, about washed-out color palette, about lack of tutorials for certain mechanics, but I feel that it was all done on purpose. It is rare to play a game with ambitious storytelling, polished combat system, replayability, incredible soundtrack, chunky jRPG elements and open world gameplay that doesn't suck.I hope to see another Platinum/Yoko Taro collaboration. Highly recommended.			"

												Yoko Taro, Keichi Okabe, Platinum Games, and all those involved in the development of this game have created something very special. After completing all the major story endings and secret boss battles, it is only appropriate to write out my thoughts on this game. In short, it is a masterful experience.From beginning to multiple ends, I was completely invested in the story of 2B, 9S and all those that appeared throughout the game's long, epic story. I loved how the first couple playthroughs were just a warm up for the darkness that was to come. The shifts in game play for traditional third person action to sidescrolling beat em up to top down bullet hell is so dang smooth and fun, I just could not get enough of it! Of course, there is the superb soundtrack that trumps even the first games Nier (heh) perfect soundtrack. I already purchased the soundtrack the minute it became available and have been listeing to it since.Those of you that have been on the fence on this game should discard all hesitation if you like at least half of the following things:1. Engaging and emotional storyline.2. Fast, smooth combat.3. Sublime soundtrack that will tug at your heartstrings.4. Interesting and tragic characters.5. Unique shifts in game play that can happen out of the blue.This game rewards those that have finished the first Nier since there are A LOT of references to the previous Nier game that will make you laugh, sad, and possibly happy, despite all the tragedy. That does not mean you need to have played the previous Nier to really enjoy this game, it is just a better experience for you if you have. I cannot recommend this game enough for those looking for a unique experience that exhibits a truly wonderful story that will be remembered for years to come. If there is ever another Nier game, I will instantly buy it!			"

Nier: Automata is a unique game. There are many reason for that, yet talking about some of them could potentially spoil the experience. Just know that under all its nonsense about machines, aliens, humans on the moon and stylish Gothic Lolita androids, there is a fascinating and emotional tale about what it means to be (heh) human - in all its beauty and ugliness.Playing the previous games of the series isn't really necessary, since Automata rarely references the past games - with most times being more like nice little Easter eggs to long time fans than indispensable plot elements. That being said, this is my fist Yoko Taro game, and playing Automata certainly made me consider playing the original Nier and the Drakengard series. The combat mechanics are good. They are not as complex as other Hack and Slash games like Bayonetta or Devil May Cry, but are still pretty fun to mess with, especially considering there are many unique weapons, each with their own visuals and movesets. A Chip upgrade system that allows you to customize your attributes and abillities also leaves a lot of room for experimentation. This is important, considering Nier's unique type of storytelling, which makes you replay the game a few times before you can see the real ending. Since progress is carried between playthrough, you can expect to continue to improve your character's equipment and face increasingly challenging enemies.When it comes to the game replayability, It's not an understatement to say you haven't experienced most of what Nier: Automata has to offer until you've seen it's 3 first endings. Thankfully, each subsequent playthrough of the game dramatically changes its story and mechanics to the point you might think you are playing a completely different game.Oh, yeah. I almost forgot... The game's soundtrack is AMAZING. And I'm really not exaggerating when I say this is one of the best game sountracks ever made.Okay, now to the bad parts:Nier: Automta is far from perfect. The aforementioned necessity to replay the game may be an issue to some, especially for those that would like to experience it all in one go. Environments also end up being reused a bit much, since you end up visiting the same locations that, while beautiful, certainly begin to lose some of their charm after the 3rd time you visited them. Weren't big deals for me, but I imagine may bother some.What truly bothered me while playing automata were the boring side-quests, that, although usually have some sort of emotional plot twist that help to flash out the game world, are nothing more than plain fetch-quests. Thankfully, they are optional and only needed to complete one time, since progress is carried between playthroughs.Another thing was the grindy nature of the game when it comes to upgrading your equipment. The game is not that hard that you need to have everything maxed so you can progress in the story (and you'll probably end up way over-leveling your enemies if you decide to farm materials) but it's still frustrating to have to farm a certain enemy in a certain place for several hours so you can do the most basic upgrades. Also, despite the main characters and enemies being very detailed, the environments, while certainly beautiful, suffers from some low quality textures if you decide to look more closely, Finally, the PC port is less than ideal, with resolution issues (that can fixed by playing on widowed mode) and, apparently, performance issues and crashes on some systems. Issues I did NOT experience (with the exception of a few rare and isolated crashes) while playing at 1080p on a 970, with a i7-4790k and 16Gb of RAM. However, I did have to completely disable AA to get a stable 60fps. Every other graphic option was turned to the max (which leads me to believe that AA is, in some way, breaking the game).So, Should you play Nier: Automata?Yep, and do it at least 3 times! And then realize Yoko Taro is not even close to being through with you, and that there are still buckets of tears to be shed...			"

												Actually mixed about this game.  Bad bits first - at the time of writing, it's poorly optimized.  The fullscreen option actually renders at a lower resolution and upscales, and it looks awful.  The game doesn't place well on dual screen setups. Lots of framerate drops, regardless of how powerful your GPU is.  If it hadn't been for a mod by Kaldaien which fixed a lot of issues, a lot of time would have been spent suffering rather than playing, and the overall experience would be negative.  I have a suspicion that this is related to being a timed Sony exclusive, and a lot of dev effort would have gone into preparing for that platform, whereas PC players were given the second-class treatment. As for gameplay, at times it feels like it's doing too much - the hacking minigames, the flight-suit sequences, they felt like chores and I was just waiting to get back into the main hack+slash mode, although a lot of other players seemed to enjoy it.  It's great running around with a fast character with fast combat.The good bits.  The characters, the world building, the NPCs.  A good amount of effort went into creating these and you can really see it.  It made me greatly curious about the backstories and the history of this world.  Sidequests didn't feel like fetch quests even if they were, I didn't mind running around in the beautiful environment. The skills system is interesting, it makes you think about what you'd like to prioritize (attack, defense, support etc) and you can play around with it quite a bit. I wanted to mention the soundtrack.  It's one of the most haunting and evocative game soundtracks I've heard.  You can really *feel* the city of ruins, the peaceful sleep of the main camp.  Every track fit nicely with the place or the fights.  Fantastic work.  I would love to buy it but it appears to be releasing for CD only on March 29 2017.   "

												Actually mixed about this game.  Bad bits first - at the time of writing, it's poorly optimized.  The fullscreen option actually renders at a lower resolution and upscales, and it looks awful.  The game doesn't place well on dual screen setups. Lots of framerate drops, regardless of how powerful your GPU is.  If it hadn't been for a mod by Kaldaien which fixed a lot of issues, a lot of time would have been spent suffering rather than playing, and the overall experience would be negative.  I have a suspicion that this is related to being a timed Sony exclusive, and a lot of dev effort would have gone into preparing for that platform, whereas PC players were given the second-class treatment. As for gameplay, at times it feels like it's doing too much - the hacking minigames, the flight-suit sequences, they felt like chores and I was just waiting to get back into the main hack+slash mode, although a lot of other players seemed to enjoy it.  It's great running around with a fast character with fast combat.The good bits.  The characters, the world building, the NPCs.  A good amount of effort went into creating these and you can really see it.  It made me greatly curious about the backstories and the history of this world.  Sidequests didn't feel like fetch quests even if they were, I didn't mind running around in the beautiful environment. The skills system is interesting, it makes you think about what you'd like to prioritize (attack, defense, support etc) and you can play around with it quite a bit. I wanted to mention the soundtrack.  It's one of the most haunting and evocative game soundtracks I've heard.  You can really *feel* the city of ruins, the peaceful sleep of the main camp.  Every track fit nicely with the place or the fights.  Fantastic work.  I would love to buy it but it appears to be releasing for CD only on March 29 2017.   "

												This is one of those games that you don't want to superficiously glance at and ignore. It's a piece of art. Something you'll appreciate regardless because of how beautiful it conveys the story it tells. At a glance, the game may look boring because of how it may appear repetitive in terms of combat or progression in the game from gameplays. But Nier: Automata is a game that you can't simply make a verdict without experiancing it. You'll be stimulated by the beautiful adventure you'll have with the characters you are introduce to in the game. Try it, borrow it from a friend. If art is something you enjoy, this is something you'll appreciate.			"

Not to mention the soundtrack is outstanding and sets the atmosphere extremely well.

												A great game in terms of story and gameplay. The story centers on the themes of artificial life and existentialism along with the mentality of frontline soldiers. I felt the pace was fast, but overall the story was enjoyable at its  worst and tearjerking at its best. The gameplay is a 3rd person spectacle fighter and a bullethell shoot em' up aswell as many varients of the two mixing. The combat is fast and feels as good as it looks which is very satisfying.     The game has shortcomings though. The wild and seemless transitions of various gameplay styles makes it pretty hard to controll with mouse and keyboard so a controller is next to obligatory on higher dificulties. The game play has an open world and while I personally liked traversing it on foot that surely will not apease everyone. While you move swiftly (think Prototype) you cannot parkour and interact grab possible window ledges or wallcracks like in say Assassins creed or Infamous which makes the whole experience feel quick, but unsatisfyingly basic. Aside from doing sidequests, fighting robots and...uh, fishing, really? There's nothing else to do besides the story. That's not so bad however if you choose to see the game in a more linear way, going from plot point A to B so that by point C, at the games not so subtle proposals, you can put your attention to those other activities.     There are many more things to say about this game both in possitives and negatives, but overall I can't give it justice. I strongly recommend this game, especially to those who like games like Kingdom hearts (KH3 BETTER play this good after all this time in development).			"

												NieR Automata is an excellent game, with excellent story ideas, that constantly sets expectations for how good the game should be, and then manages to surpass them, not once but many times. Its goals are lofty, and its execution is quite marvelious.All of its elements in terms of gameplay are executed flawlessly.  They used the UE4 engines ability to support many type of gameplay options well, and the transitions between the styles are executed fantastically.  Sure, I wish they had added more to elements of flight combat, and had balanced very hard flight sequences vs ground fights better, but still I can't really knock it down.The story is awesome, but is not perfect.  All the concepts are well thought out and executed, but I feel some of them needed to be expanded more so they formed a more cohesive whole.  This is a worthy addition to NieR Gestalt and Drakengard 3 universe, and while you don't need to play the prior ones to enjoy the game at all, it is worth watching the history that leads up to this game on youtube.  That said, NieR Automata succeeded at being far more epic in scope than it ever was in the past, and is best hybrid game of its type that exists despite any flaws that can be found within.I'd give this game a 10 out of 10, even though the PC port needed a bit more work on its graphic card issues before release (Thankfully I'm using Nvidia and had no issues with this one). Still, it was one of the best game ports I've ever played on day of release, and hopefully those issues will be worked out soon.Voice acting was strong the entire time, which I just don't expect from an English dubbed Square game.Thank you to everyone who brought this game into existance. It was an awesome experience. Even more, thank you for allowing it to be ported to the PC!  If I had a complaint, it is that game left me wanting far more than it delivered (and it delivered a lot). Damn you Yoko Taro! Now to wait 7 years until the next sequel!Special thanks for the unused elevators. You guys just had to go and make a joke out of that, didn't you? ;P			"

												This review is my final opinion. I've completed all main endings, and will procede with the missed side quests later. To start this off, NieR: Automata was completely worth the price personally. It uses the medium of video games in a way that's, quite honestly, very refreshing and unique. I haven't been this impressed in years. I honestly think this is as close as you can get to a masterpiece, and I will never forget it. Game developpers around the world should look up to this game as an ideal. You won't ever be able to play other games without comparing them to this. An instant cult classic, to be sure. Now, for the details:Gameplay:Huge step up in comparison to the older titles Yoko Taro has directed. The game manages to mix intense bullet hell (both on foot and jet), powerful magic in the form of pods, and rapid melee combat with reactive inputs in an amazing way. The bosses, especially humanoid ones, are exhilarating and have many phases. Chips let you add different effects to your character: for example, launching shockwaves with your melee attacks or slowing down time on perfect dodges. Upgrading weapons and switching their position (light vs heavy attack) in sets changes up the attacks. Using different weapon types in your sets also gives you different attacks. You can even switch weapon sets during combos. While the game doesn't tell you what are the available combos, you can get really inventive with them, if you're willing to try things out. The game can be a bit too easy on Normal difficulty at times, but it becomes quite challenging in later parts.Music:Manages to do the impossible and surpasses NieR's soundtrack. An extreme pleasure to the ears. The ""chaos language"" from NieR is once again used and is downright haunting. The remixed themes from the original give off an insane amount of goose bumps. On multiple occasions, vocals kick in or the track becomes more dynamic after a more silent phase, which is extraordinarily satisfying. I've never felt that any of the tracks were misused. I've quite honestly stood still in certain places JUST to listen to the music.Story:Captivating right from the start. While delving into complex existentialist themes, the game also gives you a story with plenty of twists to spice things up. If you have played NieR / Drakengard previously, you'll notice many mysterious details. It'll make you depressive and you'll love it. Can't really tell much without going into spoiler territory, but it'll keep you at the edge of your seat constantly, especially in later branches. It is absolutely required that you continue after Ending A, as the story progresses further and further with every ending, until the last main ending, E. If you stop at Ending A, you'll only have seen 25% of the story and content this game wants to give you, so please, do continue, there is no way you can regret it.Characters:Japanese and English voice acting seem to be equal in quality: nothing seemed out of place with the English dub when I used it. I was actually quite impressed by the performances at times. I ended up using the Japanese dub for everything past Ending A by preference though. Characters interact in a very believable way and seem alive. It's nice to see them grow in personnality over time. I really like what has been done with Popola & Devola. As you continue further and further, you'll eventually get to see the true nature of the characters, which I'm sure you'll love. I kind of miss the banter between NieR and Grimoire Weiss, though.Art styleColour palette and effects such as godrays make the environments very pleasing to the eyes. Character design is simply great, and has a nice amount of variety. Environments are crafted masterfully. The different menus have a nice consistent theme. In terms of pure graphics, the game holds up very well but I've noticed a few jarring low res textures, while other elements (pods, for example) have, strangely, high res textures. There's maybe just one zone I don't like too much, nothing terrible but could have used more polish.PC Version QualityTo avoid the white screen freeze/crash with AMD GPUs, you need to roll back to these drivers: http://support.amd.com/en-us/download/desktop/previous/detail?os=Windows%2010%20-%2064&rev=16.11.5It's ridiculous, but it actually works. Blame AMD, not Platinum. The game itself runs at 60 FPS on maximum settings (without AA/Blur) even though my hardware is old-ish. However, there's a bug which makes the game render 1080p Fullscreen as 900p (?) Fullscreen, but this is easily fixed by using Borderless Gaming with the in-game 1080p Windowed mode and should be fixed soon anyway.			"

Would i buy a game of this niche again? Nope Big fat NOPE, yes i had a good time in this game, and its beautiful.. but the thing is, if they want you to like their game... why Do this to it??Play the game yourselves, but be warned, dark souls is less rage inducing from death and loss, dark souls have heart and story... but they would never do this...I would almost commend this game to be redone, and prober..--------------Just got ""What are you doing"" 2bs little secret.. hehe hard to get, i guess.So now it deserves the judgement.-----------------So first of system experience:Im running this on the low end system hardware, i5 2500k 16 gb(old old ram), and a 750 gtx ti(yeah 2 gb), but i can run 1600/900(better then the reccommended size) with high quality.So yeah this game is console cropped, meaning it will run 30-45 frames at any given time(since consoles do better that way..) but since pc hardware is more designed towards better performance nomatter the cost, the cheap hardware in the consoles need this setup.. but some guy has spoken out and done the work for these lazy developers now adays, and rewritten the code.But since rewritting your game will stop achivements from being gathered or worse(i do care somewhat, since my game runs somewhat smoothly) so ill wait in hope that they add this 60 frame fix to pc edition someday.The animations look smooth, the moving around feels very nice and looks amazing.This games Fighting style is truely something new to me, and i have not seen the combination such as this, and i surely have not seen any work this well.-------------Gaming experience:I just cant tell anything because its spoilers.. they've added so many cool features to this game to make it feel alive aswell as incredible gameplay.There is great story hidden. The gameplay is sidescoller,  platformer, sideshooter(i mean like an arcade game flying shoooter), shoot them up, openworld, levelingand special spec, grinding weapons upgrades, the game just want to be all, but unlike sanic they do it well, sorry sanic, btw sanics got nothing on this girl 2b she is damn fast in those heels but bushes, the bushes got something on her and sand piles, hehe	Your person is the game, if it dies the game die(perma death is a thing in this game, so saving is going to happen alot, but might not save you at all)Everything you interact with feels alive and gets to become more so as it goes along,  be wary of who can die, oh it crushed my heart to learn this.(but in a good way? yeah)  Theres alot of differant enemies, weapons and even more ways to play this game!-------------------My personal experience.I loved this game from the start, then i died, and noticed the importance of saves.It was hard, but now i rly like it all over a new.Still loving the game ways of making me feel.

												Pros: One of the best games I've played in a while The whole RPG element + the DMC combat system is the most attractive element IMO The eyecandy. What else can I really say about this? The OST is amazing. It's beautiful and extremely fitting for the tone of this game. Aesthetically pleasing. This game is just beautiful, and although it's not on par with most of the modern games, this game is definitely beautiful in it's own unique way and is not graphically demanding either, given that you've at least downloaded the optimization mod FAR.Cons: Minor technical issues. Apparently it's extremely demanding without the FAR mod. 30FPS pre-rendered cutscenes. All I can say is for such a fast-paced action game, 30FPS = choppiness No 21:9 support for cutscenes. It's either black bars, or the video just becomes strected. This is predictable I guess, since most games happen to be this way, but for a 2017 game, I would imagine that the developers would've placed more consideration into accomodating the fact that 21:9 isn't as rare as it was before. Lack of replayability? I won't say it doesn't have any, but after completing all the achievements and side quests and getting all the +8 chips, pod programs etc, there is actually nothing else to do. This game has a very good story and fun side quests, that's undeniable, but why not implement something that makes this game worth going back to? For example, a bloody palace like mode instead of just a debug mode, or at least allowing players to continue playing even after the game's end without having to manually select chapters.  No autosave is one of my least favourite features. I know this is done on purpose, but the developers could've considered making the game more challenging in different ways, rather than removing autosave altogether. At least have it in easier modes maybe?This game is definitely recommended. I love the combat, the visuals, the characters, and the OST. Unfortunately, the game has yet to release an official patch that aims to fix all the glitches and graphical issues many players are experiencing. Furthermore, the lack of 21;9 in cutscenes and the FPS lock at 30 for cutscens and 60 for in game is a bit of a bummer. The game is very well done, and we can definitely see that the developers have placed a lot of time and effort in the game but I do believe that these minor technical features should've been addressed ASAP. It's been almost a month at the time of this review, and people are still asking about whether or not we'll get a patch or not.			"

												It seems like a great game. However I have this unresolvable issue where the game runs in slow motion. It's not like my specs are low either because the FPS increases when I lower graphics, but game still runs in slow motion :/From what I can tell, this affects certain Laptop NVidia cards. Mine's an 860M.Recommending because I can tell it's a good game, beneath all that, and only few of us seem to have this problem. Will update if patched.			"

												This game is super unique in the way it tells its weird but engrossing story. Prepare for an emotional experience as you get sucked into its world to figure out it's mysteries. Yoko Taro is such a creative storyteller. The game tells the story in a way only a game could do. In addition to the solid writing and story, the game has smooth satisfying combat with polish and attention to detail thanks to Platinum Games. It has some great set pieces. The soundtrack complements the game greatly. One of the best game soundtracks in while. The last game to leave such a lasting impression after I beat it was Witcher 3 (completely different game mind you). This will be the game I remember when I think of 2017.			"

												As I was wating for this games release I wasn't quite sure what to expect from the gameplay but I was expecting a great story.And what a bonkers story I got that left me longing for more after i finished.Gameplay was hit and miss.The battle system and the smooth camera was great, although abit easy even for any averagely seasoned action game player.The perspective changes and the flightsuit minigame offered a nice change of pace and many of a smile over the roughly 30 hours of play.The only part of the gameplay that was ever so slightly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off was the hacking. I understand where the concept was coming from and with that it had to be combined, but i personally wasnt too big of a fan. Although there is, rather tedious way to deal with it due to switiching back and forth - easy mode and auto evade.All in all a great story driven game that left me with fonde memories I will keep on coming back to.

												*Game gifted by friend (not affiliated with Nier and/or friends) for disclosure*WOW! Where did this game come from!? In a time where we are diluted with sub par games, I am so glad that I got a chance to dive into this world that I somehow missed out on with the PS3 era (Yes I am one of the new players to this series that I thought some of you could use an impression from going in blind).  Moving on with opening statements;NieR: AutomataAdd 1 part Taro Yoko (developer of Nier & Drakengard), mix well with PlatinumGames (publisher of Bayonetta & Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance), then sprinkle some Square Enix (Final Fantasy and friends), and you have this glorious game. What does this game intel? Plain and simple;-Fast combo melee action combat-Bullet hell style range attacks via Pod companion-Cyberpunk body modifications known as ""Plug-Ins""-Etc.These are some good points, but check on the description to learn more. Onto the Pros, Cons, and Mixed;Pros:1. Fast combat via light and heavy melee attack combos 2. No stamina management (so dodge and counter to your hearts content!)3. Switches from multiple generas from RPG, Action, Bullet hell, Platform, and more4. The music is just awe inspiring. Cinematic and very fitting to the tone of the world5. The dark tones and greyscales are beautiful in this world6. ""Plug-Ins"" are fun to mess around with and configure to get the build your looking for7. As easy or as hard as you want it. There just for the experience? Use ""auto"" plug ins. Hardcore? Play 1 hit Kos8. NG+ is actually NG+. New mechanics and more without spoiling much9. The experience from the story you get with the NPCs of the game is crazy at times10. Multipule endings11. NPCs and the overall premise of the game really bring it together to get you hooked12. Booty, booty, booty, booty, walking everywhereCons:1. Buggy port on release. As time goes on, it seems to get better. Regardless, download the patch mod if you have any issues (Screen tearing, FPS cap, random crashes, Choppy cut-scenes, resolution not scaling correctly when set, and etc.) Nothing game breaking, but annoying2. Gamepad is HIGHLY recommended due to it being a port. Con for someMixed:1. Difficulty scaling (balance) through the game. Some parts for the difficulty felt off. Not hard, but at times, enemies will get really easy, then return to normal game difficulty. Granted, this is subjective (grinding, player skill, time, etc.), and as you can change the difficulty whenever, but feeling that it does change on occasion, I felt that it needed a mention2. Story. This is more mixed than a con. Overall, I loved the story and where the NPCs during my time in-game took me, but I did feel that the story start to feel “Generic” in parts of the game without giving away to much. This did not deter me from the game at all and keep in mind this is from one playthough, where with this game, things change with each, so take it as you willOverall this review comes from;-No prior experience to the franchise (Nier and  Drakengard)-One game completion at around 24 hours (Give or take due to bug fixing and moding)-Normal difficulty at a “normal” pacing (Last 1-2 hours was sped through)-Only “Route A” completed so far (doing next route as we speak)-Higher end rig (I5, 1080 and such)Recommend, Wait, or Don't?Overall, I loved every minute of this game, and I would recommend you do the same. There are very few games of recent memory that gave me a reason to really replay a game (Dark souls 3 and Fallout 4 being the more recent titles of this era for comparison), and this is one of them. If you are going by playtime however (cost per hour), then keep in mind this is one of the higher priced games ($60 release) for a possibly shorter first game, but the new NG+ mechanics and such that start after your first playthough are there if your looking for a SP game that has replay value.Edits: Typo and number edits.

												A great game Directed by Yoko Taro and made by Platinum games.If you think that the current market became stale then this is the game for you; many risk-taking desicions in terms of gameplay and narrative.You don't have to play the original NieR to understand this game, you just won't get some minor refferences.The combat isn't as deep as DMC/Bayonetta.Thinks to look out for:-There is a resolution bug as of time of writing, there is a patch in the forums called ""far""-2B's english voiceactor didn't catch her character at all, there is a lot of unneccesary sass added (just like with Zero from Drakengard 3). A playtrhough with japanese voices is recomended.-Some parts of the OST are arranged tracks from the original NieR, hearing themes of bosses/characters that apear later on in some sidequest might ruin the surprise.-Bosses speak during fights, switching to a Chip-set without damage modification when you see that you deal too much damage if you want to hear all the lines.

												Okay, so you've probably already heard people praising Platinum's fluid and stylistic combat and Yoko Taro's stories.Though the combat itself is not necessarily as in depth as other Platinum games, the gameplay as a whole more than makes up for it with its width and variety.The story is just one of those gems where it could only be told through the medium of videogames.  To those new to Nier and looking for that specific experience, don't stop at ending A.  Go for E.  For veterans of the first Nier, you might have a guess as to what happens, but I dare you to guess how Yoko Taro does it again; BUT BETTER.It should also be noted that this soundtrack is not just amazing, it's dynamic!  Multiple layers and versions of songs are seeemlessly being being played at once with their versions switching in and out as sequences go on.  Going back to how this game is a story that can only be told through games, the soundtrack also does something during a specific fight.  What it does exactly I don't want to spoil, but man, it's probably the highlight of the game for me personally.My only words of advice for those of you who do get the game:  Power through the main storyline until you get fast travel unlocked, it'll make your life easier.  And as for the bossfight in E?  [It's an unwinnable fight.  But still, we're here for you.]			"

												This game was incredible. Phenomenal. Amazing. Words like these aren't enough to give justice to the story and gameplay of Automata. I will mainly be speaking on the story in this review because it was what captivated me the most. This is my first Yoko Taro game as I have never played any of the Drakengard series or any previous Nier game. But as other reviewers and, I believe Yoko Taro himself may have said, you do not need to know the lore of anything about the past games to appreciate what this game shows you through its 25+ story campaign. I was pulled into playing all the time because I wanted to know know more about the game's backstory and history. The plot twists in the game genuinely shocked me as I never even thought about the possiblity of them happening. I cried a few times during the game just because of the overwhelming sadness I had just thinking of the purposes of these Andriods fighting the war. If you have any thoughts about this game just drop them and buy it. This is definitely my game of the year and probably will be for a couple years. I really hope for the future for there to be story dlc as there are so many questions that I have that I want the answer for. This game is a 10 out of 10 Masterpiece and will be the best game I've ever had the pleasure of playing.			"

												I'm not really too sure what to say,The first 20 minutes of my game was trying to get the thing to run in fullscreen, which ended up in a permanent black screen so I had to turn off my PC using the power button. I ended up using a software called Borderless Gaming to get fullscreen to work.I wasn't expecting much in terms of my graphics settings, and I was fine to play it on minimal, as long as I got 60fps, which I did. But one thing instantly struck me. The input lag. I can't get rid of it no matter what I do, and it makes the game hard as hell to play for me.The cutscenes are laggy, yet the game runs fine, which made no sense to me.The story seems pretty good so far with what I have played.This game needs quite a few patches, bug wise, and optimisation wise. But other than that, it's pretty good. (Recommending since I assume at some point this game will be fixed)			"

DAT ASSS... but all I want to say for now is that, dont buy it right now, not just for the lame graphic issue that the transplatform thing caused (seriously the graphic is like playing those PS2 simulator like I did long ago, SHAMELESS ME), but the developer themselves said that just wait for steam discount, yup i say it again, WAIT FOR DISCOUNT!!! and will make it a game worth your while~ OH btw btw, minor spoiler alert, Yokotaro gives us a happy ending for the first time! usually its that he never gives us a happy ending...one last time, WAIT FOR DISCOUNT!!!PS:(spoiler warning!!!)but seriously? a bunch of buildings still largely standing after 10000 F-ing years? go look at horizon zero dawn, its roughly 1000 years and the ruins looks like stone age already, feels kind of weird			"

												Despite a slew of post-launch technical difficulties, I would highly recommend this game.  The combat and exploration is very fun, and just draws you in.  Combat is fluid and fun, and creates a feeling I can't describe that gets your adrenaline pumping and makes you feel invested. One thing that I had a tough time with in this game was deciding the difficulty to play on. Normal mode felt too easy, and Hard mode felt a little too difficult to get acquainted to.  So, if you go for the glory in difficult modes like I do, expect to do a little learning.  After a few hours of play Hard mode is fairly manageable.  Despite this and the technical issues that I hope will be patched, this game is still stellar. 8.5/10 would recommend, 10/10 when issues are fixed.			"

												The game has a few graphical hicups, some framerate drops here and there. mainly when you transition from one biome to another I.E. from the city to the desert. It's all seamless and there are no loading screens (when travelling around the map) framerate drops are the cost for being able to enjoy seamless gameplay IMO Other than that, the game is AMAZING, the combat, artstyle and everything is just down to a T and the story, well. If you're the kind of person that only plays a story through once when it has multiple endings. Break that habit NOW! A minor spoiler here. When you playthrough once, you'll then get the option to save and play it again. Except this time you'll be playing the same story from 9S point of view. After that, you'll be expecting the same story again from another characters point of view.You'll be pleaseantly suprised. So please don't be disappointed with the story and don't let those credits fool you. IT'S NOT THE END!			"

												I've played this game WAY TOO MUCH ALREADY to not come to love it.I was never a fan of RPG's, such as the Final Fantasy series, etc. I just haven't had the interest, ever. But out of all games, I just decided to pre-order it because I was getting really bored with the games I play now- I don;t even have a set 'interest' in any genre in particular.But this game had various core things that made it great for any player to experience, no matter the experience with RPG's or even the Nier series:- Stunning design- Easy to understand objectives- Lots of side quests for experience- Great features like hacking and different perspective - A teary plot ( no spoilers )- An incredible amount of dialogue - Variation in play style ( LOTS of variation ) - An incredible amount of work and sweat put into the INCREDIBLE soundtrack There are only a few cons, maybe a few crash bugs that happen incredibly rarely, and yes, graphical bugs with changing resolution.

												I haven't yet finished this game's story, but I have played enough to get a good feel for the themes and combat. So, here are my thoughts:Combat wise, the inevitible question is: is it most like MGR, Bayonetta or Devil May Cry? The answer, for me is... somewhere between MGR, Bayonetta and to an extent, Megaman Zero. The combat is, from what I've experianced, pretty shallow in terms of movesets for both you and your oppnents. However, fortutiously, that does not detract from it's enjoyment factor. That's where the Megaman Zero comparison comes in. As for MGR and Bayo, it's speed and grace is quite similar to Bayonetta, but it's ground-based focus and high speed are similar to MGR. Bullets in this game might be big and slow, but you still have to eihter dodge them, or get to your opponent before they fire them. The latter is my personal preference. What about the story, or rather, the themes? Well... I won't spoil the story themes for you, but I can tell one thing: this game seems to want to make you slightly uncomfortable. Not so much as you are aware of it whilst caught up in the fighting, but in things such as the haunting German and instrumental soundtrack, primarily made up of haunting piano and electronic music. Though what genre eludes me, since I'm not that familar with those things. A part of this is the combat animations. Normally, you move like a human. However, in combat, you are dodging every which way, jumping and swinging those weapons - and though it can look beautiful when the particles are up and you are just a flurry of blades and fists (if you can find any of that weapon class, which I have not been able to) you don't move quite right. You don't dodge - you dash. Or rather, glide. In a fight, you will be spending a lot of time pulling of moves that no human could, throwing and teleporting your weapons, gliding and jumping - or both - with your blades sometimes not even causing the enemy to react. In short, you fight with little semblance to humanity and that, due to your characters human appearance, doesn't quite click right. A lot of stuff like that happens in this game.  It's a good game because of it.Also, and I suppose this must be addressed: yes, 2B is indeed endowed with a trememdous booty. If emotionless female women whom also have a tiny spot of Lolita thrown in are your type (and I'm not judging, that's fine with me), then there you go.			"

												Nier Automata combines Yoko Taro's story with Platinum Games combat to create a rather fun game. Its soundtrack dynamically changes as you play the game, with calm versions for running around and dynamic versions when fighting. Its combat is extremely fluid and getting hit is your fault most of the time. Difficulties Very Hard and Hard provide a very nice challenge while Normal and Easy are very accessible for new players. Controls for the gamepad can even be rebound completely in game without steam.There are some issues with the game however such as the tutorial has no checkpoints/save points. This is around 30 minutes at most to do once you know what to do, but some players will get stuck there for a couple hours if they refuse to turn down the difficulty. KBM is not recommended for this game, while it is playable it will be rather hard to play due to constant camera angle changes.			"

												Runs fine on 1080p full settings on my nVidia 970. Only bug I encountered was a game freeze when I changed the video settings and then continued to play.This game is interesting and unique, which can't be said for a lot of other games. There is always something unexpected around the corner and there is always something nice to look at.My main gripe so far with the gameplay is that there are lots of areas that seem traversable but that actually have invisible walls blocking the way. Kind of an immersion killer. In addition, things can get a bit repetitive in the second playthrough. Also, note that the first save point is an hour in.Reminds me of how games used to be when there were more quality titles and passion was put into them.8.5/10 so far. Higher if they manage to optimize it even more.			"

												The Best Game i've ever played! GotY and withouth a doubt Soundtrack of the Year.Story 9/10The Story was so good and beautiful.The Plot was amazing. Characters 10/10All Characters were so beautiful designed.Especially 9S. You really could see how the Characters developed.All the Enemys/Bosses had a understandable reason for their handle.Soundtrack 10/10I finished the game and now i cant stop listen to the Whole Soundtrack :/There wasnt any song i didnt like. My favourite Songs are the Amusement Park theme,the Desert Theme and Emils Memory Song.I usually skip the Credits but damn the Song was so beautiful i listen it 3 times xDGameplay 8/10The Gameplay was varied. Sometimes Side Angle, Birds Eye view but most of the time it was Third Person.It was really fun to play with A2 and 2B with their fun combos. The Dodge and Counter attack mechanic was really amazing to play. Another Thing i really like about the Gameplay were the Pods, they are so useful, you can keep the enemy on distance or poke the Boss Enemy when he try to do stuffs.Graphics 8/10Nier Automata's World is so good designed, the atmosphere of different Areas were amazing. It is not the High End Graphic but its more than enough to enjoy the World. The Characters are looking so good, i mean just look at 2B's...Lips ;)Voice Acting 10/10I played and prefer  the Japanese Voice Acting.2B's Voice is the same as Mikasa Ackermann from Attack on Titan and 9S's Voice is the same as Kaneki Ken from Tokyo Ghoul. The Voice acting was good and emotinal.Pros: -Amazing breathtaking Story-Beautiful designed Characters-Atmosphere -Best Soundtrack -A lot of things to discover -Good Game Mechanics-varied Gameplay-Your decision decide your Ending StoryCons:-Cutscene on 30 Fps Lock-Fullscreen bugConclusion:Nier Automata is my all time favorite Game. Did i already mention the stunnishing Soundtrack? xDIf you buy it you should prepare for a breathtaking addicting story and Sad Plots.			"

												A few minor flaws in contradictions with character personalities are by far and large overshadowed by a solid and satisfying genre-swapping game that dabbles in existential thought and offers a gripping and differing experience with multiple playthroughs.NieR:Automata is a strange game, both narratively and mechanically, and that's what makes it stand out to a lot of the titles of late. I'd strongly recommend you give this game a try.			"

												NieR:Automata is one of those games that you will be proud of having experienced. Everything in this game deserves praise, the gameplay, the story (Though it is somewhat confusing) and especially the OST. In short, its a freaking masterpiece. Though I must say that the one gripe that I have with this game is the imbalance of its weapons, there are a lot of them sure but not all of them are good. If you're a total stats nerd like me then you'll want the best weapons out there and sadly the weapons that you get at the beginning of the game are so good ( Stats wise ) that I found little incentive to try or level up other types of weapons. This can limit your enjoyment of the game since it makes combat a little repetitive but nothing that a small patch can't fix :). Hopefully.			"

												I can definitely say this is in my top five best games I've ever played. I can see why this franchise is a cult classic. It is unlike anything I have ever played before. The originality is so refreshing and I regret not ever hearing of the Nier franchise sooner. I have to applaud the risks they made into making this game by how different it compared to stereotypical gameplay, and how effortlessly they seemed to implement it too. The soundtrack is absolutely amazing and that it was dissapointing to find out the game didn't come with it. Interesting storyline and abundant side quests that were just as captivating as the main story. Great character design and game animations. A lot of attention to detail was put into this game.Fun gameplay, and enemy scaling is accurate. You get to play as multiple characters who all play uniquely. The game has great replayablility, as the story doesn't just end with your first playthrough.I highly recommend to use a controller, not mouse and keyboard. The port handled fine for me; no problems. I honestly have barely any negatives to say about this game. Don't be that guy who plays for 0.3 hours and leaves a bad review because it isn't a stereotypical game.			"

												To be honest, this game is not for everyone - it's too wierd for that. But for those that can stand an eccentric game, this game will meet and rise above your expectations for it. Do not take my word for it, simply go play it. There are too many pros to list (not to mention many of them are spoilers in of themselves), so I will simply state a shallow list of cons I have experienced:The chosen way of storytelling, in bits and pieces leaves you confused, and possibly off put during the first playthrough. The dialogue is pretty cheesy (Although much like a Kojima game, despite its cheesiness it still stands effective to cause the player to grow attached and to feel emotion, and not simply laugh at it).Sidequests are not always super fun, and require backtracking quite often.Those are truly the only three cons, while only one (the third) is truly anything negative towards the game. 9/10.

												NieR: Automata is about an organization of androids fighting the machine menace so that Earth can be safe again for the humans on the moon to come back to. Note this game has 26 endings, 5 being main endings.This game is beautiful. There are many characters in this game that you will feel some sort of attachment to and will love. The gameplay is simple yet plays like Dark Souls where it's your mistake if you get injured or die. You can choose your own style of combat such as adding more attack buffs to deal more damage, defense buffs to stay in the fight longer or a mix of both. One thing I love to note is that the soundtrack of this game is beautiful. I would love to have my own copy of the soundtrack/s.Overall: NieR: Automata is perfect.Score: 9/10			"

It's sometimes hard to tell what is an attack and what is just an harmless effect as well as sometimes there are too much effects to know what's going on.3.

I am so ashamed of myself that this is officially the first game that I ever review any game in any official capacity. I hope in the next life you can forgive me for my lack of strenght! I felt horrible losing your data over my own mistakes! ;m;Nier:Automata is possibly one of the only games that could not exist in any other form. It's transgressive entertainment that leaves you thinking long after you are done with it's multiple endings. It's not a flawless game, I doubt any game is, but as a piece of meta narrative driven, horizon expanding gaming goodness it's not matched by anything that I have ever seen in over 19 years of gaming.I would wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone interested in games in general, but only if you are willing to at least get all the main endings A, B, C, D and E routes. Eventhough A and B routes are a little slow, the speed and progression ramps up signifigantly after that and I doubt you can leave the game alone until you have seen all the rest of the endings.9,5/10, likely the most remarkable game of 2017, despite the fact that many heavy hitters like Zelda have already been released and the year just started. Simply put: Nier:Automata is a transcended game, one that will be remembered in the future for it's excellence in game design and direction.			"

It has a MGS'esque story delivery(at least to me). The DX .dll hook fixes the resolution issues.

												There have not been many games that have drawn me in as much as this game has, when I brought it I played nothing else for the whole time that it took me to get the 5 main endings.This game has a brilliant story that has some really moving moments, along with ones that really make you think about what is going on around you, and the story changes as you go through the different play throughs, which really expands on this story meaning that multiple play throughs are not a drag but an expansion of the original play through.Along with this story the soundtrack is simply mindblowing, I cannot think of many games that come close to the soundtrack that NieR has, and at no point did the music not match the setting or the mood of the game.It is definatly a game I would reccomend to anyone who enjoys well crafted games.

												Very enjoyable character action game with a superb soundtrack which is second to pretty much none as far as AAA Games in recent memory go. It got really cool world building that throws you into a fascinating, somber feeling world (imho kinda Dark Souls-esque) which will make you ask a couple of existantialist questions. The biggest downside is that the much acclaimed different ""endings"" are mostly no endings at all, its just a pretense for you have to power through the same content twice with very little noteworthy difference until you are allowed to progress with what is pretty much the second half of the story. What helps is the fun and responsive combat that people assosiate with platinum games and which is also present and well realised in this title and the majestic OST. Characters are kinda bland and would have deserved to be more fleshed out, but androids be androids and they do a good enough job when it matters. Also Butts.			"

ProsContrary to popular belief, no resolution lockGameplay is fantasticGorgeous graphicsStellar soundtrackConsGraphically demanding, especially 1080pLimited graphics options60 fps cap in game30 fps cap in cutscenesNo full screen windowed modeThe gameplay is just amazing. You don't have to take my word for it though, go check the reviews for the PS4 version. Steam reviews has typically become a place to talk about how the game runs technically, rather than what the gameplay is like (and thats ok, because its necessary information to have before you make a purchase). So rather than explain to you how good the game is, which you likely already know, I will let you know how it runs.Some have speculated that there is a resolution lock for this game, and they can't up the resolution past 1080, but thats false. I have a GTX 980ti and i7 6700k and was getting 30-40 fps at 4k resolution with minimal graphics settings. If you're planning on playing at 4k and want a smooth 60fps experience, make sure you have a better rig than I do. In 2k with settings maxed out, I got a steady 60fps through and through in every setting.It isn't the greatest port ever, but its not terrible by any means. If you can get past the frame caps, and aren't planning on running this in 4k, its worth a buy. Otherwise, wait for a sale.			"

												I've edited this review from a simple ""It's awesome"", because I feel that I need to give a more ""extensive"" review, just on the offchance that someone may read this and decide it's worth a shot. I want people to buy this game, just so the chance of DLCs or even another part increases. I need another fix!Don't be scared off by negative reviews - you NEED to play this game for its combat, for its soundtrack and first and foremost for its story. I promise you, you'll be blown away!It's true that the PC version has its problems (at launch and currently (26.03.2017)). They are easily remedied though, either by using fixes provided by the community or just playing around with some settings and using a controller (you should REALLY use a controller).But once you're past that initial settings hurdle that CURRENTLY exists, you will be starstuck by this game!The story will captivate you, the soundtrack will charm you, the combat will stir your bloodlust ...You WILL be taken for a ride on an emotional rollercoaster!

												先不说2B小姐姐的建模好看程度，我觉得首先就是音乐好听。蛮符合整体游戏感觉的。其次就是美工，个人觉得也挺好的。最后就是游戏的招式combo真的是我个人超喜欢的，让我想到了曾经的猎天使魔女，对于连招有强烈爱好的动作游戏爱好者，哈哈。总之全球版卖了不亏。一路上到处是玩家尸体完全就是补给品。希望这游戏在steam上可以后续接着出类似黑魂的PVP模式。我会持续关注的。			"

 Smol review Seems to be some issues with 1920x1080 people trying to go in fullscreen. Just hoping this issue gets fixed. Otherwise runs completely fine on high settings with VSync off.The game has completely hooked me in and I love IT SO MUCH.The boss fights make you want to learn the ins and outs of the battle to beat them the best way possible, and every boss brings something new to the table.The levels/ environments look  BEAUTIFUL  and are meticulously well designed and thought out.(desert level <3)The soundtrack is perfect for the feels of the game and enhance the experience so much.The characters are well designed and voiced (though some main story lines lack voices?) 2B is thicc Overall a great game so far and I recommend it to action fans, JRPG fans or anyone looking for a fresh new game with great mechanics and  great a$$  "

												Amazing game, less than Stellar Port.I really enjoyed the game. Gameplay, writing and feels included. Sadly the port does not do it justice. Things like tabbing out of the game causing it to force windowed mode are annoying and looking like upscaled 720p can be overlooked but in all it doesn't do the game justice.One thing that irritated me to no end was that the game runs at 60fps (For me) but all of the cutscenes are in 30fps. Really jarring.Despite all of that, I recommend the game to anyone who loves games as a medium.			"

												I haven't played much of the PC version yet outside of checking out how it runs, but this game is absolutely fantastic. I've put around 60 hours into the PS4 version and got all the main endings, and this is a game that I could not stop thinking about after I beat it. The gameplay is very fun and polished, with Metal Gear Rising-like action mixed with bullet hell and other genre shifts, like Shoot 'em ups. The story is very good and well written, up there with the first Nier if you're familiar with Yoko Taro's previous work. The music is absolutely INCREDIBLE and one of the best soundtracks in gaming period. The first Nier was extremely hard to top in this department, but somehow this game managed to do it.Some little advice I'd like to give to anyone not familiar with Yoko Taro games: DO NOT think the game is finished after you get the first ending. There is a ton of new gameplay and story after you beat it the first time, so it's ok if you're confused at first. Trust me, keep playing it. It's worth it.			"

												Nier: Automata is a masterpiece! A really beautiful game that was able to surpass my expectations, and oh boy that doesn't happen often nowadays. The story is deep and engaging, the characters are complex and likable. This is also one of the most unique games I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing. The soundtrack is just superb and simply spectacular and will be forever unforgettable. Combat is made by Platinum Games and has a lot of deep mechanics to it, super fun, lots of weapon, skill-sets, ways to combo and the animations, oh man, the animations are so well done.Such a unique gem. Definitely is my Game Of The Year. ""There's nothing else around like Nier: Automata (except for maybe its predecessor). And in an industry that sometimes leans too heavily on sameness, it's wholly refreshing.""God bless you Yoko Taro.			"

The game is great, combat feels really fluid but tight at the same time, evade cancels work great, and taking hits is rather unforgiving.

												I can't remember the last time I was this invested into a single-player game. NieR: Automata is one of those games that I  would hang in a museum because this is a work of art. From the characters, the environments, and soundtrack, this game gives off a sense of beauty in a rather dark storyline, which has its uplifting moments and even had me giggling. The only negatives would be on the technical side of things. Fullscreen isn't working well, but can be fixed by a borderless application. Cutscenes tend to drop a lot of frames, which is weird because I can fight hundreds of enemies at a time and run a solid 60FPS, but two people talking in a cutscene drops that to about 20-30FPS. Speaking of frames, having any sort of anti-aliasing would kill my frames, so I had to turn that off while the rest of my settings were set to the highest. Game still looks great without AA, but some of the more *curvy* models in game do show some slight jaggedness. But a game isn't just about looks, it's about actual gameplay, which this game has a lot to offer. I'm writing this review with 20+ hours of game time and I've only gotten a few of the supposed many endings to this game. With that, there are also many side quests and tons of unlockables such as weapons, accessories, and upgrades that will surely keep me busy. The game also feels like many different games at time by smoothly adjusting from a third person hack-and-slash, to a top-down shooter, to a side-scrolling platformer, all within minutes of each other, which keeps the player engaged because for the first time I felt like my hands were having trouble trying to keep up, but I loved the challenge. Platinum Games and Square Enix have done a fantastic job with NieR: Automata, and this is coming from someone who doesn't really play their games. If you're looking for a fresh gaming experience, then Nier: Automata will deliver that.			"

												I've not spent much time with Nier at all yet, but I have been lucky to evade most of performance issues. My experience in action RPGs is very limited, but for some reason Nier had attracted my attention, and I had been eagerly awaiting its release for a while. Check out my video on Nier:Automata for a more in depth thoughts-on!


YouTube™ Video: Thoughts on Nier:Automata 

			Views: 12		

			Been waiting for this one for a long time. As a new visitor to the genre, I was welcomed rather than repelled. A fantastic action RPG that creates quite a memorable experince for me.		

I will keep this spoiler free as to me some even seemingly minor details were very impactful.What I will say is that as a whole experience Nier delivers very strongly. With fluid combat mechanics, interesting gameplay decisions, story I am interested in following as well as killer soundtrack it's a complete package, albeit not bug and issue free.The latter are, from my current exposure, performance related only and thus hopefully will be resolved in the nearest future. In the meanwhile, I have found Nier to be a game to get lost in, and then very meticulously dismantle some bad robots.Edit: Finished my first playthroughI have just finished my first playthrough. Boy what a journey it has been. Since this trend is popular, and to keep myself concise, bulletpoints! + Combat mechanics: being a moron that I am I finished it with kb+m. Not ideal, camera acts up sometimes, but it feels competent enough (definitely need to fish out my controller for subsequent play). Combos are joyful to pull off, plenty of them, too, amazing combat. + Story: made me weep for robots. tl;dr gripping. + Soundtrack: very immersing and well picked. Top notch stuff. Will listen to it outside of the game. + Navigation: found it quite tricky sometimes. But that's mostly due to my incompetence. + Story development: a little unexpected how sometimes it turns corners, leaving certain choices/actions unanswered. Makes sense, and that's why ng+ is worthwile. + Overall a powerful experience with great flushed mechanics and generally impeccable presentaion.I would definitely recommend this game to myself a year ago. You? Well, the reason you're here is to make up your own mind whether Nier will do to you what it has done for me :)			"

The soundtrack is outstanding, mix of several game genres is nearly perfected. I'd give 10/10 but I have to play a little bit more to be sure. I recommend NieR for anyone who loves hack'n'slashes and crpg.			"

												I can't remember the last time I was this invested into a single-player game. NieR: Automata is one of those games that I  would hang in a museum because this is a work of art. From the characters, the environments, and soundtrack, this game gives off a sense of beauty in a rather dark storyline, which has its uplifting moments and even had me giggling. The only negatives would be on the technical side of things. Fullscreen isn't working well, but can be fixed by a borderless application. Cutscenes tend to drop a lot of frames, which is weird because I can fight hundreds of enemies at a time and run a solid 60FPS, but two people talking in a cutscene drops that to about 20-30FPS. Speaking of frames, having any sort of anti-aliasing would kill my frames, so I had to turn that off while the rest of my settings were set to the highest. Game still looks great without AA, but some of the more *curvy* models in game do show some slight jaggedness. But a game isn't just about looks, it's about actual gameplay, which this game has a lot to offer. I'm writing this review with 20+ hours of game time and I've only gotten a few of the supposed many endings to this game. With that, there are also many side quests and tons of unlockables such as weapons, accessories, and upgrades that will surely keep me busy. The game also feels like many different games at time by smoothly adjusting from a third person hack-and-slash, to a top-down shooter, to a side-scrolling platformer, all within minutes of each other, which keeps the player engaged because for the first time I felt like my hands were having trouble trying to keep up, but I loved the challenge. Platinum Games and Square Enix have done a fantastic job with NieR: Automata, and this is coming from someone who doesn't really play their games. If you're looking for a fresh gaming experience, then Nier: Automata will deliver that.			"

												My previous review was crap, so here I'm writing a new one.I was wandering the desert (after playing Witcher 3) searching for a good open world rpg game. Couldn't find any, until I met Mass Effect:Andromeda and that was horrible. Then again I searched the desert one last time, and finally I met Nier:Automata, and DAYUM SON!!! this is one of the best RPG games I have every played(still playing), and its a Japanese game, that is Unbelievable. Im not much of a fan for Japanase RPG games, but this sets the bar High!!!			"

												Amazing game, less than Stellar Port.I really enjoyed the game. Gameplay, writing and feels included. Sadly the port does not do it justice. Things like tabbing out of the game causing it to force windowed mode are annoying and looking like upscaled 720p can be overlooked but in all it doesn't do the game justice.One thing that irritated me to no end was that the game runs at 60fps (For me) but all of the cutscenes are in 30fps. Really jarring.Despite all of that, I recommend the game to anyone who loves games as a medium.			"

 Smol review Seems to be some issues with 1920x1080 people trying to go in fullscreen. Just hoping this issue gets fixed. Otherwise runs completely fine on high settings with VSync off.The game has completely hooked me in and I love IT SO MUCH.The boss fights make you want to learn the ins and outs of the battle to beat them the best way possible, and every boss brings something new to the table.The levels/ environments look  BEAUTIFUL  and are meticulously well designed and thought out.(desert level <3)The soundtrack is perfect for the feels of the game and enhance the experience so much.The characters are well designed and voiced (though some main story lines lack voices?) 2B is thicc Overall a great game so far and I recommend it to action fans, JRPG fans or anyone looking for a fresh new game with great mechanics and  great a$$  "

												Absolutely awesome game. Since the second I set foot in Nier: Automata, I have felt this familiar feeling to a game series I've been playing for over 25+ years since I was pretty young.  That series would be the Legend of Zelda series. Nier: Automata feels like a Zelda game through and through, with the NPC's you meet around the world, as well as the enemies and bosses. Where this game really shines is in it's combat. It is a hack n' slash game for sure, but it's a hack n slash game that rewards skill if you can believe that. Sure you can likely beat the entire game just by button mashing everything you come by and hoping for the best, but if you learn the combos for your weapons you can really do some awesome fighting moves. I went into this game completely blind, with only the trailer on the store page giving me a short preview of what the game looks like. It IS a port, and there are a few issues here and there. If you do not have a decen't rig, you might have some issues. KB/M is doable in the same way that KB/M is doable in a Souls' game, in that you can, but a controller is much better.			"

												I purchased this game without many expectations. I believed it to be a standard JRPG, and I quite enjoy standard.TL;DRThis game is worth more than the $80 that I paid. The game caters to both hardcore DS fans and super casual gamers. Can't do bullet hells? You only want to experience the story? No worries, they have automatic plug-in 'chips' that you can choose to use, on easy mode which performs 'attack' and 'evade' for you! (seriously you will never get hit.)'I highly recommend using a controller. KB/M is trash. Yeah, I said it, you ♥♥♥♥.If you have old PlayStation controllers, get a $4 CAD Bluetooth dongle off of amazon(probably cheaper in USD) and download the scarletcrush drivers, you cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's like one burger at Mcdicks. Seriously, you can forgo 1 burger, you fat ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥?Series connections VVIt is connected to the Intoners, the events of Drakengard, and is set in the same world as NieR. After 80 hours of playing, my only wish is that Square Enix increased Platinum's budget to create DLC. ♥♥♥♥ YOU SE. ♥♥♥♥. YOU! BlTCH.______________________________________________________________StorytimeAfter completing the game, I felt sort of bitter and regretful about my purchase. The game felt extremely short and it left me with many unanswered questions.However, after the game credits, I received a message to continue playing through NG+, so that I could 'Experience the full game.' I thought, okay it's just the standard NG+ routine.Holy moly ravioli.WOW, I am so glad I decided to continue because, boy, is it ever different the second time around!After the second playthrough, I thought, for sure this is the end. But I was ♥♥♥♥ING. WRONG. When you replay for your third playthrough, instead, you start where the story ended the last playthrough. There. ARE. ♥♥♥♥ing. MORE. TALES. TO BE TOLD BlTCH! By the end of the third playthrough, I couldn't take anymore, but I wanted MORE. My brain was complete mush. My mind was blown. MY EYES. WERE RED. FROM TEARS.I realized,my whole life, I had been training for this one singular moment.""How can I ever play another game?"" I thought. My meaning for existence had been fulfilled.I can die happy, my life is complete.I can die happy, my life......is complete....but then I found out that there are more than 3 endings. WHAT. THE. ACTUAL. ♥♥♥♥! Anyways,I'm a pretty cheap b a s t a r d, so I am never satisfied with games that I purchased at full price.I can say that I am more than satisfied with Nier: Automata, and it is the only game that I deem worthy to write a serious review for, so far.Great job to Yoko Taro, and all the talented members at Platinum. I truly hope you can continue this amazing series.			"

												Not fond of these types of games usualy, but this is a exception.Im done with the main campaigns (about 20 hours) and am going to go do some sidequests and other stuff.Things i really liked:-The story(-ies) i find to be fantastic.-Characters, felt invested in them.-Self-destruct... ''function'' (it has its great purpouse).-Challenging enough (on normal).Neutral stuff:-Upgrading/gaining weapons require work-Didnt find much function for money, was easy to acquire.-Fishing-Simple combat (from what i understand).-Stat modifying chips.Things i didnt like:-Sidequests and traversing the map can be tedious (alot of back and forth movement).-First hour or so of the game has no save, so if you die you have to start all over.-More running.-Fastravel between set checkpoints comes into the game about half way through your first and second run.-Camera (both fixed and free) sometimes dont know what they want to do.-Keyboard support is weak.Note: I played with a keyboard and mouse, it works fine but youll have to mess with the camera options for it to be nice.Lazy review concluded.

												I'm about 11 hours in and so far the game is running really well overall. I'm using a GTX 980 Ti, i7 5820k, 16gb DDR4 HyperX Fury, and an Acer Predator X34 monitor at 3440x1440 clocking at around 45-50fps in general, with AA set to 2x and everything else at the highest possible setting. It looks great, but you can definitely tell that an optimization patch is needed. The cutscenes in particular are capped at 30fps and stretched to 21:9 and it's almost killing it for me, but the game is so good and it being ported to PC is fortunate, but it definitely still needs work overall. As of right now I would recommend it if you're into this type of game and don't mind the obvious, early shortcomings, but if you're on the fence, waiting for a optimization patch might be a good idea. I could have bought it and played it on my PS4 Pro a couple weeks ago, but it's good to see developers embracing the PC and I decided to support that initiative.			"

The newest game brought to you by the team-up of moon headed madman Yoko Taro and action game crafters Platinum Games, NieR Automata plays to boths strengths; compelling story and characters and stylish smooth character action. Having just completed my first playthrough and into my second its amazing how everything feels like it has purpose, the UI, the save mechanics, everything just feels right in this universe. Backed by a stellar soundtrack and you have a game well worth the hype and the day one purchase. I will note one issue I had however, for whatever reason initially starting the game it used my integrated graphics card as the default processor instead of my dedicated one so you might have to manually change that default processor.

												I've played a good enough amount to write this review. And MAN i'm hooked!!First and foremost I played the first NieR on PS3 w/o ever having seen or heard of the Drakengard universe (the overall storyline and connections are VAST! Might be one of the more complex and brilliant storyline ever created), and I instantly loved it for it's unique story, style and gameplay... NieR: Automata adds to it.. though the PC version struggles a bit. But nothing which makes it unplayable in any sense. The mixture of RPG/Hack N' Slash/Isometric ARPG elements makes this game amazing and unique. The soundtrack is freaking awesome!Combat is fast paced and diverse. Customisation etc. is new and unique. And the death system takes Dark Souls and NiOH elements and combines them in a positive way, where (when online) at death the player leaves an android body behind for other players to benefit from, by either repairing it to get a companion, or simply retrieving the parts, to gain full health and loot... Setting the online thing aside, your own body is also retrievable, since you lose a bit of exp and loot if you die. But if you choose NOT to do anything. It can rise again, evil. Where killing it gives some bonuses... It's simply BRILLIANT!Overall I am just very impressed with this game, to such an amount that all negative things gets brushed off. Playing it made me see various videos to understand the lore and storyline of drakengard/nier. And even though I didn't get to replay the first NieR to all 5 endings.. I'm quite sure i'll be replaying Automata to get the full story and variations. :D I AM LOVING IT!P.S. DON'T EAT THE MACKEREL! xD			"

												Another great hack and slash game from Platinum Games featuring the intricate and complex story/plot designs from Yoko Taro. Do note that this port currently has a few issues with weird fullscreen resolution bugs and others reporting crashing issues. Had no issues other than the fullscreen bug (which I actually didn't mind too much). Performance was good at a stable 60fps although some of the more cinematic cutscenes seem to have natively bad framerates.

												Well, after playing about 3 hours of this game, I can say that the boss fights are some of the most amazing gaming experiences I've had in my life.

I'm playing on a GTX 1070 with a core I5 7600K with 16GB of DDr4 RAM, gameplay on the highest settings is a smooth 60 fps at 1920 x 1080, but the cutscenes are capped at 30 fps.

Controls are solid, combat is super fun & satisfying. The only complaint in that department is that the Lock-On feature feels weak, wish it would auto-lock-on to the next target.

												The music for this game is amazing. The character designs and settings are absolutely beautiful, and the cutscene are enthralling. The controls for movement and combat are smooth and responsive, and the combat itself is high paced and challenging.Only problem I've encountered so far was a bug with my AMD Graphics Card drivers, however I've gotten around that by downgrading to 16.11.5; I recommend you do the same if you have an RX4xx and get the white-screen glitch.I just hope the driver bug gets fixed soon so I don't have to worry about updates. Aside from that, I'm absolutely in love with NieR:Automata.			"

												This game has fishing, so it's a 10/10 for me. Okay time to get serious, this game is actually beautiful but as I write this review it does have a few frame rate issues on occasion. However, it's not a bad game and runs well 99% of the time (I'm using an i5 processor and 970 GTX). There are tons of things to do, but the one thing I will say is that the fighting seems a little repetitive for a hack and slash, but maybe because I'm spoiled from Devil May Cry. The story is a bit convoluted, but the story isn't why I got this game. I was hoping for something along the lines of Kingdom Hearts or FFXV gameplay and it does live up to that somewhat. Is it worth $60? Probably not, but it's still fun. I'd wait until they do better porting for this game or it goes on a steeper sale. Overall: 7.5/10  "

												Nier Automata is a patchily optimised, derivative and linear game. One that likely cuts these corners under the pretense of having to lump on top it's mechanical development the aesthetic and thematic sensibilities of something that resembles Square Enix's self-image as a first rate developer of original fantasy titles. Platinum, a developer that can be heard over the wall crashing entrance of new Capcom, Konami and Enix titles faintly playing a second fiddle to them has been burdened with reeds and pages and a restrictive suit for this new recital and it can make the presentation (marketing) buckle it. Nier Automata is also without a shadow of a doubt the best game of the past five years. It is utterly definitive of a developer trying to do something constructive and exciting with the heart and head war that exists in contemporary design sensibilities. That is, do we make something for people that is fluid, structured, engaging and that tethers their emotional experience to distinctive pacing but is all the more linear as a result? Or do we the developer make something that is open, grants autonomy to the player, lends possibility to every situation and entices them with that irresistible premise that their experience of the game is going to be unique from everyone else’s? What Platinum have managed to do with Nier Automata is to create the most seamless, fluidly shifting fifty fifty balance of those two sets of rules and not a single one is worse for the presence or absence of the other. While one is keenly aware that the number and variety of mechanics (not one of them imprecise or poorly implemented) were 'traded in' by the guys at Platinum for more marketable spectacle, likely run as interference by Square Enix. But given Platnum's experience of dishing out this level of spectacle and their almost unique ability to marry it to visceral, frenetic gameplay, all the moments that look for all the world like they belong in an anime opening or a cutscene in a turn based strategy game or even in a visual novel are threaded in perfectly with those moments that you boast to your friends about pulling off, or that you try to boast about discovering first in your walkthrough. The relationship this balance of expected set-up and curveballs in execution that the core game has with it's own narrative is, to my view, the conceit of it's very design that ellevates it above the other major hack and slash adventure titles released this quarter with times upon times the marketting budget. You start this procedural genre-aware, mission based hack and slash swooping in to enemy territory on a mecha-plane contraption as a rank and file member of an android army. When you're immediately ambushed and put into the commander's position you must dogfight your way to relative safety from out of nowhere in the middle of the opening cutscene. You, 2B - the android caught up in this cluster♥♥♥♥ and the poor level desginer who had to shred all of his copies of the player being sat in a tutorial simulation or something experience the same violation of expectation - and in a very good way. This constant upscaling of how you fight, what you fight and why you're fighting it ripples throught he entire narrative, expressing itself at junctions of meaningful choice and fufilling exploration as well as distinct shifts in stakes, tone and of course difficulty level. The mechanics of this game and the world it renders with them are part of the exact same digesis. Fluff and crunch are united in making the visceral painful and the wonderous explorable. This breathing of life and meaning into a set of future sci-fi images and ephemera is utterly in line with the games' relatively complex themes and the wonderous tone this strikes is kept in line with the often action-packed pace of your adventure with a soaring, genuinely thespian score. By the time you have landed in enemy territory and must see for yourself what soulless machines have done with the earth that humanity has cultivated by the end of it's modern existence, you realise that actually there is quite a time limit on your life, that the same mechanics that controlled that ship and the mecha and your sword and your droid are all the same five or six buttons, that the machines are a somewhat bland opponent to start such a spectacular game with, you'll realise that nothing could be more appropriate for the story you're playing through. Much the same way that an artisanal film is going to use a confluence of sound and visual, still and moving, loud and quiet to craft it's digesis, Nier Automata pulls from the spice rack every conceivable piece of intrigue and excitement from Shonen Anime, Science Fiction literature, Post-Apocalyptic Fiction, Visual Novels, Arcade Games, Tabletop Games and just a few fun as ♥♥♥♥ hack and slashers to propell you along this adventure. But each perfectly timed dodge, each newly discovered secret, each well-earned upgrade and each eviscerated boss reminds you that you have the keys, the throttle and the steering in hand.In the form of your controller, not your keyboard, because Jesus ♥♥♥♥ing Christ.

 If there was ever a debate as to whether video games are art, NieR: Automata proves that they are. This is not Platinum Games' best game in terms of raw action gameplay, but it is Platinum's best game in general. And THE best game in general. Nier does a huge variety of things and does them all so well that it's impossible not to fall in love with the game. Gameplay Nier Automata initially starts off playing like any other Platinum Game. Fast paced, satisfying combat with a heavy reliance on player skill that provides a decent challenge. Though the challenge in Nier is much less than other Platinum Games (It doesn't come close to Metal Gear Rising in that respect), it does not detract from the experience. The combat and variety in gameplay styles between the characters is outstanding, and the RPG gameplay elements fit well in it. Levelling is a mere incremental increase in stats, but it still feels rewarding nonetheless, and the upgrade systems for Weapons, PODs and Chips helps the player feel as though they are actually progressing their character, and at no point do these upgrades really feel like they are taking too long or too quick; though certain upgrades for certain things can be extremely expensive and mildly irritating to discover how to get the required materials to create. The semi-open world works. Each area is very distinct and serves it's purpose with a variety of sidequests to complete; though not all sidequests are great. Sidequests are easily the biggest flaw in the gameplay of Nier: Automata. Some of them are fine, e.g. Photographs, Family Squabble though many are not (the worst offender for me being the repetitive, uninteresting back and forth walking of Jean Paul's Melancholy). Story This is by far the strongest element of Nier: Automata and is what I believe to be what makes this game a masterpiece, a work of art. The story of Nier: Automata may initially seem very generic, but it soon becomes very interesting, slightly convoluded, but always gripping (especially in the later two campaigns). Honestly, saying anything about the story of Nier: Automata would ruin it. Trust me here, you need to experience the brilliance of this for yourself without any previous knowledge. Sound Design (Music, Voice, Etcetera) Also pretty damn good, with some exceptions for the at times questionable English voice acting. To start off, the soundtrack to this game is downright beautiful, with each track fitting where and when they appear perfectly and causing ear-♥♥♥♥♥♥s to any and all listeners. The composer did an absolutely stellar job with the music for Nier: Automata. The sounds during gameplay and combat are fine, sounding and feeling almost exactly how you would expect them to and doing their job as well as they possibly could, though combat can sound a little repetitive with the expected metal-on-metal clashing sounds you would get from sword on machine. The voice acting is where problems start to crop up. On the main characters, voice acting in English is good. Not great, but good (though it does become outstanding all of a sudden during some of the more emotional and important plot moments). The problem is that almost every side character in the game sounds awful with the English VA, which means if you wanna understand what you're hearing you may have to put up with cringeworthy voices from time to time. I do have to mention that the VA in English for 9S is brilliant throughout though. Conclusion Nier: Automata is the closest thing to perfect you'll ever see in a game. Everything it does, it does well with a few flaws. It's stupidly fun, extremely engaging and my new favourite game of all time.			"

												There’s a principle in video game design that Sid Meier calls “the Covert Action rule”. To quote Meier himself, the rule states “Don't try to do too many games in one package”. After four hours of NieR:Automata, I can only conclude that either the developers have never heard of the Covert Action rule, or they have heard of it but treat it with the utmost contempt. Within a single mission, often within a few minutes, the game goes from bullet hell to platformer to twin-stick shooter to hack’n’slash, all within the confines of an open world RPG.The strange thing is that all of this just works. The developers have managed to not only grasp the fundamentals of all these different types of games, but also make them work within a singular, easy to grasp control scheme and make the flow from scene to scene and genre to genre feel natural. Every mission so far has been a thrill ride where you can’t really tell what’s coming next.If it all plays delightfully weird, it also feels delightfully weird. Playing NieR:Automata is like playing a strange sci-fi anime, one where all the android soldiers are blindfolded gothic lolitas and all the enemies are thoroughly rusted cute-ugly robots communicating through confused soundbites and nothing is adequately explained. You just have to go with the flow and try to figure out the plot from hints.It might not be the best game I’ve played this year (although it comes close), but it is by far the coolest.			"

												This game has so much potential but I can't recommend this game in its current state. This game has not let me progress past the first 10 minutes of the intro. My frustration was further enhanced when Square Enix tech support only recommended checking GPU drivers. Myself and many others have been experiencing crashes, white screens, and resolution bugs. I have a 780ti which apparently is the card with the most problems but I have read of the same problems plaguing 900 series cards as well. I will adequately revise my review when the devs release a patch to fix this game. Until then I would advise 700 and 900 series card owners to postpone their purchase.			"

												Good game, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port. The gameplay is fun, nice mix of rpg, hack and slash and 2D scrolling. However the experience is ruined for me when I cant hit stable 60 fps and 1080p fullscreen is simply an upscaled version of the game and not true 1080p. The game runs at 60 fps ish with everything on low and window mode, however the cutscenes feels like 5 fps. Before they patch it and the game can actually run in fullscreen at true 1080p stable 60 fps I cant really recommend this game. My specs:gtx980 amp edition16gig rami74790k			"

												A sequel to Platinum's Transformers Devastation, Nier Buttomata is set after the bad ending where Megatron succeeded in roboticizing Earth.Also 2B is NOT HUMAN SHE IS A ROBOT STOP THINKING IMPURE THOUGHTS ABOUT HER. SHE IS AN APPLIANCE NOT A PERSON.Yoko Taro is an accurate assessor of how good his games are. Apart from animations and 2B's ♥♥♥, he has done everything possible to sabotage Platinum's usual level of quality. The result is a mess, a game with combat shallower than Korra, but with all the joys added of really boring shmup segments, and all the parts of Monster Hunter that aren't actually fighting monsters (So running through empty fields to collect shiny grindbits in hopes they will upgrade your weapon or a weapon you collect down the line.)But what about the plot? Well, it's typical Taro: ""Machines don't have feelings,"" your blindfold wearing* protagonists intone as the robots proceed to display feelings in such a childish and goofy manner that it feels like this is some clown world cartoon... before you cut them all down ruthlessly**. 2B drops some loaded dialogue early on that practically spoils the whole game, too, but you don't get confirmation of this until much later because this game wastes your time immensely. You ""clear"" the game and get ""Ending A"" without a SINGLE thing of note happening in the plot. Then you're asked to do it all again, only with most action bits replaced with even more boring shmup segments if that's even possible. It's only until the THIRD play where the plot finally comes together. Even Nier 1 gave you a ""complete"" game with a real ending on the first play. (Oh and this means you play as the bootily-endowed heroine for less than half your game time.)  And in traditional Taro fashion, the actual finale wraps up so that everything is so utterly terrible that it blows right past depressing and into laughable clown-world territory again. There is no good, no evil, no heroism, nothing in Taro's world but sobbing, childlike victims of cataclysms so far in the past and so arbitrary as to be meaningless. The combat balancing is completely screwed up and nobody will ever notice it because on Normal it is nearly impossible to die. On Hard, you die in 2 hits, Ultra Hard 1 hit, and checkpoints are almost non-existant, usually in the 20-40 minute range, and most of that being awful unskippable chatter. And of course the hitboxes make From games look positively artisitic in that regard. And if it's not the hitboxes, it is the terrible camera work, often purposefully obscuring the action for absolutely no reason. Or the combat effects, so overdone to obscure reading the battle. Or that one major boss is fought in a literal dust storm, preventing you from seeing what he's doing half the time.Look, there's fun to be had here. Even a bad Platinum game is better by miles than most. Sprinting through fields, collecting goodies, slicing robots is just going to be fun no matter what, but on every other level this is flatly a mediocre and disappointing game.*(HRRRM I WONDER WHAT DEEP TARO SYMBOLISM IS MEANT BY THAT)**(Because of course the machines can't just be humans. They're autistic dopey adorable little kid humans that cry about their brothers because Taro can't make a plot work without crass emotional manipulation.)			"

												I really did want to leave a positive review for something I had been waiting so painstakingly long for, but as of right now i sadly cannot. The game, while working for a majority of the community, does not for a lot of us who purchased the game in faith that it would be a stable port. Sadly, between framerate drops, an immense amount of whitescreen and crashing bugs, as well as a complete lack of feedback or PR from SE, i'll have to leave this negative review until the decide to fix something.

In my specific case, I get a constant white screen which crashes the game and makes it impossible to even progress.

												Poor port. They postponed to implement Denuvo but didn't think it might be a good idea to put a bit of time into actually beta testing the game.You can't play fullscreen and select your resolution. Pick one. Or, you know, you'll have to rely on a third party app to make it work.I will write a complete review when I actually get past the crashes - wait, did I mention the crashes ? - that occur, forcing me to restart the game since the prologue doesn't save (which isn't a problem really, except, you know, crashes).Now I'll get back to try playing it, because who knows, there seems to be an amazing game beneath this Denuvo-ridden shіt sloppy job of a port.Wait for the free version or patches.

												TLDR:Gameplay: 10/10 it's fun, solid controls. Action packed. Great stuff.Audio: 10/10 best soundtrack of the year. The voice acting sounds good. Etc etc.Visuals: 7/10 game looks good. Nothing amazing nothing bad either.Seems like a solid game. Performance has been great. Game has been fun. I played for an hour and have to go to work. I don't want to go to work. Gah.Ok. So obviously I like the game: you guys are for some reason not buying the game and need me to tell you why to buy it. I get it, $60 is preposterous and you can't make up your own opinion in 2 hours and refund if needed so below tells you why to buy it.Gameplay: Solid control. Responsive controls. I'm using xbox1 controller by the way. These are must haves because this game is quick with loads of action. Mind you I'm playing in normal and it isn't overly hard which is great. Always my fear that these action games can be too hard and demanding which means I can't play it. (Harder modes are definitely harder, I tried haha)So aside from the great controls the actual style of gameplay is fantastic. Seamlessly going from top down shooter, side scroller/platformer third person fee camera styles and more, each style plays similar but different and I love it. Really keeps you engaged.I was playing in top down, got knocked back into a side room and the camera seamlessly follows switching perspectives. Some big robot was in there so I kick his ♥♥♥ through the door, changing perspectives and proceeding to continue my battle. It's really thrilling and needs tried not explained.Audio: English and Japanese voice acting. I tried both. Both sound good. Always a fear the English sounds incredibly cheesy and fake. The soundtracks in the game are hands down ♥♥♥♥ing awesome.Visuals: nothing fancy nothing bad. Looks better than the trailers by a good amount though. I cranked aliasing textures and postprocessing to max. Off by default. I use sli 1080 it's probably only using 1 but meh. Most games don't support sli.Performance has been great. No slowdowns. Like I mentioned I turned aliasing and other things all the way up. Looks much better than the trailers.The game is much better than wildlands and for honor and some of the other ""big"" games out right now. Try it for yourself.

												A good game and an improvement in many aspects compared to the first NieRIn terms of the port quality, Borderless Gaming (free on GitHub) fixes many issues that playing in full screen can currently give (fps drops, stutters, upscaling of 900P instead of the native resolution chosen) but those issues should eventually be patched. The pre-rendered cutscenes only run at 30FPS and stutter a lot.55-60FPS on highest quality settings with 4X anti-aliasing at 1080P (GTX 1070, i7 7700k, 16GB 3200MHz)Check that you meet the system requirements, lots of the negative reviews for this game are complaints that they can not play at 1080P @60fps when they don't even meet the minimum requirements (which by the way says 1280x720, not 1920x1080)			"

												Really fun game overall and in my opinion lives up to the expectations, the port is so-so, not the best ive seen but not the worst either, controls work relatively well except for the dodge command which is pretty damm hard to pull of consistently with apropiate timing on account of it being a double tap of the direction keys. Performance wise as everyone has said there are a number of issues that have somewhat decent workarounds for now, but I hope will be fixed in the future. For any potential buyers, solution for white screen crash (for the most part) turn off blur and AA.Playing full screen without odd letterbox thingy (at least for me) do this: http://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/17306/how-to-force-maximized-fullscreen-mode-in-any-gameOverall, great game and I seriously recommend it, If you are debating between getting the PC and PS4 version, the console one might be a better choice for now.

												Aside from the annoying fullscreen resolution bug and bad AA performance (both of which I assume will be patched) this is pretty much everything I could have wanted from a game I never thought would see the light of day, much less on PC.  Kudos to SE for farming this one out to Platinum so we could see some of their famous spectacle fighter mechanics brought to Nier.  N:A's movement is ultra responsive with just enough weight added to it to give the gameplay the punch it needed over its predecessor's wet noodle combat.

												This is a review from about 10 hour into the game. Tldr; I reccomend this and rate it a 7/10. The best part of this game is the main characters;  they have the best models and their dialogue is very character defining. They stand out in this game and I find that important in a game that:looks like its many years dated in graphics and whoes side missions and story are very mediocre so far. the combat is a feels great, looks deep and hard kind of system that really doesn't utilize that too much. the skills you get will greatly alter how combat is defined and experience and while it is awesome once you look at it this was not the game I was hoping for, basically something sorta like dark souls. There is a lot of myustery that tugs on many gamers penchant to hold back in item usage but it really doesn't matter at all. I say this for normal mode only where it is still easy to die but only if you dont pay attention... otherwise when you get used to dodging it becomes a much easier game to win with.That said, I do still find the sombat enjoyable and the bland environments are at least interesting enough for me to find interest in exporation. The story is a bit intrigueing but definitely not unique on the slightest sense so far (if you are into sci fi genere works) and there are tales of having to play this game multiple times to find out what is actually going on in the story. Overall I rate this a 7/10 because it doesn't do anything poorly but doesn't seem to excell in any sort of area besides main character immersion.			"

												Just finished the game, got the endings A K W from 1 play through. Apparently multiple routes you can take, I think A is probably best ending but still leaves many answers unanswered. The design and everything is generally very engaging and definately will entice you to replay the game multiple times for different endings! The characters (especially 2B) is really likable from my experience. The music is simply outstanding. The artstyle is very unique and lovely, as long as you are okay with most of the game being in a ruined city greyish (there are 3 sections with different themes that I encountered so far from 1 play through).For my more technical thoughts see below.This game is pretty awesome, however if you do not have a controller don't expect to enjoy it as much with Mouse and Keyboard. You cannot dodge the same way you can with a controller with KB+M due to no dedicated button for evasion. Also the visuals on wide screen is kind of strange during cutscenes (probably stretched slightly or something), and there aren't many graphical customizations other than low medium and high. If you do not meet the minimum requirements for the specs you may find quite a few problems with the fps according to the community.Required:Specs to meet the game min.Controller for more enjoyment.Borderless gaming program for best resolution + borderless full screenPro:Game play is quite funVisuals is beautiful if not hindered by some glitches with the resolution at times switching to 720p for no reason. (Only in full screen.)Has Japanese voice/ English voice. Japanese voice is far superior (and the protagonist simply has a very likeable Jap voice)Cons:M+KB doesn't play that well in certain views (game switches from FPS/TPS/Top down/ many other)Cannot rebind evasion, cannot make Shift a toggle for shootingSome glitches and bugs (will probably be ironed out by the community)Cinematics are low fps and sometimes sutter for me (even though I have really high spec pc, however I use a 3440x1440 monitor)No borderless fullscreen. If you minimize at times you might be stuck with a mouse cursor on the screen so you need to save and restart the game to get rid of it... However there is no autosave. And you must find save points. Not to mention sometimes after minimizing your game is stuck in window mode. And if you are stuck in a cutscene you cannot change it back to full screen until you regain control of the game. Well you are stuck with watching those emotional/beautiful cutscenes in windowed mode with stutter and a mouse cursor in the middle if that happens to you (happened to me), unless you want to replay the whole section, since there is no auto save... (this can all be fixed by borderless gaming)			"

												I literally had never heard of this game until today. I saw it on the Steam New Releases board, and clicked on it. I saw the overwhelmingly positive reviews, and decided to give it a shot. ((Apparently my friends have been salivating over this game for months since the saw the trailers, and had no idea it was out???))Holy. Crap. The story is sucking me in. I don't want to spoil anything, but man is it good, and some of the characters you meet along the way are definately memorable.The combat and gameplay overall aren't anything new and exciting I'd say. But the graphics, the story, and the dialoge are good.It's been awhile since I've not want to put down a game.			"

												13 hours played, ~4 year old PC upgraded with a GTX 970. Playing with an XBox 360 controller (worked out of the gate). The only technical issue I ran into was the fullscreen resolution bug, worked around it with windowed mode + Borderless Gaming. Since then everything works flawlessly, excellent framerate (there is the odd 2 second hitch when it loads in new areas). Very good about loading times.Gameplay is a joy to play for the most part. The camera and auto-aim fail at times and some of the finer points of the game's rules are seemingly left for the player to figure out through trial and error. Playing on normal the game is too easy but does feature the odd sudden difficulty spike.What takes it from good fun to remarkable are the setting, melodrama, comedy and weirdness. So far the story has been rather straight forward but I've not yet completed the first ending, so looking forward to more.			"

												Most refreshing game to play in a long time. The world is one that you want to stay in for hours and hours. There's a whole lot of replay value here. The story might not be amazing but it's fun and the characters are androids so how deep can it be anyway. 2B's booty is a big plus too. ;)My only issue with the game is the framerate during the cutscenes can be horrible. Using a GTX 970 at the moment so it is not the recommended card but still, the game runs fine until the cutscenes so I don't think the graphics card is the thing to blame.EDIT 1: Playing with the game with the latest version of FAR makes the game run pretty smooth now. Framerate was not as much of an issue for me as the stuttering.EDIT 2: I pretty much completed all that is neccessary and really my only complaint about the game itself is the fact that the difficulty scaling on normal was pretty bad. I got to level 71 and it was OOOOVVERRKILL. Way too easy.			"

												Nier Automata is a great game with a very interesting blend of action rpg and bullet hell. The camera itself adapts to these changes in combat which makes for a very interesting, admittedly jarring experience. The story is absolutely beautiful and I cried like a little baby. My only regret is not playing this in bite size pieces to really soak up the emotions, but thats hard to do when the combat and story are just so fun and engaging that I can't stop playing it.So lets do what everyone does and list the pros and cons about the game:Pros:- Combat: Its Platinum, so yeah the combat is amazingly fun. The blend, although it doesn't seem like it would work, works really well. Think DMC or Bayonettas use of guns. They aren't OP and you definitely won't rely on them too much for combat, but they help as a finisher and to take out arial targets, as well as add damage.- Characters: 2B, 9S and YorHa Androids, as well as defectors, are all pretty interesting. Granted I don't like 9S, but as the story unravels you really start to like him a bit more. Otherwise a lot of the characters presented have some interesting stories to them. As well as the post-apocalyptic Earth you find yourself exploring. I would definitely recommend that you read the log entires for the characters and world. While its later explained why things are they way they are, the logs really add that extra punch to the story.- World: The world is pretty open. Its really interesting and changes as the plot progresses. There isn't much you can do like climb the highest building and then jump off it, but its still all very beautiful and feels pretty big.- Soundtrack: Soundtrack is amazing.- Animations: Animations are really great. For those of you who are bothered by crappy animations such as myself, release that anal retention, because they're good.Con:- Combat: Is kind of weird, you can easily lose some enemies in the heat of combat. And the targeting system is pretty frantic. Say you want to focus fire on one enemy, expect the lock on to start jumping to other enemies close by. But this will usually be a problem in most games, because its kind of impossible to really select one enemy in a crowd to focus fire. As much as it seems to be a problem it really isn't.- Enemies: The enemies are carbon copies of each other with just some different adages, but seeing how the plot really fans out this makes a lot of sense, especially given the area they are in. So for example the desert bots have tribal clothing on, rather than the city ruins bots, which are the blank slates. (Note: Bosses are very much different, with only one being reused a few times.)- Presentation: Its a japanese game so it makes sense that it feels this way, but there are a lot of moments that feel stupidly anime. Just a plug for people who hate that stuff, but getting this game you should already expect that. Not much of a problem just letting you know.-  World: The world unfortunately does not change as much as most would like. Be warned that a lot of what happens story wise doesn't really effect the world all that much.- Cutscenes: A lot of the game uses in house rendering, which has caused isssues for me when audio desyncd. Be warned about that. Its more of a preformance issue, so if you meet the recommended reqs you shouldn't be experiencing this. However if you run a GTX 970 such as myself, you may run into this issue.- Graphics: If you have a GTX 970, you can play on high graphics and get all that goodness, just set anti aliasing off and turn vsync off as well. The fullscreen is a bit broken so I recommend sticking to windowed and getting an application that forces window borderless, until these issues are fixed.- Endings: This game does not have 26 endings. It has 26 possible ways of ""ending"" the game, i.e. like techincally dying in any game could be considered an ending because the hero is dead. However, there are the A B C D and E plots. I won't go into detail with those, but they are the true endings to the game. As for the other ""endings"" sorry to say, but they aren't groundbreaking, as they were not meant to be. A lot of them are jokes and are actually pretty funny.Conclusion:Thats about all I can think up for this game. Its fun and exciting, and the story is very engaging and shocking. I personally love the characters and how everything fans out.TLDR; Any game that can stop me from playing Overwatch for more than a day is a damn fine game. Take that as you will, but I love Overwatch. Also the game is just really good, play it what are you doing with yourself, nothing, thats what. You're reading reviews, just buy it and play it. Go spend your money.Side Note: For the very few of you who care, 2B is a strong independent woman who don't need no man. Its often 9S who needs to be saved by her. She isn't a pathetic weak girl who whines about everything. Very mission oriented and of course has a nice butt.Personal Note: You're absolutely insane if you think this is a mouse and keyboard game. Just stop right now and don't even bother. If you don't have a controller don't bother. If you complain about how it controls with a mouse and keyboard seek help immediately because there is something wrong with your mental state.More Notes!!: A lot of people are having problems running the game, I have yet to experience these issues. So do some research and approach with caution. Its a great game, but if your hardware can't handle it don't get it. The recommended and the minimum are there for a reason and some people choose to ignore it.			"

												Fantastic game so far, great music, looks good and interesting world.However, level design is a little boring for some of the more open areas and the port is mediocre. Could really use  some more graphics options, optimisation and fullscreen 1080p to not be upscaled, requiring the use of third party software for fullscreen (borderless windowed) 1080p.All in all, worth a buy if you're willing to spend a coupld of minutes to get it in fullscreen.

Bullet Hell, Action-RPG, and Booty, all in one fine-tuned ""Package""... but you're probably here to worship dat ♥♥♥.So before I talk about how great this game is, let me complain about THIS GAME IS HARD.I personally died 8 times in the tutorial section trying to play the game on hard mode (Not doing the harder difficulty... ♥♥♥♥ that). It hurt my pride so hard, I switched to easy mode, and then nothing could touch me. Then my pride hurt even more. If it weren't for that amazing soundtrack, I would have probably ragequit the game for a month.NieR: Automata is about a couple of androids created by humans to take back the world from some alien invasion. While playing the game, you are introduced to 3 different perspectives in combat that blend with each other. Traditional shooter, all-range shooter, and a third person action perspective. Each mode has an almost seamless transition between one another. You have access to all of your weapons and abilities within all 3 perspectives (weak attack, strong attack, gun, special attack?), however gun aiming mechanics differ between the shooter and third person action perspectives.The music is fantastic, the world is almost barren, and there are many weapons, chips, and upgrades to obtain in the game (You can even remove some features like being able to see how much damage you deal, UI elements). Learning from my mishaps in tutorial mode, I now understand if you want to survive in the hard difficulties, you better always be ready to tap that RT button (default). Tap dodge, tap dodge, tap dodge...Performance is... Great, but not perfect. On my gaming rig of an i7 4790K and a GTX 1080, I was able to achieve my ideal quality of 1440p 60fps with the settings on max (turned AA to 2x). The game for the most part kept the 60fps, however I did notice a few minor frame dips every now and then. Resource usage looked normal and does need a beefy GPU to keep within good frames. Oh, but a minor complaint of mine: Cutscenes seem to be locked at 30fps.As someone who has never played the original Nier (however I have played Drakengard 1 and 2), I like this game. The soundtrack was literally the only thing that prevented me from ragequitting during my frustrations with tutorial mode. It's going to be an abusive relationship of me dying over and over again in a hard difficulty, but I'll carry on...  for that booty.  "

												A Nier game from Platinum? After playing this on the PS4 and then moving onto the PC, I guess I'm a skeleton trapped onto the Yoko Taro Wild Ride.The Good:- Characterisation. 2b and 9s are relatively charming along with the supporting cast. The enemies while repetitive and robotic clones of each other have their many quirks.- Combat. Infinitely better than the predecessor because Platinum know how to do combat. And Fishing. And the other side jobs.- The mechanics. Majority Action RPG, part platformer and shoot 'em up. The blend works.- That soundtrack. It helps to set the feelings trip up.- The previous game has no real hold over this one so it's easy to pick up and just play.The Bad:- The open world. So much of it is walled off and quite damn bland which is a shame. Lush areas are met with general buildings and environments that look the damn same. - Resolution and optimisation. I'm running the game on recommended spec and am experiencing frame rate loss. Could just be a driver issue but I've seen the complaints about 4k and Radeon optimisation. Hopefully it'll get quashed now it's in world.-Denuvo. Just no.The mixed.- Complete Emotional Rollercoaster. It helps to be either an emotional masochist or emotionless robot on a Yoko Taro game.- The timesink. It's real in this game and in a way part of the charm that sticks around from the first game. Endlessly replayable and if you're a casual gamer you're not going to get too much out of it from playing a little. Like Police Squad got cancelled, this is one that requires your attention if you want to get invested into it.In Summary.Former Radio 1 DJ John Peel used to operate a five star rating system and he took it to beyond 25 stars for his beloved song by the Undertones, Teenage Kicks. Do I recommend it? Yes. Yes. Emphatically like a Daniel Bryan chant.			"

												In general guidelines I do recommend this title.  The only issue I had at launch was the full screen issue but it was an easy fix it took 2 minutes and had no problem playing at 1080p at all and got first ending around 10.5 hours of gameplay.Negative stuff; there were some stutter issues but nothing that you don't find while playing a console game.  The other part is the game itself, the characters seem to have anxiety and depression issues.  I would say recall this game as Emo Automata.  The battle elements were enjoyable though.			"

												Pros:- Great Combat system very fast paced, fluid and responsive I found myself amazed how fast i can react, dodge and counter-attack.- Story so far has been great about 8 hours in.- Amazing Music have not heard such great music in a game in quite awhile.- Better graphics than ps4 pro but at the same time it is one of the cons below.Cons:- Map could use some work it is easy to get lost.- Chip system is good( but not in death see below) for this type of game but again UI could be better to organize them better and not guess where they could fit in. Some early chips could use some work such as 2% move speed sounds pretty useless until you do upgrades.- DIfficulty i found normal to be good without much gear and chips but once i got a bunch game became too easy but switching to hard proved to be great but then I ended up being faced with the death issue in this game.- Death in this game is kind of like dark souls which by itself would be fine if i just lost all of my exp or money but the issue lies in losing all your chips which i spent all the 8 hours of the game collecting so i end up playing on nromal which tends to make the game too easy.- Camera angles in some situations are pretty bad especially on the side 2d view i tend to lose track of my character as it it becomes pretty small on screen and the companion looks too much the same so I end up confusing which one is me.- Graphics wise it is a pretty poor port as i end up running the game on 1440p@60 on gtx 1080 on max setting which is still a lot better than ps4 pro but most games i can run at 4k@60 with minor adjustments with better graphics than this game and the locked 60fps is really a shame as i think this game would really benefit @120fps because of the super fast action pace.Conclusion:I would really give this game a 10/10 if all of the cons were not in this initial release but for now i think it is a solid 8/10.

												I don't see any issues regarding the perfomance.I'm using a Sapphire R9 390 Nitro, an i7 5820k and 16 Gigs of 2333Mhz Ram.The only ""issue"" i see is the 30 fps (lock) during Cutscenes?I'm playing with maxed out settings at FullHD and im always at 60 FPS.It's gameplaywise something new for me, i'm usually not a ""god of war""-esque game player, im from the Dark Souls Camp so playing a (button masher?) is an entire new genre for me since i skipped everything, from DMC to God of War and even the first Nier Game.I thought why not, give it a try, and yeah, 2B is 100% Waifu Material, we all have to admit that.I'm only 2 Hours in but i don't feel bored yet, wich is a rare case.Hard mode was a little bit too hard for me, so after one hour of trying to beat the prologue - you have to pass the prologue to save your game, i had to restart everything from the beginning several times - i choose to switch to the normal difficulty, it's more enyojable for me.

												I have been enjoying this game without issue thus far. The gameplay is very fun and fluid. The graphics are pretty and the soundtrack to the game is wonderful. I've been running the game in fullscreen at max settings at 1920x1080. The framerate has been at 60fps completely thoughout my experience, with several drops to 30fps at some cutscenes which I believe to be intentional. The controls on the keyboard and mouse are more than fine and better than I had anticipated. I would probably recommend trying the game on a controller to see which you prefer. I would recommend this game on the premise that you enjoy the genre. I don't know if I would recommend this purely on the story yet, as I have not completed it.CPU: i7-4770kGPU: GTX 1060 6GBOS: Windows 10			"

												5h into the game, no crashes, no lags, no performance issues. Everything runs smoothly at max settings. Kinda sad its capped at 60fps tho.Gameplay is super fun and smooth as butter. There's no auto save but if you don't start your first playthrough on hardcore there is absolutely no issue getting to save points every few minutes. I don't understand how people can die in the prologue, crying about having to replay that is pretty pathetic tbh.The soundtrack is simply amazing in this game and all the effects are fitting too.So far, pure enjoyment from this game.

												So far, after about 6.4 hours of gameplay, this is my thinking on the game.As a whole, the game is absolutely gorgeous, great graphics, although there are some weird ""artifacts"" sometime, and they are not the top of the art, but the feel you get when roaming in the various places is overwhelming, so this is enough for me to count them as great, the soundtrack is perfect, great collection of music, that fits the game atmosphere perfectly, and the idea of mixing shoot'em'up and hack'n'slash is just brillant, and works flawlessly. Storywise, I've liked it so far, and the dark atmosphere of the whole universe is really well rendered.Now on the the negative points, because yes, although it is overall great, there are a couple of things to be improved.30fps locked cut scenes are a bit of a let down compared to the rest of the 60 fps rendered game, and the game fullscreen is being kinda,... capricious. Ok true, I have a 21:9 screen as main monitor and not many games are quite friendly with superwide screen ratios. So it took me a bit of fiddling with the screen res and switching windowed/fullscreen, but it is now settled to a cosy 2560x1080 fullscreen.That aside, the games run smoothly at 60fps, on a 6GB GTX 1070, with best possible graphic settings.Shortly, the game was completely worth buying for me, great gameplay, although the mix of shoot'em'up/bullet hell and hack'n'slash might not be to the taste of all, gorgeous graphics that fits the atmosphere perfectly, all that packaged with a flawless soundtrack.So if you can make-do with the little technical issues mentionned above, NieR : Automata is a game that should definetly get added to your collection.

												TLDR:Gameplay: 10/10 it's fun, solid controls. Action packed. Great stuff.Audio: 10/10 best soundtrack of the year. The voice acting sounds good. Etc etc.Visuals: 7/10 game looks good. Nothing amazing nothing bad either.Seems like a solid game. Performance has been great. Game has been fun. I played for an hour and have to go to work. I don't want to go to work. Gah.Ok. So obviously I like the game: you guys are for some reason not buying the game and need me to tell you why to buy it. I get it, $60 is preposterous and you can't make up your own opinion in 2 hours and refund if needed so below tells you why to buy it.Gameplay: Solid control. Responsive controls. I'm using xbox1 controller by the way. These are must haves because this game is quick with loads of action. Mind you I'm playing in normal and it isn't overly hard which is great. Always my fear that these action games can be too hard and demanding which means I can't play it. (Harder modes are definitely harder, I tried haha)So aside from the great controls the actual style of gameplay is fantastic. Seamlessly going from top down shooter, side scroller/platformer third person fee camera styles and more, each style plays similar but different and I love it. Really keeps you engaged.I was playing in top down, got knocked back into a side room and the camera seamlessly follows switching perspectives. Some big robot was in there so I kick his ♥♥♥ through the door, changing perspectives and proceeding to continue my battle. It's really thrilling and needs tried not explained.Audio: English and Japanese voice acting. I tried both. Both sound good. Always a fear the English sounds incredibly cheesy and fake. The soundtracks in the game are hands down ♥♥♥♥ing awesome.Visuals: nothing fancy nothing bad. Looks better than the trailers by a good amount though. I cranked aliasing textures and postprocessing to max. Off by default. I use sli 1080 it's probably only using 1 but meh. Most games don't support sli.Performance has been great. No slowdowns. Like I mentioned I turned aliasing and other things all the way up. Looks much better than the trailers.The game is much better than wildlands and for honor and some of the other ""big"" games out right now. Try it for yourself.

												Nier Automata is a superb action game with a very interesting story that manages to bring up a load of philosophical questions without being too vague in what it has to say. But still leaving a lot for the player to think about.  The world building is really amazing and I think anyone who passes this game perhaps because they don't usually like Japanese games or RPGs is making a mistake.   The game does not require you to play the previous Nier(2010) as the story is pretty much unrelated, however if you have played it you will find a chunk of references and stuff you will recognize from it.   I think the game strikes a perfect balance with introducing elements, progressing the story and opening up the world for you. After an excellent introductory action packed section you're put in to the open world, if you're just interested in playing through the story and not do side quests or exploring running to the main objectives shouldn't take too long and you're never forced to do any tedious grinding of any kind unless you're thinking about 100% every item and side quest.   If you're playing this DO NOT STOP PLAYING AFTER ENDING A. You're not even halfway through the story at that point. I think its a bit misleading to call them ""endings"" as it really is more like different chapters, and the only part you are gonna be ""replaying"" is done from a different perspective from the first time with additional story elements revealed. After that everything will be new.   The fighting in this game is amazing, its incredibly intuitive when you're new and fun from the get go but also has a lot of depths as you discover combos or how equipping different weapons can affect how you attack, you can have two weapons equipped at a time and these weapons can change how you attack with both of them. For example equipping a heavy sword and spear you can do a cool move where you stick the spear in the ground and hold on to it then spin around it swinging the sword. Everything is really fast and fluid and since doing an action always cancels out whatever you're doing you always feel 100% in control.   Movement and dodging (or dashing?) feels wonderful to be honest. Even just running around is fun and exploring any of the areas in the game is just a blast, whether parkouring around the buildings in the city or sliding down sand dunes in the desert. Also it compliments the combat beautifully.   Beyond that you can equip different computer chips that can have varying affects. You get a certain amount of slots you can fill out, different chips take out different amount of slots. If you want to boost your damage you can fill out your slots with damage boosting chips and perhaps a couple to increase your chance of critical. If you value speed and dodging you can equip chips to boost movement and your dodging distance. Perhaps you like to go all in and go for a tanky hard headed approach, boost your damage and install a chip that will heal you X amount of what you deal out to your enemies. Combined with the different weapons you can really make something fun that you will enjoy. It's impressive how much variation you can get out of it.You also have your ""pod"" hovering above you which you can use to either shoot or unleash a special attack move or other function depending on what you put in it, different ones can be equipped and they all vary quite a bit with incredibly cool effects.Certain area's of the game switches up camera perspective and gamestyle. There are some parts that played with a side scrolling perspective and some where you're seeing things from a topdown perspective. These transitions are smooth as all heck and keeps the game interesting.   Overall design is beautiful both visually and the game design. The bosses are creative and fun and the many different enemy types that really keeps things interesting. Some ""bullet hell"" sections are just incredibly intense and really gets your heart pumping.   With that said there are some technical issues present on the pc version, however they should be fixable with mods if it hasn't been patched by the time you're reading this.   Ive probably forgotten to say most things I wanted to say about this game. But Its amazing. I usually have to force myself to finish a game, but this one I really have to force myself to stop playing instead.			"

												This is the sort of game that comes along once a decade if we're lucky. Yoko Taro and the team at Platinum have managed to create a work of art that pushes the boundaries of narrative in a videogame. It is representative of absolute mastery of the medium.I won't delve into the story here, since I think it would be best experienced as blind as possible, but suffice it to say that I found the story compelling, nuanced, and interesting. Characters are well written and deep. There's some minor dissonance in tone from sentence to sentence and mission to mission, but overall, I can forgive those minor quibbles very easily in the face of such an ambitious story being pulled off, by and large, very well. For players who played Drakengard and NieR, there's a lot of tie ins and easter eggs and such, but it's perfectly possible to enjoy without that background.In terms of gameplay, this is a hybrid of the best of Platinum spectacle fighter, bullet hell schmup, and JRPG. The primary combat is fantastic spectacle fighting with great depth of combos, excellent responsiveness on the controls, flexibility of approach, and tons of room to gain mastery and skill. The game often limits your perspective to a certain camera angle, so sometimes it's a sidescroller or a top down beat em up, or a few other things, which further adds variety to the combat - though I did find it tough to time jump dodges in the top down perspective in the early game. I found myself kinda missing the scoring system that is often present on Platinum games as a utility for self evaluation of performance, but I can live without it given it's not primarily a combat game, and there's plenty of feedback for how you're doing in other ways, such as the Very Hard difficulty, which reduces your health to a simple one-hit-death - if you can survive there, you've mastered it. I'm still working on it, but I'll get there, and I can't wait, because this combat is super satisfying. The animations and weapon variety contribute greatly to the satisfaction to be found in this combat - everything your character does looks slick as hell, and it feels ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic to pull off a perfect kill or to wipe a boss with just a sliver of health left, or anywhere in between. Outside of combat, the gameplay consists of a semi-open overworld filled with interesting locations, gorgeous vistas, and compelling characters with many sidequests. Many of the side quests amount to little more than basic fetch quests - but I find that I didn't mind that because the combat was so compelling and I like the world, so the thin justification (""get me a pristine screw and three complex gadgets"") for most of the quests were easy to ignore. As an additional form of combat, there are the flight/hacking segments, which present as a top-down shoot-em-up bullet hell game. The controls are tight, and the mechanics are clean. However, I feel like the hacking overstayed it's welcome a bit - you spend a lot of time solving the same hacking puzzles because there's not enough, and I'd like to see a little more mechanical variation. Still, it's solid and satisfying - it just doesn't match the polish of the primary combat system.The soundtrack is peerless - a true 10/10. Each track perfectly matches it's location/scene and is masterfully rendered. I'm not sure if they're digitally created or a full symphony, but either way, they did a hell of a job. Will be getting it on disc the second it's available.Unfortunately, this PC port is lackluster. As released, it has issues with setting resolution properly in fullscreen mode, and has relatively poor performance on anything but high end machines with modern graphics cards. Fortunately, enterprising community members have fixed most of these issues: Kaldaien's FAR patch and DrDaxxy's Global Illumination fix are must haves at this point. Keyboard+mouse controls are apparently also garbage, but I played on controller. Hopefully platinum releases a patch, but even if they don't it's worth fixing it yourself and playing it anyway. For what it's worth, I played it on a 4790k/980ti at 1440p and it was playable without those fixes, but they definitely helped lock the framerate. ~40 of my 50 hours (as I write this) were with the fixes, and I had no crashes or problems in that time.Overall, I cannot recommend this game enough. It has issues, to be sure - nothing is perfect - but the amount they set out to achieve here was simply immense, and they nailed 97% of it. I won't say it's for everyone, and I'm sure there's people who will ragequit the tutorial and never want more - but those people will have missed a masterpiece. And I think everyone should try it, because if it speaks to you the way it did to me, it's a borderline religious experience, a game I won't ever forget, that's made me think about things in ways I hadn't before, made me laugh, made me cry, made me actually feel something, from 'cover to cover.'To quote the great Jim Sterling on the matter, ""If history forgets this game, then ♥♥♥♥ history.""And I can't stop thinking about how much I want to **** 2B.

												NOTE: I AM A KEYBOARD/MOUSE PLAYER! My experience is DRASTICALLY different than those with a gamepad.EDIT#2: I bought a Controller (using an old 360 controller I found) and it's DRASTICALLY different. It is by far flawless now. Never going back. Still keeping my below post for future keyboard ventures. IF YOU WILL BUY THIS GAME AND DON'T HAVE A POTATO FOR A PC GET A CONTROL PLEASE YOU WILL LOVE ME FOR IT. DOUBLE TAP TO DODGE NEVER WORKS IN ANY GAME SINCE EVER. K i'm done back to playing Automata.Absolutely love this game. Flight missions area bit weird on keyboard but everything else is fantastic! To elaborate better; unless you lower the sensitivity to your mouse, expect to use the arrow keys for aiming. While this isn't much of an issue, I, personally, feel awkward using heavy attacks on \ key.FOR ME (as I am aware there's a lot of steam kids with potato computers crying No to recommendations), I have absolutely zero issues with this game loading and playing. I play max graphics, a MSI GTX 970 Graphics card i've had for years and have no had issues.I've even streamed my first four hours on twitch and it was smooth as silk. So I do not agree with everyone's negative vote when we were well informed about the things at hand.I DO feel there is a bug (or rather lack thereof) of a true Full screen mode. You can get full screen, but if you ever tab out you'll go right back to windows. For me, that is an issue mainly because I have to tab out to reply to viewers as well as my NeiR/Drakengard Discord and various messages on Skype. I would love for that to just stay in place. That'd be awesome.I do not like double taps to dodge. I never have in any mmo since ever. I much prefer the choice of hitting a key and pushing a direction in order to dodge in a direction. It's far more responsive and effective whereas double tap universally does not regester all the time.ALL IN ALL; This game is still great. Combat is fresh and fast and hold a challanging aspect to it that keeps my interest. I am a diehard Drakengard/NieR fan since 2003 so OF COURSE I am going to be extremely bias. I am use to much worse in a game I love (serious. Go play Drakengard 1 and then tell me NieR has loads of issues. This is gold in comparison.)10/10 would NieR again. Despite minor issues from me, I still love this game and will continue to push towards 100%, sacrifice my data, engage with my fandom in my discord and continue to play. To the people who are downvoting PURELY because they're crying about their horrible FPS, please. Do yourself a favor and buy a new graphics card before you ♥♥♥♥ on a game. It's your fault you have a potato. That is all.			"

												An early review of the game with 7 hours in.The good:- Great combat, very fluid 60fps when fighting.- Very weird, in a good way.- It's basically Metal Gear Rising 2.  I consider this a huge plus.The bad:- Something is wrong with the resolution at fullscreen.  It's upscaling or something weird like that.- Some cutscenes run at maybe 20 fps?  It's very odd.  Everything else is fine.- Game crashed on me when trying to quit.The awkward:- Character gets out of bed.  Full frontal panty shot.- Character runs.  Constant panty shots with every step.- Character gets knocked down.  Can you guess what happens?			"

												So far I'm only getting stuttering/FPS drops during cutscenes.  And they are MASSIVE.  BUTTTTT, gameplay however is smooth and stable at 60fps.  If they don't fix the problems soon though, then I will take back my recommendation.I'm actually enjoying the game.  It's not often that we have save points over auto save these days.  Not to mention the bossfights can be challenging so I sense I'll be cursing some bosses for having to start back from my last save point again.My Specs:EVGA GTX 1070 SCIntel i5 4690k @ 3.9ghz16GB Ripjaws RAM250gb Intel SSD (For OS)960 GB SanDisk SSD (for Games and other programs)1 TB HDD (For Personal Projects/Unimportant programs) "

												Well, at first I was afraid how the port would end up as, but my PC ended up running everything on max (I did took Anti-Alias down to 2x though), FX 8520E and R9 380 2G, so quite a surprise, also no problems, I do am running in Windowed mode with Borderless Gaming though, like I usually do.The only con is that, besides some frame drops that basically slow down the game, which I prefer over frame skip, cutscenes are 30fps, so you are playing, all game events doing very nice, then you end up in a cutscene that feels like frameskipping...Anyway, not ultra realistic, you can see the simpleness on NPCs, but as expected, it's looking great.PS: Between the Valve exclusive and the PlaySystem Pod exclusive on the Potato 4, Valve's is just so much better. So nice seeing that red valve on 2B's head.			"

Pros:- Amazingly Fluid Combat that both feels good and is good.- Great soundtrack- Great Story with lots of twists.Cons:- Pre-rendered cutscenes that run at 900p 30fps- 4k ""Support""- Sorta: Can be short if runned through quickly. i finished the 1st Arc in 7 Hours, although i hadn't done Half of the sidequests and there are still 2 other Arcs to goTldr;    This is a great game that is played by Console Port Syndrome, hopefully can be fixed as time goes on, however as is it is a great experience that i'm sure to play more.

												I was really itching for a good hack and slash game with a good story. This game is it. If you like Platinum Games - they've done a fantastic job in this one for combat. The story is really weird and the whole game world is really interesting. It's pretty engaging. I've read that there are multiple endings and you have to play through it multiple times. That being said, I'm on my first playthrough and it's been a blast.I play on a Laptop with GTX970M graphics, i7-5700HQ and 16 GB ram. Initial issues include: the game running pretty slowly. You'll likely have to get borderless window to make it run smoother on 1080p. I also had to manually set this program to use my graphics card (in NVIDIA control panel). After those small fixes - it's been really awesome.			"

												NieR: Automata, where to begin. This game is a love child born between Yoko Taro's genius storytelling and the slick and refined action of Platinum Games (Bayonetta, Metal Gear Rising).Having already spent 50+ hours on the PS4 version and experienced all the endings; it is an incredible game, a masterpiece in fact. This is Yoko Taro's best game as of yet, and I am happy to re-purchase to support this game even more, as it deserves all the sales it can get. This is probably a game I will play from start to finish, time and time again.Although an entry to the Drakengard/Nier franchise, this game is completely enjoyable without any knowledge of previous entries to the series, although fans of Yoko Taro's games will be rewarded. It is so nice to finally see a game from this franchise on PC, and there is talk of a Drakengard collection to follow (if Square Enix funds it).Automata combines slick and satisfying combat with a distinctly unique and gripping narrative. This is coupled with intriguing open world to explore and one of the best game soundtracks of all time. My only words of advice is that to experience this game in its entirety, you must play new game+. Unlike other titles; new game+ is woven into the core of this game. After rushing through the initial campaign in little over 10 hours, I was quite shocked at an abrupt ending. Little did I know this was merely a prologue of what was to come.Yoko Taro uses the gaming medium to its fullest potential, delivering a storytelling experience which is strikingly unique, and will blow your mind.Lastly, give it time; this one gets better the more you play.Story 10/10Graphics 8/10Gameplay 9/10Soundtrack 10/10Overall 10/10TL;DROne of/if not favourite game of all time;You're in for a ride.

												Just a quick early review that I'll probably update later:Working well I guess, solid 60fps at 1080p although it's a bit weird like its set to 1080p but it's not really 1080p so its like I dunno apparently there's some glitch where it's not native 1080 in full screen or something but whatever I'm sure it'll be fixed. Unfortunately the framerate is locked at 30fps on the cutscenes, however its locked at 60 everywhere else so that's good enough. Not many graphics options, doubt the game looks any better on PC than on PS4. Keyboard and mouse controls are alright but does seem like a game that would be a lot easier with a controller. So far I'd say its a decent enough port but ya know I'm not trying to play at 4k or 144hz so I can't speak for some but good enough for me.			"

												In general guidelines I do recommend this title.  The only issue I had at launch was the full screen issue but it was an easy fix it took 2 minutes and had no problem playing at 1080p at all and got first ending around 10.5 hours of gameplay.Negative stuff; there were some stutter issues but nothing that you don't find while playing a console game.  The other part is the game itself, the characters seem to have anxiety and depression issues.  I would say recall this game as Emo Automata.  The battle elements were enjoyable though.			"

												A Nier game from Platinum? After playing this on the PS4 and then moving onto the PC, I guess I'm a skeleton trapped onto the Yoko Taro Wild Ride.The Good:- Characterisation. 2b and 9s are relatively charming along with the supporting cast. The enemies while repetitive and robotic clones of each other have their many quirks.- Combat. Infinitely better than the predecessor because Platinum know how to do combat. And Fishing. And the other side jobs.- The mechanics. Majority Action RPG, part platformer and shoot 'em up. The blend works.- That soundtrack. It helps to set the feelings trip up.- The previous game has no real hold over this one so it's easy to pick up and just play.The Bad:- The open world. So much of it is walled off and quite damn bland which is a shame. Lush areas are met with general buildings and environments that look the damn same. - Resolution and optimisation. I'm running the game on recommended spec and am experiencing frame rate loss. Could just be a driver issue but I've seen the complaints about 4k and Radeon optimisation. Hopefully it'll get quashed now it's in world.-Denuvo. Just no.The mixed.- Complete Emotional Rollercoaster. It helps to be either an emotional masochist or emotionless robot on a Yoko Taro game.- The timesink. It's real in this game and in a way part of the charm that sticks around from the first game. Endlessly replayable and if you're a casual gamer you're not going to get too much out of it from playing a little. Like Police Squad got cancelled, this is one that requires your attention if you want to get invested into it.In Summary.Former Radio 1 DJ John Peel used to operate a five star rating system and he took it to beyond 25 stars for his beloved song by the Undertones, Teenage Kicks. Do I recommend it? Yes. Yes. Emphatically like a Daniel Bryan chant.			"

												This game was an experience, a little fan servicey at times but all around had me yelling ""Holy ♥♥♥♥!"" most of the time, you can just pass over the enemies most of the time and the textures make it so that every thing looks blended together and it kind of hurts the eyes. The boss fights were all around pheonominal, even if i didn't have to move and just hold right bumper most of the time, i only did one play through of this game and i feel it didn't deserve the praise a lot of people have given it.  Not saying it's a bad game, but certainly lacks a certain polish. The story was compelling, making me want to get to the next story checkpoint after another, i was never really compelled to do any side quests. I saw no use, the only use for the other weapons was you would use whichever weapon you could upgrade. I do not regret this purchase but feel a smaller price tag would have made it more worth it. If i were to give it a meta critic score, i would give it a 7/10.			"

I am getting 40-60fps at 1440p custom ultra-medium settings with my i7 4770k + outdated GTX 780 so I am not gonna complain about my performace. Combat - Fluid and quite enjoyable once you understand the basics.Sound - I LOVE the soundtracks! They are very well composed and unique for the moods. I cant wait for them to be released for purchase.Upgrade system - You have to buy chips to upgrade you system and each chip uses a specific number of slots so you have to be careful the way you upgrade ur system chips.Gameplay and Story - So far very enjoyable, no complaints from me in this regards. Only thing is how the game will dynamically change from 3rd person to isometric view and make your movements feel very restricted. P.S - Oh I gotta tell you that you will be staring at an upskirt buttock for most part of the game and appreciate the beatuy! :3 Its not revealing enough to loose interest after some time - it just gives u the right amout of visual to keep u intersted on the butto---- ~cough cough~ the mission I mean.If you like hack and slash adventure game - try this by all means, you wont regreat.

I've been amazed and immersed on a completely different level than what I'd ever anticipate. Everything from the smooth, flowing combat and the deep, emotional - and also a bit weird - story to the fantastic musical score which apparently is made in a completely unique language solely made for the NieR universe. If that isn't just an amazing level of commitment and hard work then I don't know what is.Boss battles with several, widely varied phases which has to gripped tight in suspense all the time, hordes of minions to satisfyingly hack and slash through has had me more immersed than I'd ever hoped to be, and I was very excited for this game! It certainly hasn't disappointed, contrary to recent trend. I guess the only complaint I'd have is that many of the fights are very long, and in several phases, and there aren't any autosaves inbetween, so if you're playing on Hard or Very Hard it can be frustrating having to redo such long segments if you mess up.-Story-Storywise I'd say that there are some bits that you'd have much greater understanding of and that would give you much more enjoyment if you've experienced the prior games in the Drakengard/NieR series. Nothing gamebreaking, but you'd certainly miss out on the complete experience if you're going into this game without any prior knowledge of its universe and history.-Graphics-Many complain about this game having very high requirements in order to play at the highest graphic settings, and I have to agree that there has been a couple of hick-ups even on my GTX1060. Not many, as I've been able to play through the game almost consistently at 60 fps with everything maxed out. The graphics aren't the greatest in comparison to other high-end games like this, they're not the worst either. I'd compare them maybe to the new Hitman game but with a bit more desaturated color scheme. However, t even looks good in nVidia 3D vision, even if there are quite some shadow artifacts and other bugs. However, the community is working on 3D patches already, so hopefully a smooth 3D experience isn't far away.-Music-Once again...wow. Many times I just revisit zones to listen to the music. The soundtrack to this game is fantastic! It's a really enjoyable surprise that even the language is made specifically for these games which adds another dimension of amazement to something already very enjoyable! I think I've so far spent the most time in the Bunker. That music is just so soothing and peaceful. Once again I have to say that there are quite some references to earlier games even among the musical scores which will be even more enjoyable if you've gone through the predecessor games.-Combat-Flashy combos all day every day! That's pretty much the majority of it. The ability to combine different weapon types in various constellations as well as switching between two custom made weapon sets on the go really makes for some amazingly satisfying combos and attacks. Paired up with the pods various attack modes and programs makes the whole experience breathtaking. The major downside would be the camera in my opinion. It can be a bit finnicky, at least when playing with a controller, and often pan around or do things on its own which can often lead to obstructed views when you're in the heat of battle. I gave up locking onto enemies quite early since it more often than not would mess around with my camera and be more in the way than helpfull.I've played quite a few hack and slash games in my time and the feeling of smoothness of the combat here was very reminiscent of such pure action games. But not only that, you've also got your top-down spaceshooter and elements of bullet hell/touhou games, and it all just flows together in a smooth way that doesn't feel like an abrupt hindrance of your combat pace but rather a natural step over to the next phase of the fight. It's just amazing.-Difficulty-Many talk about platinum games generally being quite difficult, I don't get that reference. However, I have tried the Normal, Hard and Very Hard difficulties and I have to say that there's a huge gap from Normal to Hard. I don't know if it's heavily reliant on you keeping up with leveling between story quests or grinding to be in phase with the story quest difficulty, but Normal always felt very easy. The enemies do barely any damage, only the bosses does significant amounts of damage, which is easy mitigated with the right chip loadouts. Then we get to Hard. You do somewhat less damage to enemies, either that or they just have higher defenses, but they do truckloads of more damage to you. Very Hard is supposed to be a one-shot mode, that you can't even take one, single hit without dying, but many times Hard has been essentially the same as many attacks still one-shots you on that difficulty. I remember one, specific fight where the enemy projectiles did around 80% of my HP in damage, and they staggered me for a short while as well, so taking 1 projectile almost always meant taking another one, which essentially leads to a one-shot kill.It was quite annoying as I wanted a difficulty somewhere between Normal and Hard to get the most appropriate challenge for my skill level.However, in the post-game, when you've perfected yourself, even Very Hard isn't so daunting. But when on your first playthrough through the main game, it's quite the challenge!Man...what a great game.			"

												Just finished the game, got the endings A K W from 1 play through. Apparently multiple routes you can take, I think A is probably best ending but still leaves many answers unanswered. The design and everything is generally very engaging and definately will entice you to replay the game multiple times for different endings! The characters (especially 2B) is really likable from my experience. The music is simply outstanding. The artstyle is very unique and lovely, as long as you are okay with most of the game being in a ruined city greyish (there are 3 sections with different themes that I encountered so far from 1 play through).For my more technical thoughts see below.This game is pretty awesome, however if you do not have a controller don't expect to enjoy it as much with Mouse and Keyboard. You cannot dodge the same way you can with a controller with KB+M due to no dedicated button for evasion. Also the visuals on wide screen is kind of strange during cutscenes (probably stretched slightly or something), and there aren't many graphical customizations other than low medium and high. If you do not meet the minimum requirements for the specs you may find quite a few problems with the fps according to the community.Required:Specs to meet the game min.Controller for more enjoyment.Borderless gaming program for best resolution + borderless full screenPro:Game play is quite funVisuals is beautiful if not hindered by some glitches with the resolution at times switching to 720p for no reason. (Only in full screen.)Has Japanese voice/ English voice. Japanese voice is far superior (and the protagonist simply has a very likeable Jap voice)Cons:M+KB doesn't play that well in certain views (game switches from FPS/TPS/Top down/ many other)Cannot rebind evasion, cannot make Shift a toggle for shootingSome glitches and bugs (will probably be ironed out by the community)Cinematics are low fps and sometimes sutter for me (even though I have really high spec pc, however I use a 3440x1440 monitor)No borderless fullscreen. If you minimize at times you might be stuck with a mouse cursor on the screen so you need to save and restart the game to get rid of it... However there is no autosave. And you must find save points. Not to mention sometimes after minimizing your game is stuck in window mode. And if you are stuck in a cutscene you cannot change it back to full screen until you regain control of the game. Well you are stuck with watching those emotional/beautiful cutscenes in windowed mode with stutter and a mouse cursor in the middle if that happens to you (happened to me), unless you want to replay the whole section, since there is no auto save... (this can all be fixed by borderless gaming)			"

												NOTE: I AM A KEYBOARD/MOUSE PLAYER! My experience is DRASTICALLY different than those with a gamepad.EDIT#2: I bought a Controller (using an old 360 controller I found) and it's DRASTICALLY different. It is by far flawless now. Never going back. Still keeping my below post for future keyboard ventures. IF YOU WILL BUY THIS GAME AND DON'T HAVE A POTATO FOR A PC GET A CONTROL PLEASE YOU WILL LOVE ME FOR IT. DOUBLE TAP TO DODGE NEVER WORKS IN ANY GAME SINCE EVER. K i'm done back to playing Automata.Absolutely love this game. Flight missions area bit weird on keyboard but everything else is fantastic! To elaborate better; unless you lower the sensitivity to your mouse, expect to use the arrow keys for aiming. While this isn't much of an issue, I, personally, feel awkward using heavy attacks on \ key.FOR ME (as I am aware there's a lot of steam kids with potato computers crying No to recommendations), I have absolutely zero issues with this game loading and playing. I play max graphics, a MSI GTX 970 Graphics card i've had for years and have no had issues.I've even streamed my first four hours on twitch and it was smooth as silk. So I do not agree with everyone's negative vote when we were well informed about the things at hand.I DO feel there is a bug (or rather lack thereof) of a true Full screen mode. You can get full screen, but if you ever tab out you'll go right back to windows. For me, that is an issue mainly because I have to tab out to reply to viewers as well as my NeiR/Drakengard Discord and various messages on Skype. I would love for that to just stay in place. That'd be awesome.I do not like double taps to dodge. I never have in any mmo since ever. I much prefer the choice of hitting a key and pushing a direction in order to dodge in a direction. It's far more responsive and effective whereas double tap universally does not regester all the time.ALL IN ALL; This game is still great. Combat is fresh and fast and hold a challanging aspect to it that keeps my interest. I am a diehard Drakengard/NieR fan since 2003 so OF COURSE I am going to be extremely bias. I am use to much worse in a game I love (serious. Go play Drakengard 1 and then tell me NieR has loads of issues. This is gold in comparison.)10/10 would NieR again. Despite minor issues from me, I still love this game and will continue to push towards 100%, sacrifice my data, engage with my fandom in my discord and continue to play. To the people who are downvoting PURELY because they're crying about their horrible FPS, please. Do yourself a favor and buy a new graphics card before you ♥♥♥♥ on a game. It's your fault you have a potato. That is all.			"

												This is a review from about 10 hour into the game. Tldr; I reccomend this and rate it a 7/10. The best part of this game is the main characters;  they have the best models and their dialogue is very character defining. They stand out in this game and I find that important in a game that:looks like its many years dated in graphics and whoes side missions and story are very mediocre so far. the combat is a feels great, looks deep and hard kind of system that really doesn't utilize that too much. the skills you get will greatly alter how combat is defined and experience and while it is awesome once you look at it this was not the game I was hoping for, basically something sorta like dark souls. There is a lot of myustery that tugs on many gamers penchant to hold back in item usage but it really doesn't matter at all. I say this for normal mode only where it is still easy to die but only if you dont pay attention... otherwise when you get used to dodging it becomes a much easier game to win with.That said, I do still find the sombat enjoyable and the bland environments are at least interesting enough for me to find interest in exporation. The story is a bit intrigueing but definitely not unique on the slightest sense so far (if you are into sci fi genere works) and there are tales of having to play this game multiple times to find out what is actually going on in the story. Overall I rate this a 7/10 because it doesn't do anything poorly but doesn't seem to excell in any sort of area besides main character immersion.			"

												13 hours played, ~4 year old PC upgraded with a GTX 970. Playing with an XBox 360 controller (worked out of the gate). The only technical issue I ran into was the fullscreen resolution bug, worked around it with windowed mode + Borderless Gaming. Since then everything works flawlessly, excellent framerate (there is the odd 2 second hitch when it loads in new areas). Very good about loading times.Gameplay is a joy to play for the most part. The camera and auto-aim fail at times and some of the finer points of the game's rules are seemingly left for the player to figure out through trial and error. Playing on normal the game is too easy but does feature the odd sudden difficulty spike.What takes it from good fun to remarkable are the setting, melodrama, comedy and weirdness. So far the story has been rather straight forward but I've not yet completed the first ending, so looking forward to more.			"

												Well, I did't get 5 minuttes into the game. Apparently it will not allow me to select my 1070 graphics card and is using my onboard display. I am using a gaming laptop, spent over 2k so its has more than enough power no need in noting all my specs. I stream and play enough games to know it is up to date. I have not been able to enjoy any of the game. It seems to run at a whopping 5 frames per second. However I know it would be 60 if in the settings it would actually allow me to select which video card I want to run the game. I will try to look into this further. If I can't find anything hopefully I will get my 59.99 back. I spent it to be able to play a game that should be able to run on ANY pc that meets the posted requirements, and should have had all its bells and whistles checked before the realease since we had to wait in the first place.I am unhappy, I am still excited to play the game. I would still recommend this game, but with caution, as it looks extreamly fun. I would just like more caution and preparation on the developer end.Edit : To anyone experiencing the same issue,  just go into your nvidia control panel. You will have to manually have the game boot from your Nvidia. Boom, problem solved and enjoy!Edit 2 : I just read some of the license. Why do people complain about this ""Denovo"" it seems permission is granted to modify and do whatever you will so long as you provide the copywright... I havn't written any script in over a decade, never modded a game, but pretty sure someone will add or be able to do something with this.""Condemnation before investigation is the height of ignorance."" - Rob SkibaI've done little research myself on these software that apparently limit gameplay should a developer stop supporting the game. I'm sure they will consider things such as this. If not, I'm sure there is something that can be done with a little effort on our part.Either way, I am having so much fun with this game. The controls are taking a bit of time getting use to, but I will end up playing on very hard. If anyone is interested as well, look me up on twitch. I've only just started however, I am attempting to work in a stream schedule. If you're interested check out  InTheCG.Take care everyone. Hope you are enjoying the gameplay as much as I am.

												Nier Automata is a superb action game with a very interesting story that manages to bring up a load of philosophical questions without being too vague in what it has to say. But still leaving a lot for the player to think about.  The world building is really amazing and I think anyone who passes this game perhaps because they don't usually like Japanese games or RPGs is making a mistake.   The game does not require you to play the previous Nier(2010) as the story is pretty much unrelated, however if you have played it you will find a chunk of references and stuff you will recognize from it.   I think the game strikes a perfect balance with introducing elements, progressing the story and opening up the world for you. After an excellent introductory action packed section you're put in to the open world, if you're just interested in playing through the story and not do side quests or exploring running to the main objectives shouldn't take too long and you're never forced to do any tedious grinding of any kind unless you're thinking about 100% every item and side quest.   If you're playing this DO NOT STOP PLAYING AFTER ENDING A. You're not even halfway through the story at that point. I think its a bit misleading to call them ""endings"" as it really is more like different chapters, and the only part you are gonna be ""replaying"" is done from a different perspective from the first time with additional story elements revealed. After that everything will be new.   The fighting in this game is amazing, its incredibly intuitive when you're new and fun from the get go but also has a lot of depths as you discover combos or how equipping different weapons can affect how you attack, you can have two weapons equipped at a time and these weapons can change how you attack with both of them. For example equipping a heavy sword and spear you can do a cool move where you stick the spear in the ground and hold on to it then spin around it swinging the sword. Everything is really fast and fluid and since doing an action always cancels out whatever you're doing you always feel 100% in control.   Movement and dodging (or dashing?) feels wonderful to be honest. Even just running around is fun and exploring any of the areas in the game is just a blast, whether parkouring around the buildings in the city or sliding down sand dunes in the desert. Also it compliments the combat beautifully.   Beyond that you can equip different computer chips that can have varying affects. You get a certain amount of slots you can fill out, different chips take out different amount of slots. If you want to boost your damage you can fill out your slots with damage boosting chips and perhaps a couple to increase your chance of critical. If you value speed and dodging you can equip chips to boost movement and your dodging distance. Perhaps you like to go all in and go for a tanky hard headed approach, boost your damage and install a chip that will heal you X amount of what you deal out to your enemies. Combined with the different weapons you can really make something fun that you will enjoy. It's impressive how much variation you can get out of it.You also have your ""pod"" hovering above you which you can use to either shoot or unleash a special attack move or other function depending on what you put in it, different ones can be equipped and they all vary quite a bit with incredibly cool effects.Certain area's of the game switches up camera perspective and gamestyle. There are some parts that played with a side scrolling perspective and some where you're seeing things from a topdown perspective. These transitions are smooth as all heck and keeps the game interesting.   Overall design is beautiful both visually and the game design. The bosses are creative and fun and the many different enemy types that really keeps things interesting. Some ""bullet hell"" sections are just incredibly intense and really gets your heart pumping.   With that said there are some technical issues present on the pc version, however they should be fixable with mods if it hasn't been patched by the time you're reading this.   Ive probably forgotten to say most things I wanted to say about this game. But Its amazing. I usually have to force myself to finish a game, but this one I really have to force myself to stop playing instead.			"

												Rig: Acer Aspire VN7-591G with a SSD I installed myself. (Windows 10)I'm finding this game to be really good.  I rented the PS4 version and by default, the PS4 version does run considerably better.  I'm not experiencing any bugs that other people are reporting so far and using the FAR mod, increases my performance to more or less put it on par with the PS4 version.  The mod certainly makes it play much more smooth if you know what you need to adjust. Progress: I'm currently about 3.2 hours in and at the amusement park (So not very far yet).  I would give this game a 10/10 if the developers actually displayed that they cared about us PC gamers but they didn't do a great job on the port.  But for now at least until they deliver an official patch, I'll give it about a 8/10 or so.  Good music, good gameplay, all around enjoyable for me.*Edit* I beat the game once as 2B now and can say it is a really great game indeed and I still haven't ran into any bugs (Still using the FAR mod for performance improvement).  The weirdness is strong in the game but in a good way.  I still have a bunch of things left to do in the game.			"

												If you're an AMD Radeon rx400 series owner, you'll want to stay away from this game in it's entirety, untill the developers or AMD releases an update that mfixes the blank white screen issue. The current build for this game makes it's completely unplayable for more than 5 minutes at a time! In all honesty I shouldn't be surprised, this isn't the first time that a new game on pc has had awfull support from AMD and game developers alike for the first few months of nearly any release nowadays. Now, as for what liittle I was able to play, the game has a fun combat system that hooked me in an instant, an interesting sci-fi premise of a desolate planet ruled by the mechanical children of the long departed human race, and a beautifull art style to boot, but until I'm able to play, this game gets a negetive review.My specs are as follows:OS: Windows 10GPU: Radeon Rx 480 8gb crossfireCPU: Intel i7 6700kRam: G.Skill Ripjaws 16gb DDR4			"

												TL;DRMy GPU type seems to commonly have issues with this game.I really wanted to post a positive review, but I cannot. I use a 780Ti GPU in my PC, and have no issues running the game - until it comes to not long after the first boss, where my screen will freeze. The audio continues in the background, but obviously it becomes unplayable with a frozen screen. After some quick googling, it seems that my GPU (the 780/780Ti) is commonly having issues for many people with either a screen freeze, or a white screen.I can't say much for the story, I can't make it far in, but the music and combat so far seem great. It's a real shame I can't play it much longer.Hopefully I'll play it in the future, but for now, I cannot.			"

												NieR: Automata is the product of 3 distinct talents in the videogame industry coming together and giving their all.

This is as close to perfect as it's going to get for a while.			"

												It's not even the second half of this year, and I think we've already got the GOTY 2017 on our hands. Amazing, memorable soundtrack composed by Keiichi Okabe, amazing story filled with bittersweet sidequests and 26 endings (5 of which are major) written and directed by Yoko Taro, sensitive and fluid combat crafted by Platinum Games, the team whose combat work can be seen behind the likes of Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance and whose respect for NieR can be seen in this very title.The PC port is kind of questionable, however Kaldaien's FAR (Fix Automata Resolution) will help overcome its limitations. (You can turn down global illumination to improve performance with little to no difference in visual quality; as well as increase the quality of godrays and bloom with the included fix by Durante) The former has compatibility for graphics injectors like ReShade which will help if you're not a fan of the game's grayish colors and want some vibrance to them. I personally used the Cinematic ReShade. For that to work with the former, I had to rename its dxgi as ReShade64 and ensured the paths the mod looks for the presets from match mine.Using a controller is highly recommended. If you're like me and you end up using Sony's DualShock 4, you might want to get the DS4 Button Prompts -mod whose ui -folder you'll place within the game's data -folder. While there's no official support for DualShock 4, you can utilize Steam Controller Configurator for it (if you don't like Big Picture Mode, just disable it from under [Steam > Settings > In-Game]), or get some unofficial third party programs like DS4Windows to do the job for you.Most port stuff can be looked up here though, including workarounds for the 60 FPS cap for example: http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Nier:_AutomataI ended up having one crash out of the 53 hours I placed in this title. Framerate was mostly 60, with dips to 45-60 in the most vegetated areas. I'm on i5-2500K, GTX 970 (using WHQL 378.66 -driver), 16 GB of RAM.This game has a demo on PS4, so if you happen to own one of those, you should give it a spin and see if it's to your liking. The game doesn't emphasize enough how important it is for you to replay the game: ending A is only the beginning; ending E is something special for you to experience.			"

												[EDIT]They just dumped a compiled for DX11 PS4 SKU to Steam with zero optimizations. This explains almost everything said below.[EDIT]1.Graphic is junk. AA is non-existent.2.Optimization is ♥♥♥♥ed up.  You are runnign a PS4 simulator on your pc.3.Camera is ridiculars. During combat, it might be totally blocked by an enemy or go inside a wall, or jump around like crazy. 4.Keyboard and mouce control feel like ♥♥♥♥. Especially when it comes to shooting. seems to be only 8-direction simulation.5.9S interfere with interaction a lot because of the same 'E' button and the way he follows 2B, it's really annoying when you want to open a chest or interact with an NPC and cant stop that freaking 'E' showing up above 9S's head.6.Combat feels like ff15, not bad, but with a strange hitbox. Most of time, you may feel like slashing some rocks.7.CG cutscenes are 30fps locked, very stiff with lots of stuttering, and the animation feels like off and on all the time.[EDIT]8.Gameplay itself is literally repeative, you go through exact the same missions during first and second run with same settings and only a little bit difference, and there are several missions so annoying that all you need to do is slash and hack infinite waves of enemies, taking hours to finish without access to quicksave. Just have a look at ff15 ch.13, this is even worse. Japanese people, please do not ruin Decent Designs, Magnificent Music and Splendid Storylines with your Terrible Techniques. Leaving them to any of those European or American game companies will end up with a Great Game.0/10THIS GAME IS PURELY A PILE OF ♥♥♥♥.			"

												Can't get through the first level because the game freezes. Couple that with no auto-saves, or even manual saves and you have something that's impossible to play.Also fullscreen mode has vertical bars on the sides and a stretched picture.

												With my PC, apparently this game will not run for long enough to even get a save file. The game has no auto save system, and you cannot save whenever you want, so if you experience white screen crashing like many people do (AMD and some Nvidia GPUs as well), you will not be able to save the game and continue after restarting it. The opening segment is not short, and I have replayed it 15 times at least, to no avail. I get further, but eventually I use a weapon and the game crashes. Start over! Yeah thanks, that is what I recieved for $60.I cannot recommend this game, especially if you have an AMD card or an older Nvidia. The chance that you could purchase a game that does not run is not acceptable in my opinion.			"

												It saddens me to write this review. I loved Nier and played the Demo for Nier Automata on the PS 4 and everything looked great and promising. It was one of the only games I bought close to its release in the last few years. I learned my ""never pre-order""-lessons pretty well.  Sadly I now own a game I paid lots of money for and I can't play it because I have a critical common issue (white screen) and can't even get to the first checkpoint. My only two options are to downgrade my driver to a very old version which will cause other problems in other games or wait for the developers of the game to fix this common problem which affects graphics cards of both popular factories (even if the ratio is a bit different between them).Well, this is the first time I saw a developer having a GREAT launch of the game with a major incident like this and no patch in 20 days. Not even an experimental one or beta one. It is heartbreaking to say, but I feel very close to dropping this game, which is considered art by many, from my ""most hyped game in ages""-list to my huge backlog of games and therefore might never touch it again.And the only way to express this to the devs is not by a refund as this will remove my rating here and not influence the score anymore thanks to Valves latest change to how reviews work if you refunded a game.I hope I can change this review in the future to a positive one. But I am not very optimistic anymore.			"

												For once, this is a Yoko Taro game I actually wanted to replay to get different endings. It's a really great sequel to the original NieR, but even if you haven't played that, this game still holds up well on its own.Music is great, setting and story are interesting. I honestly can't think of anything ""bad"" to say; not everything is perfect of course, for example the combat, while fast and fluid, is a bit shallow and spammy, and upgrading your weapons and using damage-boosting chips/items makes you stupidly OP. Some of the side quests are generic ""go here, then here"" or ""kill x enemies in this location"" or even the dreaded escort mission (where you can friendly-fire your client). But most of the side quests helped flesh out the world and characters a bit more. Also each run of the game is relatively short, but there is cool new stuff leading to each different ending. The characters have potential to be more fleshed-out but that doesn't really happen until at least the second playthrough, so until then they're sort of ""ehh"". The environments were pretty but somewhat lacked detail, there's not really much going on in them. But all this is basically nit-picking, I just wanted to present a more balanced view. One thing I did like was that, although most of the enemies you fight are machines, they have lots of variations and different abilities to make it a bit more interesting.tl;dr it's not ""OMG EPIC AMAZING"" but it's highly enjoyable, both for Taro fans and newcomers, and has lots of replayability and new stuff constantly being unveiled.

Would recommend if you're a fan of the good ol' Devil May Cry games and looking for an answer to your ""what would happen if Metal Gear Reveangence and Dark Souls loved each other too much and spend a night together?"" question. If you do not wish spend 60 bucks on it just yet, feel free to take a look at ""Furi"" which also uses a very basic version of Nier Automata's ""being able to use sword and pew pew in combat"" gameplay. Even though the game overall is 9/10, its port was lazily done and there are still some issues like ""lagging cutscenes because of the compressed video files"" so far so, I would recommend waiting for a patch to come out unless you're a fan of the genre.8/10			"

												Don't listen to other reviewers:it plays pretty good and its incredibly funpros+great gameplay+resolutions options are unlimited (i haven't had any of the known issues so far at 1440p)+60 fps cons-stutters from time to time (might be because everything is maxed)-performance could be better since 60% of my gpu is being used,it never dips under 60 though.(except for grassy areas)note:i'm running it with a 1080 so i can't really judge the performance			"

												Might be one of the best games I've ever played. Literally everything about the game itself is pretty good at WORST. The game throws you into an incredibly rich and thought provoking world but still never lets you feel out of your depth if it's your first game in the series as it was mine. Prior story knowledge enhances the experience but is not requred, the right way to do a sequel of this kind. The themes this game deals with in its story are some that are not usually approached in such detail by video games of this scale.  I would assume that's because examining the rights of artificial life, humanity's predisposition for self destruction and trying to fathom why things are, can get really, really depressing.  And this game does get very depressing, but I would chalk that up as a gigantic positive that a game engaged me on that emotional level. The best thing though is that Nier: Automata doesn't just ask the hard existential questions, if you play through the whole of the 5 main endings it offers some pretty compelling food for thought in terms of possible answers too.  The game also presents dilemmas to you in ways that you may not expect.  Basic ""choices"" you make when playing any game, such as simply attacking an enemy, are given significantly more weight when you have the proper context applied. Each of the main characters in the story and several of the supporting ones also undergo a sometimes short but distinct arc which is a breath of fresh air coming off of some more recent RPGs where the main character basically learns that you have to be responsible, the supporting cast never change and that's it *cough*FFXV*cough*.  It took just the right moves to get me invested in just about every important character in the game.The soundtrack is sublime. Start to finish the music is a powerful, subtle joy to hear. Some great soundtracks just steal the show so all you think about after is the music; personally I thought it just felt like every single song was more a great accompaniment to whatever moment it was layed gently on top of.  The combat wasn't as complex as I'd have liked.  I would have much preferred a little more depth to combo/defensive systems such as in Bayonetta, but it was still incredibly fun, responsive and visceral.  Even the shmup sections were a lot of fun.  Almost all of them struck the correct balance between challenge and frustration, and on top of that they never outstayed their welcome. I don't think people give the level design enough credit either.  I personally found the open world in this game maybe one of the best in recent years.  It is subject to changes, sometimes minor, sometimes major, it has a large variety of settings with different enemies, music and a lot of the time playstyles and towards the end of the game I was still finding new areas I hadn't been in before and little tucked away secrets. The ""collectibles"" are also very rewarding.  Hacking open a chest is almost never a waste of time.  You can get anything from a report detailing important and well written lore or a new weapon to test out.  Aside from a few weird technical issues where the game would randomly lose focus on my PC to nothing at all on my 2nd monitor, the mouse not being locked to the screen in game and it popping itself back into windowed mode every time I Alt+Tabbed the port was pretty solid in terms of framerate etc.  The graphical fidelity is the one area where I wasn't simply blown away.  I mean the game aesthetically looks amazing, but in terms of texture quality and graphical effects it's not very impressive at all. On several occasions usually when a character is silhouetted against a bright light, they turn into an 8-bit version of themselves and transform into blocks around the edges.That's easily overlooked in favour of the numerous other plus points though. A must play for anybody who enjoys Platinum combat, likes actually thinking while playing a game or if you just want to experience some of Yoko Taro's own brand of insanity.			"

												Honestly this is one of, if not the best game I've ever played. I cannot begin to express how empty I feel after playing this game. I am so obsessed with this game, I can't get the story out of my mind, it's inSANE. This game truly brings out that 'existential' question about one's purpose in life. Like foreal yo, this game made me question MY OWN LIFE, like HOLY MOLY DOOD. This game took me through a rollercoaster of emotions, of which are mostly sad tbh. BUT DAMN, the soundtrack aaaahhhhhhhh the soundtrack. Don't get me started on that...it's just.. just absolutely brilliant. I can't even comprehend how amazing the music is. The soundtrack goes so perfectly and I mean PERFECTLY TO THE ♥♥♥♥ING NOTE with the boss fights, scenery and sad ♥♥♥♥ing cutscenes. Not even joking this game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. Anyone who thinks not your nan is DED MATE. Now I'm going to live my life questioning my very existence with 2B's ♥♥♥ in my head. On a side note though, feels♥♥♥♥INGbad for your girl Pascal, that part hit me like a truck. ♥♥♥♥ me. 10/10 game. oh I forgot to mention I played this game 3 days STRAIGHT with about 5-6 hours of sleep till I comepleted it 100%.

Combat is improved upon and new playthroughs change more things than they did in the first game.However, the cast isn't as good as the first game's and neither is the music.Overall, the game is great.

Having bought Nier:Automata recently, with no prior experience with this game's cre[A]tor or even games from a similar [B]ackground, I feel urged to write a review just for personal [C]losure.Before I start, let me get one thing out of the way: This game is not ashame[D] of it's cultural background - in fact, it openly [E]ndorses it. If you did not come in contact with japanese RPGs be[F]ore, you will have to accept one thin[G] - the game may very well weird you out at times. If you learn to love that (or already did) - excellent. If you can accept it - also good. If you can at least ignore what might bot[H]er you in[I]tially - just as fine. You may [J]ust learn to like something entirely new. Or you might not, in which case - I won't judge, but your loss - or not ;) [K]nowing this, if you are sti[L]l interested, you [M]ay just be in for an experie[N]ce that can only be described as wonderfully unique in every way, shape or f[O]rm. The game is not perfect by a far margin, yet easily takes the cake as the #1 single[P]layer game I have touched in the last years, and this is not due to something specific - the general composition, the final product, is what makes this game both uni[Q]ue and amazing in a way I have never seen befo[R]e.The combat is ea[S]ily one of the most attractive fea[T]ures to new players - it is extremely rewarding, fluid, fast-paced and multi-faceted (and to know what I mean with the last part, yo[U] need to play through the game *several times*). Speaking of which - this game handles multiple endings [V]ery differently than most RPGs you might kno[W]. In fact, not only the endings, but the entire game mechanics transcend the barrier between player and game in ways you might not have ever seen before (especially if you did not play related games). This will only gradually reveal to you as you continue to play the same(!) savegame, and it manages the journey from something initially appearing as generic (maybe even ""cringey"" to use a horrible wording sometimes found on the internet to describe unknown territory) to something truly e[X]traordinary in every way, shape or form, ultimately ending in an experience that can best be described as thoroughl[Y] ""meta"" and astonishingly memorable. By the time I had achieved the last unlockable ending and watched myself [Z]oom by the credits (you will eventually understand what I mean and before you do you have not truly finished the game!), what had started out as a low expectations test run of my first JRPG for a long time ended up with a permanent place in my personal hall of fame of the best games ever made.10/10 - NOT an ""AAA title"" - NOT for everyone - does contain minor flaws - but if it is for you (even if you don't know it yet), you do not want to miss out on this masterpiece. Any rating below 10 would (for me personally) not do it justice, given that I was blown away by Yoko Taro, not having played any of his games before (or even knowing he existed). This man is a genius, and his product shows.			"

												Let me first be clear that NieR: Automata is a flawed game. It suffers from technical and design problem, some of which are quite severe; however it also gets so many things right that I'm willing to overcome the negative aspects of the game and still enjoy it.Pros: The combat system is awesome. It is smooth and responsive, you play as a very powerful character (with fantastically stylish animations too) yet not so much as to be blatantly overpowered, so being good at the game is still rewarding. To break it down to its bare minimum, it is a system about dodging and attacking, rinse and repeat; therefore it is relatively easy to be decent at this combat system. But there is actually a lot of depth hidden beneath, and the skill ceiling is extremely high as a result (you can actually juggle enemies if you are good enough). As a result it is more akin to Devil May Cry than it is to previous Platinum titles (although some of the animations are clearly inspired by Raiden). The story is serviceable and requires multiple playthroughs to be fully understood (3, to be exact). For the first playthrough it is a mostly non-cerebral plot about good guys and bad guys, but most of the story is reserved for further playthroughs. There are lots of dialogues and cutscenes added in each playthrough, and the gameplay mechanics are also drastically changed. The characters are also decent. At first I thought the protagonists resemble Lightning and Hope, but that is thankfully not true. For those that didn't play FF13 (good for you), that means the protagonists are likable and not bags of ♥♥♥♥♥♥. The villains on the other hand tend to spout philosophy about existentialism, which should be cringe worthy, but the voice over is good enough and it makes sense thematically that it works. Although they sadly don't have such classic one liners as ""nanomachines son"". (who is a character in the game, honest) The world is very intriguing and reminds me of Wall-E and 40K (I thought I would never put those 2 in the same sentence). It is a world where there is only war: after an alien invasion humanity abandoned the Earth and constructed androids to fight the alien's machine lifeforms, and the fight continued for a whole 6000 years. In the meantime humans have become something of a legend in this world, and it is fascinating and hilarious in equal measures to see characters study mundane facts of our lives and be thoroughly bewildered by them. Calling the music of NieR good would be an understatement. The tracks are all beautiful in their own rights, and the vocal by Emi Evans only makes it better. Also pretty much every track in the game has an 8-bit remix version. The camera perspective changes are interesting. Sometimes the game turns into a side scroller or a top down game. They do introduce problems of their own, however, such as difficulty interacting with things in side scroll perspective. The level designs encourage exploration. With the exception of one mission the entire game takes place on a world map, and different areas are connected with hidden passages. The size of the map isn't exactly massive when compared to some of the open world games, but it's still decent. Items are placed all over the map, and some are very tricky to get to. It sometimes take advantage of the 2D perspective as well: in the prologue for instance [spoiler alert]there is a part where you walk on a railing in 2D, which seems like there are only 2 directions you can move in, but there's actually a hidden path that requires you to walk toward the camera. It was one of the coolest secrets I have found in a long time. The aesthetics is intentionally drab, but it fits the omnious atmosphere, and serves to make the more colorful parts stand out even more.Cons: The PC port isn't great. The performance is mediocre, frame drops are somewhat common, and resolutions higher than 1080p are hugely demanding on the hardware. The resolution itself is also bugged and can be fixed with a mod on the forum. All cutscenes are also locked at 30fps. Moreover, some textures are awful looking (especially on walls), distant object pop-in is an issue, I have also encountered more crashes than I'd like (at least 4 in my playtime). Healing items are extremely overpowered. These can be bought from venders, are extremely cheap, and you can carry 99 of each type so running out of healing items should not be an issue. However they also are consumed instantaneously, so spamming healing is an easy way of overcoming the enemies. The caveat here is that using items require a few button presses, but once you get used to it it can be done in no time (or you can just pause and use it in the inventory). As if that wasn't enough there are many more passive bonuses that provide even more healing, so by the end I wasn't even using healing item much in all but boss fights. It does a poor job of explaining certain mechanics. There is no tutorial on some of the more advanced moves; and also some of the item descriptions are cryptic for no reason, example: down attack up. What exactly is a down attack is never explained. The sidequests are mechanically repetitive and boring. They are limited to escort someone, kill something, go to a place and interact with/pick up something, the obligatory racing minigame, etc. They also tend to need you to travel far and wide to complete the objective, often from one side of the map to another (there is fast travel). Thankfully they are thematically interesting and sometimes have decent stories attached to keep me engaged. Escorting a random NPC is one thing; escorting a machine wearing a ribbon that thinks it is a teenage girl is quite another. There is a Dark-Souls-like system where you need to get to your corpse after you die, and if you die twice in a roll you lose some of your stuff. But because of the lack of auto save this consequence is never permanent since you can just savescum. While the overall story is pretty good, the same cannot be said about the individual lines, as some are cringe inducing. During the 2D segments there are lots of invisible walls. The companion's pathing AI is incredible poor and will keep running into walls constantly. Not a big deal as they are still helpful in combat but it's still immersion breaking. The difficulty levels are also not well balanced in the early game. While on normal you are very resilient to damage, on hard even trash mobs can kill you in one or two hits, since hard enemies do more than 5 times as much damage as normal enemies. Later however you become so overpowered that even hard becomes much less intimidating though, which serves as a nice consolation. "

			New graphics comparison for Nier Automata between PC 'Ultra' settings in 4K and PS4 Pro in 4K. To see any (minimal) difference you must watch this video in fullscreen and 2160p on a 4K monitor...		

This game is great, probably one of the better games in 2017. I'm so happy that this time it's not a lazy pc version :)If you have a good pc for 4k gaming and a ps4, don't hesitate, pc version is better ;) "

												So everyone really, really likes NieR: Automata. The only negative reviews I see on Steam are because of the problems with the PC port or just people giving up after a couple of hours for whatever reason. I played this game through to the end, all 5 important endings (ABCDE), so I've given this game its fair shake. I still don't like it and I can't really understand why others do like it. I understand the themes it was going for and admittedly those themes are interesting. However, I think the game fell flat in its execution. First off I could not care less about any of the characters. None of the tear jerking moments caused any emotion in me. Now, you might think I'm a heartless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or a psychopath, but that's not the case. I just felt like the characters and their relationships were never really fleshed out. I still feel like I don't know a whole lot about 2B, 9S and A2 (apart from 9S liking 2B). Most of the cast don't have any real personal motivation for what they do in the story (again with the exception of 9S). It is, at best, vaguely hinted at in the main story. Maybe a lot of this is hidden in away in text entries, but I don't spend hours reading that stuff. But, if important things like character motivations are hidden away in text form, then that's just bad storytelling, in my opinion. Add on top of all this death has no real consequences for reasons explained in the story, and any semblance of my personal investment in the characters or what happens to them just disappears compeletely.Second off, I absolutely HATED my second playthrough. Barely anything changed content-wise, which leads to a 6-hour slog through a portion of story I've played already. The game drip feeds you some tiny droplets of story, but it wasn't anywhere near enough to keep me interested. ALso, 9S's hacking minigame got extremely stale after doing it for the umpteenth time. The gameplay overall is fairly shallow. The spectacle fighting has less going on than, say, God of War or Bayonetta with less moves than either of them. I enjoyed it during my first playthrough, but after those 10ish hours, I'd had enough. The bullet hell gameplay is much worse and just straight up boring to me. If you hold down the square & R1 button on a PS3 controller and move around a bit, you'll usually be fine.Also, side quests are Dragon Age: Inquisition levels of bad: fetch quests galore. I stopped doing them after the fifth one had me walking 10 minutes to go collect 5 more bear's asses with barely any story and no voice over to make up for it.Finally, I felt the overall story was poorly patched together with important plot points being glossed over and hardly explained. I asked myself multiple times why or how a particular event was happening and could not come up with a satisfying answer. Again, I didn't spend too much time reading the text entries. I'm sure many people will tell me I didn't get it and they may well be right. I'm definitely eager to watch some deeper analysis videos on this game. I might come to appreciate the game more in time.PS: I should add the caveat that I haven't played many JRPGs and no Yoko Taro games before this one. The ones I did play, I didn't really enjoy. If you are a fan of that particular genre or of Yoko Taro, this may well be right up your alley.			"

												Yet another terrible PC port from Squaresoft. Inability to display in Fullscreen, inability to transmit game to a steam link, randomly crashes to desktop during tutorial. And no...I'm not going to waste my time downloading third party or community solutions for a game I paid $60 for. Thank you Steam for your awesome refund system to protect us from poor quality products like this one. SquareSoft has been around long enough and they should be better at this by now. This will be the last pc title of theirs I ever attempt to buy.			"

												IF YOU OWN A 780 SERIES GRAPHICS CARD, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!You have a high chance of the screen just freezing while gameplay continues to run in the background. This problem seems to happen more often in fullscreen mode and with TI cards.This game has another huge problem where the resolution refuses to go any higher than 900p no matter what you set it to. Anyone with two monitors can easily confirm this.If these two issues are fixed I look forward to changing this review to a positive one. They seem to have basically fixed my main complaint from the demo, which was that you could just mash dodge to become literally invincible. Dodge timing is still generous, but I can no longer dodge up and down inside a laser beam and not take any damage, which is a big improvement.			"

												Don't buy if you want to play with KBM. ♥♥♥♥-poor implementation. It's a 1:1 mapping of joystick axis to mouse axis, and it feels TERRIBLE. A few other things:I'm very  confused by the seemingly random use of top-down view in fights. It doesn't make sense to me, as you still have 3d movement, so you can still jump but you don't see how far up you are nor can you see how high the enemy projectiles are, making it unnecessarily hard to dodge them.The save system seems weird, I died ~40 minutes into the game and had to start from the beginning. Didn't see any save station along the way.The game world looks beautiful, the graphics are okay (lots of low res textures, rest is decent).Performance is good (enough), 60 FPS lock though.Will refund it and probably pick up at a later point.

												TL;DR :  Wait for it to be patched, there are issues for many people across each major graphics card manufacturer and across the spectrum of PCs with low mid and high range hardware.  Initial Review on release 3/17/18 (To be updated in the near future)Pros:Gorgeous visualsFun and varied gameplayFantastic soundtrackSexy protagonistPretty Good performance with a mid to high end rigCons:Hack & Slash heavy which may bore some30fps cap on cutscenes that tend to drop below 30fpsPerformance issues Fullscreen causes performance issuesFullscreen only renders at 900p and upscales for 1080p and aboveConfiguration settings for display, cameras, and controller can suddenly revert for no reasonNetworking integration has been blamed for stuttering on otherwise capable systemsSome graphics cards are overloaded at 100% utilization due to game codeGame is capped at 60fps due to the method of timing for events used in the codeMy rig is a water cooled i7 4790k, samsung SSDs, 16GB DDR3, and a 1060GTX w/ 6GB ram.  I run games such as DOOM, GTA V, and Rise of the Tomb Raider with all settings maxed out at 1080p with nearly perfect 60fps.  NieR: Automata runs in the 50's with nearly constant stuttering at 1080p with AA disabled, blur disabled, windowed mode enabled, and all other settings maxed.  The stuttering causes noticeable hitches and screen tearing that take away from the experience.  This card is easily capable of smoother experiences in other games.  With Fullscreen enabled, the frame rate dips into the 30's with the same settings and that's just ridiculous.This game is in need of some optimization, but by no means is this a mess like the recent Batman bomb.  If you're going to pay $60 for a game, the experience should be better optimized than this.  Even considering that it is a port, it's still not a great port.  As such, I simply can't recommend the game in its current state.  The various issues need to be resolved.  If that happens, I'll gladly recommend it.			"

												Don't even try to play this game above normal difficulty with mouse and keyboard.... A potentially great game ruined by some of the worst controls I've seen since the original Dark Souls port.Using the dodge is one of the fundamental keystones to actually playing the game well, but when the game eats your inputs, you end up getting destroyed by things you absolutely saw coming. Things you absolutely reacted to. Things you should not be getting hit by. Dodge is bound to double-tapping your directional movement key, and is locked to that same key. You cannot, for instance, hold shift and tap a directional key or something along those lines. This becomes a hue problem to enjoying the game, since without the ability to dodge in and out of enemies to use your melee attacks, you end up slowly walking backwards while using your ranged attacks to slowly whittle them down. A lot of the potentially fun gameplay is lost.Enhancements are a pain in the ♥♥♥ to use. These things grant tiny bonuses, lasting 15-30 seconds each (with enormous benefits, mind you), but you have to pause the game every single time you want to try and use them for a small portion of a single boss fight, tab through menus, get to the correct ones you wish to use, and then go down the list to reapply them. You end up spending more time trying to apply the buffs you receive, than actually using said buffs. Using them completely destroys any prospect you have of enjoying the difficult fights (and you will need to use them, as half your dodges are eaten by your keyboard inputs).Also, since you can't open the menu to actually find the enhancements until you are completely standing still on the ground, you have to deal with pausing and unpausing over and over again until you can finally open the menu. I wouldn't care about this as much, if you could reliably escape enemy attacks.Aiming your pod to shoot is quite nearly (nierly) impossible for some sections, and you have to rely on the lock-on mechanism to whittle away at certain enemiesin some of the most dull, uninteresting waste of time I've ever experienced. Your pod will default to aiming in the direction you are moving, and you have to constantly push your mouse in the direction you wish to fire, unless you prefer to stand still and eat ♥♥♥♥ the entire time. This would be okay if you have mile-long arms, as well as a mile long and wide desk, but you don't, and this is only acceptable if you have two analog sticks to work with. Auto-aim is not permitted on the harder two difficulties, so good luck without it.The camera angle and controls are barf-worthy. I ended up needing to play in a much smaller window / resolution than normal, and had to zoom the camera almost to its maximum distance just to actually play. The thing swoops and swoons all over the place as you struggle to keep your screen facing a mobile enemy. Auto-lock doesn't help this, but is required to actually keep some semblance of an eye on your target, especially when there is a very specific weak spot you need to hit. This has less to do with the PC controls, and is more to do with poor choices when it comes to actual development. Even simply running along the ground becomes barfy when the camera slowly shifts to be completely horizontal with your character's running line. I have to consistently pull my mouse down in an attempt to get a view from a higher vantage point. If I don't, it automatically resets to directly behind your character, and it makes (me and everyone I've spoken to) feel sick. Also, it makes it artificially difficult to find things you need to pick up. tl;drControls are ♥♥♥♥ for mouse + keyboard, either play with a controller, or don't play at all. Or wait until it goes on sale. Or for someone who has ever actually used a mouse and keyboard to play a game fixes the setup.			"

												Messy port. Massive hassle to switch between displays, different resolutions, and full screen/windowed. GTX-1070 needs mostly low settings at 1440p to maintain a decent frame rate.I want to like the game, I want to enjoy it, but I have not been able to just sit down and start playing it. If I need to alt+tab to respond to a message, I have to sit through a minute of my displays turning on and off before the game says ""♥♥♥♥ it"" and stops responding. Every time you change a single graphical setting, you have to wait ~6 seconds before you can confirm and move on. You have to restart the game to decide which display you want to use for full-screen. I almost wish I had a PS4 just so that I could play this on my TV without having to deal with so much non-sense. I want to give the game a positive review but I can't recommend something that puts up this much hassle over simple things.Lovely voice acting, character designs, and atmosphere. Will keep the game and keep playing instead of  refunding but it looks like I'm stuck to playing on the 1080p monitor at my desk instead of the 4K TV in front of my couch. Really  bothersome when games I've paid much less for had these things figured out and sorted.			"

												i5 6600K970 Nvidia16GB Corsair LED SeriesUltraWide 3415WThe game is terribly optimized.  I spent the greater half of today attempting to get the frames anywhere above 30.  I had to turn all visual options off and set low what I could.  With the lowest possible setting I get an inconsistent 30-40 frames.I bought the game on PC instead of my PS4 Pro because of the ultrawide support.  The 21:9 ratio is there, but the resolution (3440x1440) does not look the part. Additionally, the UI is not set to 21:9 and the cut-scenes run stretched as opposed to black bars.  It's a mess for ultra-wide. Batman: Arkham City wasn't this bad, I have absolutely no idea how this game made it pass QA on the PC.  I have not had any issues running anything I toss at my PC till I came to Nier.  The game is not a visual landmark to quantify anything more then I am already providing.  Do not make the same mistake and buy this on the PC till a patch is release.  I would love to give more input on the game itself, yet the frustration of the inconsistent frames during game, yet also in cut-scenes and menu navigation has made it impossible to progress without encumbering to motion sickness.The soundtrack is great, does not skip!

												Warning: This game doesn't autosave. You cannot manually save for the entire opening mission. If the game crashes before you finish it, you have to restart the whole thing. If you don't finish it for any reason, you will have to start over. This game also has framerate issues in the cut scenes, and I cannot get this game to play over 40fps even with the settings reduced, it seems to make no difference either way. The framerate isn't an issue as it still seems to be smooth while playing, other than the cut scenes. The game kicked me out of full screen in the middle of combat multiple times, and the window shrank to the size of a dialogue box on my desktop. I could not change it until out of combat and it was extremely difficult during a boss fight.The lack of save feature is really what is killing it for me though. Regular saves should be a standard for games.Gameplay and mechanics are decent, nothing ground-breaking. The story is meh, the map is difficult to read at least for me, and the camera is annoying. I like the game so far and think it has a lot of promise, though with the current issues I can't justify giving this a thumbs up at the moment. Perhaps after a patch or two have been released, I can change my review.Just my honest opinion, and yes 1.3 hours is plenty of time to get a healthy opinion of this game.			"

												tl;dr If you like a good story, sound and atmosphere, it's a great game. If you also enjoy good gameplay and more deep mechanics than repeatedly pressing the same one or two buttons, then mybe skip this one.So the game is really good when it comes to worldbuilding, story, atmosphere, music. And for that reason alone I'll finish it for sure eventually.The real problem and furstration comes from the lacking game design. What you actually DO as a player is rather simple and repetitive. They add a lot of elements to the game, like twin stick shooting third person hack and slash and neither really is well fleshed out. I hoped at least the melee combar part of the game would be good, since it's the same company that also made Bayonetta. But apparently they must've fired all people invovled in that and hired some trainees for that job or something idk.Mostly you just hit evade and then attack. You can't really combo well or creatively as you'd expect if you played Bayonetta or DMC before. It's just hit the same buttong multiple times for some cool looking moves and that's pretty much it.Also difficulty is really badly designed. It's either a cakewalk or you almost die in one hit. No change to enemy behaviour though (which would make it actually interesting and challening), just more damage/life and that's it. Oh and for some reaons also no lock-on on higher difficulty. Apparently, limiting player controls is good game design now and the way to make games challenging -_-Also you can easily end up in sidequests or areas that are wayyyy too hard in terms of simple player vs monster level. I tried doing a sidequest that was on the way to some other main quest and was lvl 12 and encountered lvl 32 enemies there. I did vitrually zero damage and died in like 2 hits. Generally speaking, it feels like enemies have wayy too much hp most of the time, even small trashmobs take forever to kill and just feels like artifically lengthen the gameplay time without adding much. Speaking of not adding much. Enemies are mostly the same few general models, sometimes with a small twist, but mostly the same, except later they get higher levels thus deal more damage and have more hp. So, not so much variety there either.Bossfights are mostly cool and interesting though, gotta give them credit for that. But yeah, all in all, unless you wanna simply play it for the story, I wouldn't play the game at all. Gameplay-wise it has too little to offer that's well fleshed out and challenge-wise it's not well enough balanced and the mechanics are too lacking to provide a fun and fair challenge.Alos might want to add, this review comes from a guy who spends a lot of hours daily playing games, so if you just want to find something cool to relax after working, this game might be pretty good for you.

												Do not buy this game yet as it has multiple day one bugs and poor optimization that makes it crash for a lot of people regardless of PC specs. I'd recommend waiting a week or maybe even a month until they hopefully make this game playable.If you still want to buy this game because you think it looks great, don't be surprised if it does nothing but crash for you and make you reach for the refund button.From the tiny amount of progress I've managed to make between crashes:The game looks okay once you get around the fullscreen bug that causes the graphics to render in a lower resolution and then upscales it which makes the game look like it was made for the PlayStation 2. Anti-Aliasing doesn't seem to have any impact other than making the game no longer run at a smooth 60FPS. Cutscenes are all locked to 30FPS while the rest of the game is locked to 60.Music score is great, game mechanics are great.Highly recommend playing with a controller unless you want the game to be even more challenging as KB+Mouse isn't optimal. Controller input can be fully customized if you don't like any of the 3 layouts.If you're here for the story or want an extreme challenge then both Easy and Very Hard will make you feel right at home. Easy Mode enables access to various Auto-Chips that can be toggled on and off on the fly (At the cost of manual auto-aim control since there's no auto-lock-on chip that you can disable and instead disables if you manually uninstall all auto-chips) which essentially enables god mode as you will automatically attack and evade. Meanwhile on Hard mode lock-on is completely disabled and on Very Hard you die in one hit.			"

												Release day review:Considering this game had extra time to release on PC, the issues Square Enix has released this game are unforgivable.Major cons:1) No proper 4k resolution support2) Clear optimization issues for the PC version3) Not enough key/button customization for PC users, (i.e. no option to rebind mouse button controls). Also no option to setup another dodge key setup other than the cancerous double tap method.4) No decent consideration for mouse looking camera controls All of the above is especially unforgivable when you compare a perfect analogy to Square Enix's release of Nier Automata and another Square Enix title, Final Fantasy 14.What both share (so no room for arguments on ""but it's different!|""):1) Same publisher2) Both games have console and PC versions, which both favoring console mindset/control schemesAnd yet, FF14 has none of the cons of Nier Automata and even more so goes far beyond to being very considerate of PC version setup and control schemesWhat FF14 does better for PC version:1) Allows FULL 4k support2) Runs very well (with even better graphics despite being an older game than Automata) on PC even at 4k (I get solid 60fps)3) FF14 probably has THE most best customization options for keys and UI that has ever existed in an MMORPG or any game for that matter, also allowing ""key bindings"" to use mouse button bindings (unlike Automata)4) Very good mouse camera controls and options, again probably the best in not only MMORPGs but most other genre gamesMy sub for FF14 just so happened to run out of Nier Automata's PC release date and as I was looking forward to playing it, I figured would not resub until I was done playing Automata. But since there is a lot of issues that need to be fixed in Automata. I will go back to playing FF14. And if the issues don't get fixed in Automata, I will refund this game.I actually also suggest people refund this game until it is fix (not liking you are losing a preorder discount [unlike many Steam release games). If anything, you might up saving money by refunding now and rebuy when it is on sale and actually a proper PC port (if they ever manage it). "

												I want to love this game. The couple of hours I actually managed to slip in between freezing/crashing made me love it. I CANNOT reccommend currently to anyone with a 780/780ti as of write now a few weeks after launch it is unplayable for MOST 780/780ti users. As well as quite a few AMD and gtx980 users. Please do not buy if you have these cards until an official patch as there is not even a reliable fan patch yet. Steam should warn people on the store page to be honest. If you don't believe me look at the thousands of comments on steam forums and reddit as well as nvidia forums just by googling Nier freezing. The game image will freeze yet still plays in the background but forces you to quit and restart OR it just crashes to white. Some times this happens every 5 minutes sometimes you can go a couple hours without it. It seems the prologue and the amusment park are the biggest problems with this at the moment. Most people will pass the two hours refund time while trying to fix it youself. It can't be done so just wait for an all clear if you have these cards. Especially if you don't usually spend 60 dollars on games.			"

												I have had so many issues just starting the game that I'm returning it.  The sound is sub-par on my sound system, continuous errors, no DS4 controller support, this is highly unacceptable.  I find it strange how so many people push the ""PC is the best for gaming"" when games CONSTATLY release busted and broken like this was.  I'll get it on PS4, where I don't run into issues just playing games.Congratulations Steam, you've once again lowered my expectations of what to expect in the future.			"

												Terrible keyboard controls, voice over isn't great. Lock on is pratically required to be able to shoot but every kill you get it unlocks you but don't worry any difficulty higher than normal disables lock on completely. No way to rebind the dodge on keyboard so you are forced to use double tap in only 4 directions.  Locked at 60fps in 2017 is disappointing and controller is pratically required.			"

												Day 1 review:Well, even considering the bad reviews mentioning the fact that it doesn't have full controller support, only 720p in fullscreen and not too good performance I bought the game, because the gameplay looks good.I started the game and it was fine, no performance issues, graphics looks nice, the voice acting is good etc.35 minutes into the game, in the middle of a fight, the image just froze on me, the sound still went on but the image was frozen, I waited for a few minutes but nothing changed, checked google for some tips and apparently this is a common issue. Well I ALT + F4 the game and start it up again, while thinking about how the game told me that there's no auto save feature in the game so you need to save it manually, the pain I felt when I got back into the game, went on continue and saw that I had 00:00:00 on my playtime, knowing that I had to go through the painfully boring start where you fly a transformer/jet and need to listen to dialogue. Well I went through all that and got to the melee combat again, only this time it froze in the very first fight, I started over AGAIN, went through the same tutorial again and got to the melee part again, this time I got to the buzzsaw fight (the first one) and guess what, it froze again. :)One last ALT + F4, now I will wait for some kind of update that fixes some of these issues, well at least the issue that makes the game unplayable, if not then i'll just return this piece of ♥♥♥♥ and get my money back.Hardware: Intel I7 3820 3,6GHz16 GB RAMGTX 780			"

The gameplay dosnt work for mouse and keyboard for the way they switch cameras and gameplay making twin stick shooters but with the mouse the camera snaps to a set location if your not moving your mouse.

												Whether you're eating the booty like groceries or giving anal $ex a shot NieR: Automata is brilliant. It strikes the balance between RPG and action game unlike anything else in the genre. It’s a game you kind of have to meet halfway, with a story that gets more complex and interesting the more your prod at it. Pros -Satisfying combat-Inventive and surprising-Movement feels incredible-Brilliant soundtrack-Nice booty Cons -Invisible walls-Camera can be annoying-Ugly in places-Some game breaking bugs (Edit: most of them were fixed by modders)Thanks to Platinum Games knack for riveting and gratifying combat, Automata is Yoko Taro's most exciting game to date. The combat mechanics click after hurdling a low learning curve, and the end result is a skillful dance where balletic dodges complement wushu-inspired aggression. Moreover, this multi-ending trip is generously peppered with surprises and revelations, as well as easter eggs that call back to the first game and the Drakengard series from which Nier spun off. It's a meaty, often exhilarating trek that showcases Platinum Games and Yoko Taro's unique blend of genius.			"

												I cannot recommend this game whilst it is so wrought with crashes. I was unable to play beyond the first five or ten minutes without experiencing the ""white screen"" crash. I tried many things to fix it, but to no avail. The ten minutes I have played were fantastic, but do not justify a £39.99 pricetag. I will keep an eye out for a patch that addresses it, and may re-purchase at that point. If the bug is then fixed, I will update this review. Until then, the game is unplayable. Not recommended.Edit: Oh, and yes, my computer meets the requirements. Smashes it out of the park really. I upgraded recently and my computer met the recommended requirements -before- the upgrade.

												Each second this game reminds me how much better it could be, how many opportunities were ruined, how many useless design decisions were added to the game...It was good at some points but all of them were followed by a big freaking BUT:The story itself might be interesting BUT not when it's mostly told by the childish character (the worst of the main trio).The animations were awesome and the combat system was great BUT why in the name of all gods were they sometimes pulling camera off to the ceiling or one of the sides making the game look like a freaking 2d with no option to turn this feature off?The characters... well... in my opinion it was a greatest mistake of the game, to use the worst of them as a main storyteller (based on the actual gameplay time and his appearance in the story routes) I bet my life there was a better way to tell this story.Would i recommend it? Maybe...Would i call it a good game? I'm not sure...I was really trying to love this game, but in the end it only led me to a bigger disappointment... and to a story with no conclusion.			"

												A cult classic in the making.Don't let technical (and fixable) issues drive you away from this gem.The game plays really smoothly, having a fast paced combat suitable for both novices and experts: it has depth if you want to experiment with moves and weapons, but it's not strictly required to progress. Navigating the areas also feels very smooth, and while the prologue is completely linear, the more open maps allow for quite a bit of freedom of movement, complemented by hidden areas and secrets.Everything else, from music, to visuals, to the setting itself, has a strong sense of identity, and it's beautifully crafted with an eye for details.

												While i have yet to finish the game, i can say without any doubt that this game is a masterpiece.  Nothing prepared me for Nier: Automata.  I had heard the first one was a great game even though it was not crtically acclaimed or a financial success.  SE took a risk here and boy does it pay off.  Nier Automata is one of the best games this generation EASILY.  The combination of Platinum games and Yoko Taro storytelling is perfect.  The fast paced combat of the game accompanied by one of the best OST's in gaming history and a gripping emotional story make this game a must have for fans of both jrpgs and action games.  The PC version did have its faults, but its FAR from being a bad port.  Once you get the mods to fix the small issues you are good to go at full 60fps 1080p glory.  Highly recommended game. "

												Was very looking forward to this pc release but unfortunatly I'm experiencing numerous crashes and bugs during the first few minutes of the game. Windows 7i7 4770kx2 RX 480'sRadeon Version: 16.12.1 (Update to recommended version, no change. Although the note stats it was an issue with Windows 10 and Radeon cards)Each time when launching the game it starts out in Windowed and will need to be manually switched to Fullscreen. Resolution would also be incorrect and would need to be manually changed as well...if I launched again it will state the correct previous resolution but is not applied. Which then I would have to manually set it...agian. This game does not support Auto-Save...So that has left me in a situation where the game has yet to get to a point for me to save before it crashes again. Everytime I start over....I HAVE TO START OVER, OVER. Until this is resolved I will request a refund until these issues are addressed. I am quite disappointed by yet another low quality assured port.  "

NieR seems not even closer but, just keep play.oh byw, graphic difference with PS4 pro is just few lighting effects, which is....hard to say since I'm expecting a better enviorment texture but, yeah, don't be cheap I think.

												Upon 100% completion of this game I only felt one thing. I want to play and experience this masterpiece of art all over again. Every single aspect of this game works toward the goal of creating a meaningful and unique experience that is unmatched by the majority of games that are made these days. The passion and dedication required to make this game oozes through every single moment. This game doesn’t try imitate another medium like film or novel instead it embraces its identity as a game and utilizes this to become one of the best games of all-time and a defining moment in the history of video games. Gameplay The gameplay in this game is one of the most gratifying things in existence. It is one of the most original mashups of two different genres of game I have ever played. It combines the best elements of hack and slash with bullet hell into a tight, highly enjoyable package that never fails to be a blast to play. Its addictive nature means that even in the late game it never becomes a chore to play. There are four different types of weapons these are small swords, large swords, spears and combat bracers. All of the weapons have a sense of weight behind them meaning every weapon is both satisfying and entertaining to use. There is a whole sleuth of weapon combos that can be achieved leading to you wanting to find the best combo that suits your playstyle. At first it may seem like there is a lack in enemy variety however this is not the case. As you progress through the game each enemy type becomes more advanced and varied with their weapon choices. So one moment you may be fighting two goliath bipeds and the next moment you are faced off against a mixture of small flying units and a horde of medium bipeds equipped with axes. All of this means every engagement has a sense of originality. The bullet hell aspect comes from the fact that you have a pod unit that fires either bullets, laser or missiles however the laser and missile types must be found throughout the world. The game does not feature a normal leveling up upgrade system rather it uses a plug-in chip system where you have an allocated number of slots that you fill with plug-in chips you find in the world. From this you can build your character the way you want play.  Sound Now nothing in this game sounds completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic except the music. Now that is not me saying everything sounds like trash. The weapons sound like they are making a real impact when they hit the enemy and the ambient effects all sound good aswell but nothing ever stands out but when the music is a completely different story. This is perhaps the best video game OST I have ever heard. It effortlessly transitions from awe inspiring to downright depressing at times. The music works great within the context of the story and helps punctuate the more emotional moments of the game. Every area you visit has a unique theme that changes depending on what you are doing in that area for example when you first arrive at the amusement park the music starts off with a slow piano and equally slow vocals but as you progress into the area it gets faster and by time you are fully engaged in combat the music is fast and exhilarating fitting excellent with the gameplay. There is not a single weak track in the game. Some of my personal favourite tracks are Amusement Park, A Beautiful Song, Weight of the World, End of the Unknown, Dark Colossus - Kaiju, Copied City, Mourning, Song of the Ancients - Atonement, The Sound of the End, Weight of the World the End of YoRHa and Emil - Despair. The voice acting is also amazing across the board with especially great performances from Emil’s, Pascal’s and 9S’ voice actors.   Graphics The texture work in this game isn’t the greatest however the impressive lighting made every environment look stunning and it was a joy just to wander around this beautiful world. The character models all looked great and some parts of the characters bodies looked absolutely gorgeous most notably 2B’s ♥♥♥. I wouldn’t mind her sitting on my face. Also I would let the commander choke me with those thighs. All the weapon models look highly detailed. There was some texture pop-in in some places like when I first arrived at the forest castle the walls where all untextured until I walked right up to them. The cutscenes are all displayed 900p @ 30fps which is extremely puzzling and is jarring as you transition from smooth 1080p @ 60fps to a choppy cutscene. I never experienced any framerate or resolution problems. I wouldn’t say it’s a horrible PC port but it isn’t a good one either. Story I have never played the original NieR but I do know a lot about it’s story as I have played the original Drakengard (To which NieR is a spin-off). You can go into this game without knowing anything about the original game and still understand and enjoy this masterfully told, poignant story. The game is set in the year 11945, during the 14th Machine War. Aliens have invaded Earth using machine lifeforms and the humans fought back using androids. Eventually the humans retreat to the moon. You play as YoRHa android called 2B and you are accompanied by another android 9S as you try to destroy the machines and win the war. I won’t go into to much detail about the story itself as it would spoil it however rarely has any story of any kind had such an impact on me. All the twists that happen don’t happen just for the sake of being a twist but there are hints dropped throughout the game in some of the main story moments and even in the sidequests as well. Some of the character stories are absolutely heart-wrenching to witness. My only criticism is that some of 9S’ and 2B’s interactions with the machines are bit out of character sometimes but other than that the story in this game could potentially be the best storyline ever written for a video game. Conclusion  This game is a masterpiece. It fully uses the fact that it is a game and delivers a memorable and unforgettable experience that I have had the pleasure of enjoying. Never before has a story being so impactful that I constantly think about it. Never before has a game been so fun that I just want to play more. Never before has characters been so well written that I couldn’t help but fall in love with them. I would fully recommend this game to anyone who enjoys games as true art and this is perhaps one of the best games ever made and this is definitely my favourite game of all time.  "

												Well, i wish i could say it was money well spent, but the game is amazing except that its moving in slow motion no matter what graphics, shadow, resolution i set it to. I put my computer on high performance and it still moves at like 1/4 of the speed its shown to in gameplays. Which sucks, ive been looking forward to this since it came out. Also, im not the only one having this issue, right now its unplayable, cant even get past the first level, i play for over an hour and a half and im not even halfway through level 1, or it just freezes suddenly. Otherwise this would be my favorite game. As it is now, i sadly cannot recommend it to others since, not everyone it seems is experiencing this issue, but i cant in good notion recommend it, and then have them experience this, since it is then a waste of money, time, excitement and honestly makes the game unplayable since you can hit dodge about 5 seconds before a hit, and still get hit by their attack and then their next several before you even dodge. Your character moves in slow motion and its supposed to be a fast paced battle game. Please fix this so your customers arent wasting their money and time			"

												Tech Performance Details:I own both the PS4 Slim and PC edition, and wanted to share some experiences with performance comparing the two.PC Rig: i7-3930K / 32gb Ram / 980TiIn full screen it runs at 900p, using the windowless hack it can run at my screen's native 1440p, but it causes jitter issues. Even though it has the same resolution as the PS4 version, it still looks a little nicer due to better AA, filtering, shadows and shader effects. 60fps lock doesn't bother me as my screen cannot handle any higher anyway. The PC version holds the 60fps nearly perfectly. Much better than the PS4 version anyway. My PC has the same cut scene frame drop issues others have reported. Over 10 hours on the PC version and not a single crash or freeze. There have been a few camera glitches, but the PS4 version has had some too. Overall, I don't think it's a terrible port. There's a few issues with it, but it still looks and plays better than the PS4 version at least on my rig. I do hope that patches unlock the resolution though.-- Actual Game Review --Starting Adventure:I killed a robot the size of an oil rig. Arrived in a city where I jumped straight off a tall building not thinking about fall damage. Just survived the fall, and then a moose came up and finished me off. All this game needs is great characters with futuristic gothic lolita clothing and it'd be perfect...Gameplay:A game that doesn't necessarily do anything original, but takes some great elements from many others and glues them all together in a surprisingly coherent way. There's a little bit if variety with side scrollers, bullet hells and of course, high speed hack 'n' slash. Really responsive controls with a brilliant free-flowing combo system make for one of the best combat games I've ever played. The attention paid to character movement is fantastic and makes all the excessively long jaunts around the world quite enjoyable.Difficulty:Normal mode. Pretty easy actually. This isn't a complaint though. It's fun to just sit back and unwind and get into that lovely combo groove. Most problems are generally caused by stupid mistakes or not learning the mechanics properly. If a harder time is wanted then there are two more difficulties above that. Maybe more, don't know as I'm trying to avoid potential spoilers.Story:No spoilers. So far, really good. It has a more dire tone is general, but then features the usual quirky and silly elements blended in. Due to the main tone though, the silly elements can often feel a little more disturbing which is a great addition.Graphics:Massive fan of the art style. Great costumes, environments and colour palettes. 2B's animation deserve special note as well. Beautiful weight and response to the environment around her. The best illustration of this is attack once with a staff weapon and wait for her sheathing animation. Just beautiful.As for technical achievements, it is damned impressive. Nice skin shaders and cloth physics. Excellent environmental draw distance, but characters and props do suffer from noticeable popup. Some textures are a little low res, so they stand out a little. Same with some NPC models.Sound:This is a real strong point for Nier. The soundtrack is nothing short of gorgeous, with it's mix of instrumental and vocal tracks. The use of multi-track fades makes it even more enjoyable as the music changes to fit the environment and action. Massive credit needs to be given for the use of stereo imaging on the soundtrack, something that very few games seem to even attempt, let alone do well. Wasn't a huge fan of 2B's English voice, so switched to the Japanese track which feels a lot more appropriate given her design and personality. Thank you for keeping that option available. The Japanese dub has been really good in general.The sound effects are also outstanding with really nice positional audio and great filters for reverbs when needed. The text dialogue typing noise is a little grating, but I have that problem with most games.Conclusion:A really nice game that really deserves a try. The only reason to not play this game is if you really dislike hack 'n' slahes. If you feel a game needs to run at the highest resolution with the fastest frame rates to warrant consideration, wait it out for now.			"

												Warning: Not everyone's computer can run this at a steady 60 FPS at 1080p. If you lose your ♥♥♥♥ at 56-59 FPS, if not running a game on ultra chills you to the bone, or playing in borderless window mode makes you vomit this game is not for you.So far this game feels like Bayonetta in an ""open world"" environment. It's not totally open world but the maps are huge with lots of places to just get lost in, finding treasure and sidequests. My only gripe so far is the camera likes to ""showcase"" different angles at times, sometimes transitioning from 3D controls to 2D controls at some parts. Sometimes it does a horrendous top down angle on some parts of levels that really screws with depth perception (like a lot of the game is aerial combos but with the top down angle you can't tell if you're in the air or not or how close you are to the ground.)This feels a lot like Platinum and Square's attempt at a Souls game. Screwing up even once can lead to death (if you're playing above easy.) Dying forces you to fight your way back to your body or lose your chips (equipment), you can see other player's bodies everywhere and can either obtain a random chip from them or temporarily turn them into an NPC to help you fight. It's no Dark Souls 1, but at least it's no Dark Souls 2			"

												I like the game and think it is worth getting in one form or another. However, I'm ""not recommending"" it because I think it's necessary to present the flaw with the port:-Specs are misleading. I run a 1080 w/16gb ram but this is beyond the rec. People who have the recc specs are having issue with performance-Gameplay is locked at 60fps, cutscene at 30 fps. With a good rig it will stay at 59-60 fps but refer to the spec issue. You can't go above 60-Resolution bug at launch defaults 1080 to upscale internal resolution. There are workarounds but this requires some actual work-DRM using Denuvo, make of that what you will-KB&M setup not recommended. You need a gamepad if you don't want to have a hard time.As a port/pc game it is bad. I would only recommend Automata under following criteria:-If your rig is well beyond the recc specs-If you prefer gamepad over KB&M-If you're ok with locked 60fps-If you want better graphics, perfromance and customization than the PS4-If you don't own a PS4			"

												I spent a long time pondering whether or not to buy this game or not over the past weeks and Im glad that I did! Before starting the review, let me just recommend playing with a controller (Im playing with a 10E one) because it makes gameplay so much more smooth and enjoyable. On another note, I have only completed ending A but felt that just that was worth giving this game a review.Gameplay: amazing combat system in which timing evades is a central concept and something that isnt always easy. It feels abit like skyrim mixed with assassins creed; i.e hack and slash with dodges and counters. However this is not all there is to it, different scenarios call for different approaches; ranged or melee....or why not  both? The combat was seamless and fluid, every hit feels good. Furthermore, the blend of 2d platformer, alien invaders and the ""from above"" diablo perspective at the perfect times in the game really did it for me (if youre not into that, fret not! the vast majority is from the 3rd person 3d perspective)! Last but not least, the BOSS FIGHTS are fantastic, and due to the limited ""save game"" feature of this game, these fights will have your heart pounding as youre on your last legs with no more restores, cause if you die, you are gonna be starting that fight over!Visuals: Im using a gtx 970 and thus far I am having no issues at 1080p. in the beginning the world is very dull, with mostly greyish buildings and some greenery...kinda bland. However this personally made me appreciate colours more, and I can tell you that when you do encounter more vivid scenery, it will be all the more special! Also, it is worth mentioning that the scenery is very well adapted to the story and feelings that they want from you. the player.  Story: now as I mentioned, I have only played the fist ending but wanted to review it anyway. The story is very interesting, deep and explores alot of interesting themes; everything from machines having a family to religion. It also had me questioning several times who the real villain is, the machines or me. Many moments are emotionally touching aswelll but I wont reveal any of that bc its better that you experience that for yourself ;)   On the final note I would like to say that just because this game has several storylines DOES NOT mean you are doing the same thing over and over, it is in no way the same thing as ""grinding"" in other RPG games. It shows you the story from another perspective and you get deeper and deeper into the story and learn new things. So the game doesnt end aftet the first playthrough and it is definately worth the additional playthroughs!Sorry for the long review, hope this helped somebody! :)peace.			"

Right now, I'm going to give you guys a quick rundown.Pros+Open World+Great story+Phenominal Soundtrack wtih Emi Evans+Great replayability (You get multiple routes, and each route tells another character's pov with new sidequests added, etc)+ Probably the best combat an action RPG has to offer+ 2B's behind, for those who are into android assets+ Lots of sidequests, and most of them are very meaningful with a story behind themCons+ Graphics are meh for a current gen game+ Sometimes the world is a bit too empty. + Port optimization could be done a bit better+ Cutscenes run rather slow and choppyThat's my quick review. As far as the combat goes, I'll rate the combat as better than Metal Gear Rising's, but still weaker than Bayonetta 2's.			"

												Combat is great and fast-paced; mixing hack n' slash with bullet hell helps keep the battles interesting and challenging. The soundtrack is amazing, it's daunting when it needs to be and peaceful when it needs to be. The characters are extremely nimble and can traverse the open world with ease and grace and it just gives you this feeling of freedom. The story is engaging and confusing at the same time, so it keeps your interested. Oh, and the protagonist 2B swipes away at the camera if you look up her skirt for too long. That sweet sweet ♥♥♥ compliments this sweet sweet game.Port could be better though.			"

												Yoko Taro does it again! I cannot recommend this game for its story enough. With cutting edge combat from Platinum games and now with more 200% more emotional turmoil than before. PC version has a bit of issues for some unlucky few, so I have to recommend this game without regards to those who experience issues playing it. You'll definitely change some part of you after playing this game. Whether it be subtle or not, there are so absolutely heart wrenching moments you'll never forget. The soundtrack is phenomenal just like the last game and supports and stylizes the story and the combat equally.Play this game and you'll find yourself scouring the internet for lore for days to fill that hole that was created after getting all the main endings. Nier: Automata is the pinnacle of rich story through a video game.			"

												Tech Performance Details:I own both the PS4 Slim and PC edition, and wanted to share some experiences with performance comparing the two.PC Rig: i7-3930K / 32gb Ram / 980TiIn full screen it runs at 900p, using the windowless hack it can run at my screen's native 1440p, but it causes jitter issues. Even though it has the same resolution as the PS4 version, it still looks a little nicer due to better AA, filtering, shadows and shader effects. 60fps lock doesn't bother me as my screen cannot handle any higher anyway. The PC version holds the 60fps nearly perfectly. Much better than the PS4 version anyway. My PC has the same cut scene frame drop issues others have reported. Over 10 hours on the PC version and not a single crash or freeze. There have been a few camera glitches, but the PS4 version has had some too. Overall, I don't think it's a terrible port. There's a few issues with it, but it still looks and plays better than the PS4 version at least on my rig. I do hope that patches unlock the resolution though.-- Actual Game Review --Starting Adventure:I killed a robot the size of an oil rig. Arrived in a city where I jumped straight off a tall building not thinking about fall damage. Just survived the fall, and then a moose came up and finished me off. All this game needs is great characters with futuristic gothic lolita clothing and it'd be perfect...Gameplay:A game that doesn't necessarily do anything original, but takes some great elements from many others and glues them all together in a surprisingly coherent way. There's a little bit if variety with side scrollers, bullet hells and of course, high speed hack 'n' slash. Really responsive controls with a brilliant free-flowing combo system make for one of the best combat games I've ever played. The attention paid to character movement is fantastic and makes all the excessively long jaunts around the world quite enjoyable.Difficulty:Normal mode. Pretty easy actually. This isn't a complaint though. It's fun to just sit back and unwind and get into that lovely combo groove. Most problems are generally caused by stupid mistakes or not learning the mechanics properly. If a harder time is wanted then there are two more difficulties above that. Maybe more, don't know as I'm trying to avoid potential spoilers.Story:No spoilers. So far, really good. It has a more dire tone is general, but then features the usual quirky and silly elements blended in. Due to the main tone though, the silly elements can often feel a little more disturbing which is a great addition.Graphics:Massive fan of the art style. Great costumes, environments and colour palettes. 2B's animation deserve special note as well. Beautiful weight and response to the environment around her. The best illustration of this is attack once with a staff weapon and wait for her sheathing animation. Just beautiful.As for technical achievements, it is damned impressive. Nice skin shaders and cloth physics. Excellent environmental draw distance, but characters and props do suffer from noticeable popup. Some textures are a little low res, so they stand out a little. Same with some NPC models.Sound:This is a real strong point for Nier. The soundtrack is nothing short of gorgeous, with it's mix of instrumental and vocal tracks. The use of multi-track fades makes it even more enjoyable as the music changes to fit the environment and action. Massive credit needs to be given for the use of stereo imaging on the soundtrack, something that very few games seem to even attempt, let alone do well. Wasn't a huge fan of 2B's English voice, so switched to the Japanese track which feels a lot more appropriate given her design and personality. Thank you for keeping that option available. The Japanese dub has been really good in general.The sound effects are also outstanding with really nice positional audio and great filters for reverbs when needed. The text dialogue typing noise is a little grating, but I have that problem with most games.Conclusion:A really nice game that really deserves a try. The only reason to not play this game is if you really dislike hack 'n' slahes. If you feel a game needs to run at the highest resolution with the fastest frame rates to warrant consideration, wait it out for now.			"

												The combat is fun.  Hack n slash is back, and finally on the PC.I didn't realize how ""Japanese"" this game feels.  And that's awesome.  It makes me want to fill myself with all things Japan after experiencing this game.I have a GTX 1070 and the game runs at maximum at 1080p no problems at all.I wish there was a little more ""color"" in the game sometimes.I there are casual games, and then there are niche games which require more skill.  This is definitely not a casual game.  It's refined and detailed.  A lot of modern games have close angles and the character takes up a lot of screen real estate.  With this game the camera changes a bit more than regular 3rd person games. Sometimes the character is so tiny that I'm controlling.  And I love that.  It's artistic and used properly when done.Pros+ Deep story+ Combat+ Runs well for meCons- Invisible walls - No auto save- Learning curve			"

												System Specsi7-4790kGTX 980ti 16gigs RAMWindows 8.1PerformanceAbout 5 hours into it and no performance or graphics glitches. Whatever is causing the odd 1080 fullscreen bug isn't effecting me. I'm running V-sync on but AA off, i haven't tried it with AA on since it looks fine without so i can't give any info on that. The framerate is capped at 60fps and the cut-scenes are capped at 30fps, there is minor stuttering when the framerate drops to render a cut-scene but it's short and doesn't effect much aside from being noticable. No crashes to report so far. (i'll update if any of that changes).StoryIf you've played a Taro game you already know what you're in for so i won't bore you with details and if you're new to his style of story telling i won't spoil it for you other then to say there's multiple endings so don't stop playing just because you've made it to the first set of end credits, infact, the best plot lines usually happen on the second or third playthrough. VisualsThey look better then the first Nier but they're a bit crude by modern game standards but it's first and foremost a RPG and by that measure it looks good. They balanced the wash of browns and greys with the occasional splash of color and it has good special effects and they even gave some of the characters jiggle physics in just the right places as well as other items such as clothing and weapon hangers, overall simple but very nice looking. The weapon effects can be a bit overwhelming at times and you may get lost in a large crowd of enemies with all the explosions and sparks flying everywhere. Overall, it looks great. No weird or badly done textures or meshes, it all look uniform and detailed to a point you'll be immersed in the gameplay in no time. Sounds and musicHaunting and epic music are standard for a Taro game and this is no different, you can adjust all the major sound effects such as music, voice, and effects all seperate.Weapon combat and other Misc sounds are well done.CameraSo far it's been a bit annoying for me to keep it tracking properly on M&K so i switched to a PS3 controller and it feels much better. However, there's more options to finely tune the camera in every way you can imagine and probably in some you never though you needed, if anything it's a bit overwhelming just how many fine tuning option for the camera there are. CombatMUCH improved over previous titles. Fast, frantic, and the enemies are actually good at fighting. I found myself in an area where the enemies were 3X my level and i gave a good fight but got plastered to the floor a good 7 times before i finally gave up and moved on (for now). I lost a few upgrade chips but learned a valuable lesson in humility. It's good solid real-time combat and watching someone else playing doesn't do it justice, it's much more fun and difficult when you're doing it yourself. I like it. Unless the performance suddenly goes south later on I'm keeping my review firmly in the recommend. I've played all the previous titles so i have a good idea what I'm in for plot-wise and the performance of the game itself has been some of the best of any PC game I've bought in a solid 2 years, the 30 fps cap on cut-scenes does make me grimace a little but I'm willing to live with it since it's a minor complaint at worst and me just being a bit of a PC gaming snob at best. If you're into RPG's and Sci-fi plots with bizzare twists that will leave you at a loss for words then have i got a game recommendation for you, swords, smexy female andriods, killer robots the size of small cities, and a plot so crazy that even after playing the entire Drakengard series i still don't understand, it's crazy and I'd want it no other way.

												So, just finished the first Route of this game. Going into 9s's game. Right now, I'm going to give you guys a quick rundown.Pros+Open World+Great story+Phenominal Soundtrack wtih Emi Evans+Great replayability (You get multiple routes, and each route tells another character's pov with new sidequests added, etc)+ Probably the best combat an action RPG has to offer+ 2B's behind, for those who are into android assets+ Lots of sidequests, and most of them are very meaningful with a story behind themCons+ Graphics are meh for a current gen game+ Sometimes the world is a bit too empty. + Port optimization could be done a bit better+ Cutscenes run rather slow and choppyThat's my quick review. As far as the combat goes, I'll rate the combat as better than Metal Gear Rising's, but still weaker than Bayonetta 2's.			"

												9/10Great graphics, fantastic play, amazing story. GRAPHICS: Fullscreen mode is weird right now, only because it will pop back into window mode if background apps get crazy. I fixed the issue for myself, and you can too if you have technical experience. I am running a 980ti, intel 4650k DC, and 32gb RAM. No issues have happened to me yet. A few stutters when I happen upon the bodies of dead players, but that's attributed to the network and not the actual game. If I turn off the network connection, the game runs flawlessly on all highest settings and in 1080p. Never once have I had below 55fps, even with hundreds of enemies on screen.For those of you posting bad reviews due to technical issues: this is a 2017 game. Running it with 6GB RAM on a GTX700 card from 2012 is NOT recommended. This is why you have issues. Upgrade to a newer card and RAM set before playing new games on ultra.GAMEPLAY: This game will take you through a lot of different play styles from RPG action, to hack and slash, to Dark Souls esque timing fighting, to platforming and to top down shooting. Its an awesome ride.STORY: This has one of the most thoughtful story lines I have ever played or seen play out in a video game. You will cry. If this was a movie, it would get awards for screenplay and writing.			"

But discovered a fine crafted story, interesting characters and a complex world build, which makes everything you do important and with meaning. There are still some issues with the port, considering this game was made firstly for the PS4, so it does not run very smoothly on PC, there are still some optimization issues, framerates drops in cutscenes and some artifacts here and there. Fortunately, the game runs for me at 60fps when actually playing and fighting.The game looks and sounds really good, specially the soundtrack.Really intrigued with the story and the terrific world build.Highly recommend it.

												This is truly one of the greatest games I've ever played. The story, combat and soundtrack all work to create an experience that I've rarely seen before. This is a great example as to why video games can create art unlike any other media. In terms of performance, I haven't had any real issue running the game. The game only crashed once in my near 30 hours so far. I've been running in windowed mode at 3440x1440 on a 1080ti with an i7 4790k and it runs locked at 60fps on max settings. Also, nice to see some proper 21:9 support. In short, it's a perfect blend of PlatinumGames Combat and Square RPG Elements.

												System Specsi7-4790kGTX 980ti 16gigs RAMWindows 8.1PerformanceAbout 5 hours into it and no performance or graphics glitches. Whatever is causing the odd 1080 fullscreen bug isn't effecting me. I'm running V-sync on but AA off, i haven't tried it with AA on since it looks fine without so i can't give any info on that. The framerate is capped at 60fps and the cut-scenes are capped at 30fps, there is minor stuttering when the framerate drops to render a cut-scene but it's short and doesn't effect much aside from being noticable. No crashes to report so far. (i'll update if any of that changes).StoryIf you've played a Taro game you already know what you're in for so i won't bore you with details and if you're new to his style of story telling i won't spoil it for you other then to say there's multiple endings so don't stop playing just because you've made it to the first set of end credits, infact, the best plot lines usually happen on the second or third playthrough. VisualsThey look better then the first Nier but they're a bit crude by modern game standards but it's first and foremost a RPG and by that measure it looks good. They balanced the wash of browns and greys with the occasional splash of color and it has good special effects and they even gave some of the characters jiggle physics in just the right places as well as other items such as clothing and weapon hangers, overall simple but very nice looking. The weapon effects can be a bit overwhelming at times and you may get lost in a large crowd of enemies with all the explosions and sparks flying everywhere. Overall, it looks great. No weird or badly done textures or meshes, it all look uniform and detailed to a point you'll be immersed in the gameplay in no time. Sounds and musicHaunting and epic music are standard for a Taro game and this is no different, you can adjust all the major sound effects such as music, voice, and effects all seperate.Weapon combat and other Misc sounds are well done.CameraSo far it's been a bit annoying for me to keep it tracking properly on M&K so i switched to a PS3 controller and it feels much better. However, there's more options to finely tune the camera in every way you can imagine and probably in some you never though you needed, if anything it's a bit overwhelming just how many fine tuning option for the camera there are. CombatMUCH improved over previous titles. Fast, frantic, and the enemies are actually good at fighting. I found myself in an area where the enemies were 3X my level and i gave a good fight but got plastered to the floor a good 7 times before i finally gave up and moved on (for now). I lost a few upgrade chips but learned a valuable lesson in humility. It's good solid real-time combat and watching someone else playing doesn't do it justice, it's much more fun and difficult when you're doing it yourself. I like it. Unless the performance suddenly goes south later on I'm keeping my review firmly in the recommend. I've played all the previous titles so i have a good idea what I'm in for plot-wise and the performance of the game itself has been some of the best of any PC game I've bought in a solid 2 years, the 30 fps cap on cut-scenes does make me grimace a little but I'm willing to live with it since it's a minor complaint at worst and me just being a bit of a PC gaming snob at best. If you're into RPG's and Sci-fi plots with bizzare twists that will leave you at a loss for words then have i got a game recommendation for you, swords, smexy female andriods, killer robots the size of small cities, and a plot so crazy that even after playing the entire Drakengard series i still don't understand, it's crazy and I'd want it no other way.

												Although I sympathize, I can't comment on performance issues because I never encountered any. The game ran smoothly on my setup [i5 4960K, GTX 1070 EX, 8GB Kingston HyperX DDR3]. I'm reading most people encounter issues on a GTX 700 series or earlier model GPU. Someone pointed out that fullscreen doesn't give full 1080p resolution, but it never bothered me after I noticed it.For the game, on a first playthrough it is a good game but the lack of story explanation and backstory threw me off. Then I realized that you unlock more backstory on a second playthrough. Having this second playthrough and replaying the scenarios gave me a much greater feel for the setting of the game and the emotions/driven ambitions of the main characters. Furthermore, the second playthrough didn't feel like a drag whatsoever for me because the combat is immensively fun and the story is just different enough to feel like a somewhat new experience. Then the third playthrough is when everything changes, it unlocks the second half of the game, and it caught me entirely off gaurd. I loved it, it feels like a complete and well structured game with a very nihilistic approach in story telling. The characters are well understood near the end and how they develop at this point is very satisfying. Along with the story, the game also very fun to play. If can be challenging (but fun) if you set up the appropriate difficulty setting for you. The combat feels smooth and nice. It's simple, but there are so many subtle ways to combine abilities and button commands that I felt I was still learning new combat techniques and getting progressively better even on the second and third playthrough. It's dynamic and there is flexibility for the gamer to fight how they want and still learn more.  I love this game, and I recommend giving it a chance through all the playthroughs.			"

This game involves the players in a way I have never seen before get  you the player ask yourself some serious question character development is well done you get closers and closers to most characters in the story , as you get to play in there point of view.  As for the replayability well I finished all the main endings and yet everytime I sit in front of my computer I cant help but click this game and play again.  WITHOUT  a doubt the best game of 2017 so far payed 80 $ for the game and I feel like I litterally robbed it worth every penny which is rare these days a real work of art and how games should be. It  sets the bar high for upcoming games this years.  9.5 /10   the 0.5 is only because of somebug you may encounter like screen freeze. I will I buy a sequel if there is one ? Yes the game made a great impression on me .Buy it play it worth it			"

												I have never heard or played any of the games that came before this one and only found out about it a week before it launched on the PC.  All I can say is WOW!  This game has left me speechless so many times.  The only thing I can compare it too is watching your fav tv show and wanting to know what happens next!  Nier Automata pleasantly surprises me over and over again.  The story is sad and engaging and I am currently on my 3rd ""play through"" and cant wait to see how everything finishes.The game play took me a bit of getting used to as I am not used to playing this style of game, but I love it!  Its simple but fun, and once you get the hang of it the combat is a blast!  The giant boss fights are great!The sound track is amazing; it really pulls on my heart strings from time to time lol.If you are on the fence about this game just do yourself a favour a get it!  9/10 for me.This just in, holy ♥♥♥♥!  I finished the final ending last night and the decision you get to make after you go through the credits blew my mind!   Best game ever! 11/10			"

That being said getting through that section wasn't smooth and the FPS was very low the entire time.

												Do not read anything about this game or any reviews just buy it and play it. It has easily 30 hours of content without side quests and loads of secrets. A really interesting story that will have you asking questions on the edge of your seat and really enjoyable combat.

												I have not played the other titles by this dev. I found this game to be remarkably engaging. The music is excellent and really sets the tone; the dialog, particularly the side quests (but also the voiced dialog) is rather 'deep' for a video game. Combat is fluid without hitching and the animation quality is high. I have not had any technical issues with the game and play at 4K with all settings maxed. Texture resolutions at 4K don't hold up under scrutiny, however. It is clear that it is an unsupported resolution.			"

												Welp, I completed it. The ending kind of creeps up. I was hoping for a bit more out of a single playthrough but I am reading that the gimmicky deal for this game is the multiple playthroughs. So, I guess I'll be jumping back in. The combat is pretty impeccable. It's certainly not the most complex character action title I've played but it's satisfying. No, it's not God of War simple but it certainly isn't DMC3.          The biggest, glaring problem in the room has previously been stated. It has some port issues but nothing that couldn't be fixed. But I beat this game in a wee two sittings. I guess that could be a compliment because I wasn't bored for a second but it feels like I wasn't given enough time to approach bored. Maybe not even enough time to approach the Platinum Climax...(sqerm joke). Just be warned, it won't be one of those $1/hr kind of games if that's usually how you operate. Personally, I will be logging more time in. I want to know how much content has been hidden from my first timer eyes. Oh, and 2B is really, really, unbearably, overthetop hot. Enjoy the Doujin.			"

												Loving the game so far. Some points I want to make:- 4K is only an upscale. Any other resolution is fine. Quite disappointed as I always play at 4K, but probably won't affect the majority of players.- For the first hour, was playing on 4K and the frames froze 3 times while upscaled. Playing at 1440p eliminated the frame freezes. - Not many graphical options. Options that can be changed include: AA, Texture Filter, Blur, Shadows, Effects, Ambient Occlusion. However, not very surprised at this as it's a port from a console.- Haven't tried using a keyboard yet, but definitely recommend using a controler. I'm sometimes pressing 3 - 4 buttons at once or in quick succession.- Soundtrack is definitely up there with the best.All in all, I haven't encountered any other problems besides the infrequent freezing on an upscaled 4K, and is an extremely fun game with, as expected, a really good soundtrack.

												I have never heard or played any of the games that came before this one and only found out about it a week before it launched on the PC.  All I can say is WOW!  This game has left me speechless so many times.  The only thing I can compare it too is watching your fav tv show and wanting to know what happens next!  Nier Automata pleasantly surprises me over and over again.  The story is sad and engaging and I am currently on my 3rd ""play through"" and cant wait to see how everything finishes.The game play took me a bit of getting used to as I am not used to playing this style of game, but I love it!  Its simple but fun, and once you get the hang of it the combat is a blast!  The giant boss fights are great!The sound track is amazing; it really pulls on my heart strings from time to time lol.If you are on the fence about this game just do yourself a favour a get it!  9/10 for me.This just in, holy ♥♥♥♥!  I finished the final ending last night and the decision you get to make after you go through the credits blew my mind!   Best game ever! 11/10			"

												Ok so the reason I can't recommend it is the fact that I can't play it smoothly at all. At first I thought it was my PC but it runs other games just fine and it has the recommened specs. I was able to get through the first section of the intro with the flying but only with the PC unplugged becuase for some reason the FPS drops even lower with my laptop plugged in. That being said getting through that section wasn't smooth and the FPS was very low the entire time. Then when I got to the on the ground section the FPS dropped even more and it was unplayable when it was unplugged as well. Then my laptop died. Point is I'm pretty sure this is a game issue and I hope it gets fixed because I want to leave a good review.			"

												tl;dr: If care about writing and story, characterization then wait for a sale. If you just want to hack and slash through enemies with satisfying gameplay, and some great set pieces then by all means go buy it. I would highly recommend it for that reason alone.Edit: I understand that the story gets better through the second and onward playthroughs but my argument stands that if the game cannot grip you in the first playthrough (in which they think we'll actually care about anything because of the poor characterization) if we want to continue playing with a forward thinking mind.The combat is fun and good. It's what platinum game does best. However, while the game runs and plays great, the actual content of the game isn't good. The game forces you to play through the game multiple times just to get a decent story because honestly the first playthrough does not bode well in characterization, story narrative and discards a few plotlines along the way. It doesn't even compare to it's parent game, Drakengard, specifically 1 and 2.The main antagonists have a surprising assertion into the story but that's all the time they're given. You never get to know them, what they're thinking as you play the game. Once you reach certain story bits, they show up and you kill them. That's it. There's an interesting lore to behold in Nier Automata but it's disregarded for philosophical talk about ""androids...machines...emotions...not so different..etc"". It's cliche. 2B is just as bad. You never get to know her. Sure you know that she listens to HQ but that's HQ's opinion and orders on things. She never has her own opinions that really drive the story. She doesn't assert herself as one of the main characters. 9S does most of the talking and so he has a little more character but it needs 2B's cooporation in order for both of them to grow to the potential they have. And there's not much to elaborate on other side characters because while some may seem important you'll never really get to know them as much as you want. But all in all, the game doesn't ever set things up to really get to know anyone. It's just ""we got orders for this...orders for that...""Some side quests will automatically fail without any warning if you progress in the story. And the side quests for the most part are simply just for materials and gold. It doesn't offer anything special to the world other than some subtle characters of the npcs.And before I knew it the game just ended...like seriously...? That was the ending? Are you ♥♥♥♥ing serious? And you're gonna say I have to play the game again just to get the story experience that was deliberately missing from the first playthrough?? That's not how you do it if you are giving players such a weak first playthrough experience. Give us something strong to hold onto....and then we can move forward onto multiple playthroughs..but Nier Automata thinks this is a cool way to tell story by chopping it into pieces forcing you to play hours upon hours of the same content just to get a decent story.In my opinion, all those 9/10s from game outlets hyped the ♥♥♥♥ out of me and it honestly hurts that I feel so different from it. The first game I ever bought was Drakengard 2. It was my first taste with the franchise And I loved it. The characters and story were there. The english voice acting were ♥♥♥♥ing good too. Then I played 1 and it was my first taste with Yoko Taro's vision. Nier Automata .....disappointing really. Though the soundtrack is amazing again and again. This is still a decent game for pure unadulterated gameplay alone. Which ultimately saves Nier Automata.			"

It's hard to describe what makes this game so great but it filled a void I didn't even know I was missing in games.  I urge everyone to get this game.The start of the game threw me off.  Even though it warns that the game doesn't auto save I still didn't expect to have to start over when I died on the first boss.  So be warned (again) to save.  Once you get past the opening scenes there are places to save all over the world. "

You can have a great system set in place, but many times after say, at least 30 hours into the game, you start to feel something ""wrong"" about it. NOT THIS GAME.Music - P E R F E C T. The tiny details in the music swap in different zones, the IMPACT that is delivered in supposed epic scenes, the sadness that is seeped into your heart in the piano/violin. It's not just about having the right music, it's about having right music at the RIGHT TIME.  "

												NieR: Automata™ is one of the biggest surprises on the year and one hell of a game. It offers a diverse variety of genres in a well-designed title with fluid and dynamic controls and fast-paced action that never stops. Fun and refreshing, looks and plays just like a good made mix of a Devil May Cry game's combat with Final Fantasy JRPG elements in a Final Fantasy game setting and story (Although it's a VERY dark story).On top of that, its full and rich cast of characters and well-set story makes this one of the most interesting games of 2017 and a game that no one should miss out on. A title well deserving of being one of my personal Games of the Year!			"

												It is not often I am surprised when playing games. Even less so when I go into a game with no expectations at all but is blown away at the sheer quality that exists in the game. NieR:Automata does both of these things, and have so far easily provided me with over 40 hours of entertainment (of which some included quite the frustration).There's not a lot one can say about the game that spoils it, but if you love fluid combat, hack-n-slash, interesting story, New Game+ as well as multiple routes then buy this game and play it. It will most likely not let you down. Just remember to Dash/Evade often and even the most challenging fights will be possible to overcome.Just a few minor notes that are important to mention:- Remember to save often.- A controller is highly recommended.- Dashing/evading doesn't require precise timing.- The unskippable and checkpoint-less prologue is notoriously hard. Remember to dash/evade and take your time. If the prologue is too hard, don't be afraid to lower the difficulty to Easy. You won't lose anything and you can set the difficulty up to Normal after the prologue is complete.- The PC port currently (2017-03-25) experiences a white screen occasionally when the game engine crashes. No community fixes exists yet that solves this to 100%. Hopefully the developers will patch this soon enough.- Use the FAR mod/patch/fix by Kaldaien (see the Steam forums for the game). This fixes fullscreen resolution scaling as well as allows users to lower a graphic setting in the game that tanks the performance on most builds.- Replay the game! The first credit text is only the beginning...			"

												So... NieR:Automata, also known as 2Butt: The Game. This is a game about a female android with an butt that me and half the Internets would tap all day, erry day, twice on Sundays. When you play this game, listen very carefully and delight in the screams and tears of thousands of femnazis and SJWs as they collectively get told by 'The Man' Yoko Taro exactly what they can do with their opinions. After you play this game, remember to collect the weekly zip of more 2B butt so you don't have to go a further moment without that sweet, sweet butt. Remember to vote 2B for Butt of the Year, All Years(tm) too.Oh, and uh, she apparently has a sword and goes around cutting up these other tin can trash robots while they're trying to have sex... not sure why. Not that it matters however... There's a plot here somewhere, probably involving butt.Wait... It doesn't? What do you mean it... well... That's DUMB! Or is this the so-called often lauded OMG CONTROVERSY!!! I hear about in gaming nowadays? Either way, not sure it's needed... This game already has plenty of controversy! Like for example, do you tap dat butt or do you bounce coins off of it? I mean, I could bounce coins off dat butt ALL. FREAKING. DAY! Drop 'em from a height of 10 feet and it'd be like *poiiiing*... and you could probably aim it at a jukebox or something if you wanted to be cool!Alternatively, you could just tap it like everyone else would. I like my 2B butt like I like my beer: On tap.Now back to your regularly scheduled butt.Damn, dat butt... I freaking swear, I'd tap dat like Tap of the North Star freaking...Out of 10? Sure! Butt/10			"

												Beat the first playthrough in 15 hoursThe first playthrough was stunning. I haven't played any games by this developer yet (I have played kingdom hearts from this publisher though, which I never finished but it was amazing and do want to finish it some day), and now I'm a fan. The director admitted to not really doing much for the production of this title (he seems like an amazing guy though), so pretty much all the credit goes to Platinum games, and so far I can't think of a thing about this game to change.The story is beautiful so far, which makes me all the more excited to play the second time for the changes, which is a first for me, because usually I end up stopping after the first playthrough even if the second has more changes (granted, however, these are games where the second playthough only offers a little extra). I'm super excited to see what comes next in this series (if there ever will be more(hopefully!!)) and wanna say great job to Platinum games and square enix. :)			"

												This game is amazing!This game is probably my favorite game in the last couple of years. The combat is tight and the effects make it look a whole lot cooler. Everything in the game has an immense amount of detail and care poured into it by the developers. The sound in the game is by far the best thing ive heard this year hands down, the way the music tranitions between locations is seamless and the combat music gets you completely pumped. The first time you play the game you will be amazed but every replay adds soo much more, it answers questions of the previous playthrough but leave more to be answered by the other playthroughs.This game always keeps me entertained and I hope it does the same for you.If you are on the fence on wondering if the game is worth the money, I 100% think that this game is worth the money, even though I thought that the day one edition bonuses are dumb.

												This is one of the greatest games I have played in my entire life, the gameplay is rewarding and relies on your own creativity using combos with wapons abilities and attacks against an everchanging variety of enemies. The soundtrack is absolutely amazing creating an atmosphere that pulls you into the games action sequences as well as relaxing or emotional ones. The story is fairly conveluted but easy to follow the basics of it with some events making you think deeply about certain concepts and have a connection with the characters. The only problems I can see are the requirements of a controller as this game is impossible to paly without one and the game isnt too well optimized but still runs fine with the occasional fps dropThis game is also a sequel in a franchise but does not require prior knowledge to understand but if you are more interested in the events prior to the game this story takes place after the events in the games are Drakengard 3 Drakengard 1 and NieR If you are going to purchase this game DO NOT STOP AFTER THE FIRST PLAYTHROUGH, once you have beaten the game you will be given an option to replay with many differences and extra content. This is fun because many things are different but afterwards the story continues onwards leading into the third and fourth parts.			"

												NieR:Automata did this amazing thing where I was smiling the whole way through. At no point did I feel like I was doing something tedious, nor at any point was I uninterested in what was going on. Each playthrough was unique and fresh. The OST alone made this game worth the purchase. The only flaw is that the port is pretty shoddy, but besides that it's one of the best games I've played this year.			"

												Before I start with this Review to: NieR:Automata, I want you to know that english isnt my first language. If there are some mistakes. Happens.NieR: Automata is a blabla...I am pretty sure you already read the steamentry to it. So I will just focus on what you cant know as someone, who didnt play the game. I have quite the progress already and I will list the pros and cons down here:Cons:Performance: The Performance is not good. Atleast for me. I am pretty sure the frame stuttering and the tearing in cutscenes is not intended. I recommend checking out the system-requirements and be sure that you hat atleast a bit better then ""minimum"". (to be fair, I didnt reduce the resolution so everyone should be fine. But there are some problems in cutscenes and really smoky scenes and stuff.)Open world: This game isnt exaclty ""open world"". You often get blocked by invisible walls or sometimes you also think 2-B is kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. However. ""Can I move about terrain and around the world and stuff?"" ""Yes you can."" Can I go everywhere I want to?"" ""Nope you cant.""Resolution: This is something I dont know really if it is intended or not. But I feel like the game is a but ""blurry"" (?) or something like that. But thats personal. It just feels strange sometimes. Pros:(Holy jesus. There are lots of pros)Soundtrack: The soundtrack is one of the best I have ever heard. Music is personal taste however but the bossfights and all around the world there is just good music. :D2-B and 9-S (The Protagonists):I know, I know. Its pretty standart. The ""tough"" one which just want to do her duty and her job and the other ""sidekick"" who does puns and is for the happy feels in conversations. I just really like how they interact with each other and overall the persons.The Battle-System:There is just one word for it. Fluid and clean as f*ck. It just feels so nice to kick roboters around with katanas. This is something you need to experience yourself or on youtube. For me it is very fun and I like it alot. Is it Repetetiv?If you are used to RPGs I dont think so. The camermovement, the pods and sometimes the mechs. Its a nice all around pack. But remember it is an hack `n slash game. So It can get sometimes boring. (Not for me, but I can imagine that) The Bossfights:One of the biggest pros I have on this list. Holy ♥♥♥♥. The boss battles. The only game which comes ""nier"" to that (kms) is Dark Souls and Final Fantasy. But Nier doesnt need to hide. Especially two bosses at the first 2 hours are amazing. No spoilers here. ^^The Story: I played like 4 hours or something but already got mind♥♥♥♥ed 3-4 times. I am so curious how it will develop itself Oo.2-Bs Butt: Are you suprised? :D (I will continue this review as I progress through the game :))Until here: If you are a fan of RPGs, have a acceptable pc and you like hack n` slash games buy it.

												Now the only reason you might some negative reviews is because of a few launch day bugs/quereys that was quite quickly fixed, for the most part at least. I'm running NierR at the lowest settings and i'm still enjoying the game. I've had a low end pc for a long time and i've gotten used to/not bothered by graphics at all now, and neither should you. The game is a great hack and slash rpg with great a waifu: 2B. I love the combat system in this game and i'm not gonna lie, on pc it might take a little getting used to, but I found myself comfortable with it after the first quest. However, the game does not have a windowed fullscreen mode which is a slight annoyance but a third party program called Borderless Gaming fixed that problem, this may also fix a resolution bug that a couple of people may have. Also note that even though I haven't played the other NieR/Drakengaurd(something like that) I still enjoyed the game. Other than that, its a great game and you should definatly buy :)			"

												Came for the combat, stayed for about everything else.Seriously though, I never played the previous Nier or Drakengard series. Came in expecting to basically play some Metal Waifu Rising and got hit with a wall of completely unexpected depth to the game.The big thing was story for sure. Yoko Taro made it seem like it was Hideo Kojima trying to make a JRPG with this game. Completely blew my expectations, along with even Kojima-ish style moments of the game just screwing with you. Best unexpected gem of a game for me so far this year. Looking forward to future Yoko Taro titles.			"

												Phenomenal game with an amazing story and soundtrack. Gameplay is a ton of fun, though fighting the same enemies with different skins can get a little old after a while. I highly those who are on the fence give the game a try. The major cons are the long load times (when you actually have to load, which isn't often), the reskinned enemy types, how easy the game gets once you've beat the game (there's no enemy scaling, so even on Hard you'll end up 20+ levels higher than the strongest enemies and your only option is Very Hard which is 1-hit = death), and how jarring the 30 fps cutscenes are after 60 fps gameplay.I absolutely love this game despite those issues and can't recommend it enough.

												Loving the game so far. Some points I want to make:- 4K is only an upscale. Any other resolution is fine. Quite disappointed as I always play at 4K, but probably won't affect the majority of players.- For the first hour, was playing on 4K and the frames froze 3 times while upscaled. Playing at 1440p eliminated the frame freezes. - Not many graphical options. Options that can be changed include: AA, Texture Filter, Blur, Shadows, Effects, Ambient Occlusion. However, not very surprised at this as it's a port from a console.- Haven't tried using a keyboard yet, but definitely recommend using a controler. I'm sometimes pressing 3 - 4 buttons at once or in quick succession.- Soundtrack is definitely up there with the best.All in all, I haven't encountered any other problems besides the infrequent freezing on an upscaled 4K, and is an extremely fun game with, as expected, a really good soundtrack.

Combat is smooth, exciting, and engaging.NieR Automata comes so close to becoming a true masterpiece, thanks to its strong personality and the unique vision of Yoko Taro. Technically inadequate, engaging in its deep and ever-changing gameplay, NieR tells a story of robots and androids, and in doing so it tells a lucid, melancholic story of humanity.			"

												For starters I will say that this is a review for the game, which is fantastic, the port on the other hand is awfull. You should not purchase this if you have mid/low end pc and you might have big problems running it with hardware around the min. reguirements. Mods might help you there.Nier: Automata was a experience more than a game... I haven't played any other Nier games before this so I have missed quite a bit referenced here and there but the game is worth it even if you haven't played any Drakengard or Nier game before. Nier: Automata is a philosophical meta game that distracts you with flashy fights and genre bending game mechanics(It's at least Third person shooter, shoot'em'up, rpg, hack and slash, platformer and spectacle fighter)The story is fine but the characters are so fleshed out that I can't believe it.Where Nier: Automata shines truly is how it studies philosophical consepts about metaphysics and purpose. Although you can reach ""happy ending"" in the game it still also embraces the fact that purpose, hope etc. are subjective and some people might find reality dark and hopeless, meaningless. Although everyone can find peace in the end if they want to.			"

												Unlike my other reviews I'm simply at an almost complete loss of words for what to say about this.Despite the port issues, despite combat that while good, can become a slog at times, I can already tell this can likely be my GOTY and 100% in my top 10 games until I die.By all means, this game is a work of art. I'm not typically a person who's too big on the videogames=art thing but, I..I simply do not know how to describe it any other way.A game has never touched me so emotionally and shaken me this much. I got ending E not to long ago (of 26 endings) and I can already tell it's going to be my most fond gaming memory of this year, if not this entire decade.This game should be played at all costs and desevres to be played. You owe it to yourself as a gamer to see this agme through to the end.9/10No game is perfect, and while this game has many personality quirks which will be considered annoying by some, I'm willing to overlook ALL of them to give this game a near perfect score, because I know it's the score this game deserves.

												This is one of the greatest games I have played in my entire life, the gameplay is rewarding and relies on your own creativity using combos with wapons abilities and attacks against an everchanging variety of enemies. The soundtrack is absolutely amazing creating an atmosphere that pulls you into the games action sequences as well as relaxing or emotional ones. The story is fairly conveluted but easy to follow the basics of it with some events making you think deeply about certain concepts and have a connection with the characters. The only problems I can see are the requirements of a controller as this game is impossible to paly without one and the game isnt too well optimized but still runs fine with the occasional fps dropThis game is also a sequel in a franchise but does not require prior knowledge to understand but if you are more interested in the events prior to the game this story takes place after the events in the games are Drakengard 3 Drakengard 1 and NieR If you are going to purchase this game DO NOT STOP AFTER THE FIRST PLAYTHROUGH, once you have beaten the game you will be given an option to replay with many differences and extra content. This is fun because many things are different but afterwards the story continues onwards leading into the third and fourth parts.			"

tl;dr: Buy it now. It's great.Pros:+ Great Story (marry me Yoko Taro)+ Great Music+ Fast Paced Gameplay+ 2B is f*ckin thicc+ High Replay Value (26 Endings, 5 Story Endings)+ Each weapon has different combos (Combat Bracers ftw)+ ~35 hours of gameplay Story only (+ Sidequests)+ Self Destruct to remove 2B's skirtCons:- The Existence of 9S- Crashes with AMD Drivers with ReLive (Use everything before 16.12.1)- Locked at 60fps- Fullscreen bugged (Download Windowed Borderless Gaming to fix)2B(uy) or not 2B(uy):Buy it now. This game offers one of the best Soundtracks I've heard in recent years and the gameplay is top-notch. There may be problems, but you can either fix these by yourself or usa a user-made patch (Pinned in the Steam Forums) so there is no reason not to get it.I would gladly buy the game again at full price and would even say that it's one of the best games I've ever played. Definitely GOTY worthy as soon as the problems are fixed by the developers.Disclaimer: Game Version 06/04/17 "

												Do not buy the PC version of this game. The game can't actually bet set to run at 1920x1080 (or any widescreen resolution for that matter), instead it creates a distorted 4:3 1440x1080 image like early '00s ""anamorphic widescreen"" DVDs. That's in addition to horrible frame pacing where the game will constantly stutter and hitch despite technically running at a 60 frames per second average. Of course you will need a 1000 series nvidia card to even get to that level of awful performance in the first place. Cutscenes also have bizarre problems because somehow the team responsible for this port couldn't even get prerendered video to play back properly.It's worth noting that the above problems only become apparent after you solve the even more glaring issues like ambient occlusion and antialiasing being broken (it's 2017 and apparently Platinum doesn't know what FXAA is).If you want to play Nier, get it on PS4. I've heard the base model PS4 experience isn't stellar either but it cannot possibly be worse than this.Bizarre and disappointing since Platinum's last PC port, Metal Gear Rising was, if not excellent, at least entirely competant.

												This game is worth every single penny.The work and passion that has been put into it is remarkable,fantastic.The soundtrack,the world design,the combat,characters and reveal of the true story of Nier:Automata-every single one of those things is done in an unique way (yes,the combat is hack-and-slash but its animations are the things that are unique to the game,like the dodging for example).I still haven't completed all of the endings,only from A to D,and I shall continue playing this to my heart's content.The only con I can think of is the one that everyone else points out-mediocre PC port,needs some fixing,but so far,it has been good for me.Thank you for creating this absolute masterpiece.One of my most favorite games,I rate it 10/10.Pro tip:Hold the self destruct button!

												So far I havent finished it, but I would say this game is the most interesting thing I have been playing in the last couple of years.The story is odd..in a good japanese anime way.. its overall sad, but filled with humour and warmth.The gameplay is superb.. a bizarre mix of Metl Gear Rising, DMC and ikaruga + rpg elements borrowed from Dark Souls.What makes it work is that everything is so well balanced and polished.The Graphics actually looks much better in motion than on Screenshots thanks to the animations, wind, dust etc..and most of all...The superb lighting and post processing. My only complains so far is that sometimes, is the world map that do rely on narrow passages between zones, although theres no loading time, which do justifies this approach from a technichal perspective.This game might be my first 10...and that says a lot.(yeah ..i know zelda is a 10...but they paid for it :p)			"

												The gameplay is challengeing and fun, and the graphics are decent....DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME WITH A KEYBOARD.  Oh my god, difficulty level multplied by 100 if you don't use a game pad.  CTD, 3d3 error.  When I scaled it to 1920x1080, about two hours into play, the game went black screen, then had a couple errors that were of the 3d3 veriety.  Not sure why this happened....but it sucks when you are a half hour after a savepoint and the game crashes.  Either they need to allow saves anywhere, or figure out what's going on with that.Except for the crash, game runs smoothly except for drop in fps in cutscenes.  I probably wouldn't buy this game until the crashing is fixed....but once that's patched, I def. will change my down vote when that is fixed.SLI GTX 970 (no, game does not support SLI)intel i5 4690k16GB DDR4 ramWindows 10 "

												I've heard only good things about this game for its console release, but so far this seems like a fairly bad PC port.Resolution is upscaled from 900p to your monitors resolution when in fullscreen. There's no way that I can tell to fix this, I guess we have to wait for a hotfix. There is no borderless windowed mode to circumvent this issue. I've seen people saying they're also having weird scaling issues with their game running in 4:3 when set to 1080p.Keyboard + mouse controls are AWFUL. Don't even bother, use a controller. Which leads me to my next point...Only XInput controllers are recognized. This is a port of a PS4 game that doesn't have support for the Dualshock 4. You have to use DS4windows to mimic a 360 controller to play using a DS4. I've heard varying information on the performance, myself not getting past the main menu yet due to the above points. It seems to run fairly well on most high end systems. Note: I know I could use a program to force borderless windowed. But a game should not ship in a state where it requires a third-party application to run it in one of if not the most common resolutions on the market.If these problems don't bother you, the game itself is fantastic. Just read any reviews for the PS4 version. These issues can be circumvented with third-party apps like I said, but I myself find the need for apps to get basic functions working indicitave of lazy developers/porters. If they fix these issues, I won't hesitate to enjoy the game.			"

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME YET.It's 2017, for ♥♥♥♥'s sake. The PC community has voiced how frustrated they are with the pathetic ports so many times now, and companies still manage to ♥♥♥♥ things up this badly. It's pathetic.I was so excited for this game, and when it finally came out on PC, I booted it up, played a bit and closed it, since I was focusing more on how angry I was at this terribly flawed port than on the experience the game was trying to provide.I've faced a few unacceptable problems in the few minutes that I've spend playing this poor excuse for a port:- There are plenty of resolution options, but as soon as you choose fullscreen, the game goes ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and locks its internal rendering resolution to something like 1600x900 (or maybe even less), playing it windowed fixes it, but it's not something I want to look for 3rd party software to fix, since it's a simple configuration that is very much expected to work flawlessly;- Every single time I press or hold anything on the controller, a mouse cursor pops up in the middle of the screen, as if the game is forcing KB+M configuration at any given moment, further proven by the fact that the control scheme shown is that of a KB+M config, attempting to show me controller configurations whenever I held any button, but alternating quickly between that and keyboard buttons;- Cutscenes have sort of transparent black boxes on the top and bottom of the screen. I'm not sure if this is an intended design decision or poor porting of a ""cutscene overlay"", but given how some very pathetic things actually went through, I'm not doubting it's just another bug.I am not playing this game any further and will keep my negative recommendation until I see a patch that properly fixes those issues and makes the game flawlessly playable, as it should have been from release. In case we, the paying customers, don't get the product we deserve and paid for in a timely fashion, I'm refunding immediately.			"

												An amazing game filled with the potential of being a masterpiece. However, like other SE games, Nier comes with the badge of being unfinished and broken. Thankfully the story of this game makes a fascinating plot that uses a quirky way of expanding the limited content of characters, bosses and the world itself in way that extends the game's playtime narratively, as well as changes to the game-play for better or worse. The fashion of how the story is conveyed creates an experience most unlike other games on the market today, an experience that I highly recommend - unlike most Square Enix games. Because of that, I highly recommend waiting for a patch or acquiring the console version due to the PC version being inferior due to bugs, or simply for the negligence of porting the PS4 version to PC and not the PS4 Pro version of Nier. Nier Automata’s cut-scenes are rendered at 900p / 30 frames per second on PC, while on PS4 pro they run at 1080p / 60 FPS. An issue that forces the game to run in different resolutions despite the selected choices in the options menu. However if you run the game in windowed mode, the resolution with be correctly displayed -- in window mode. Third-party fixes are available, which allow borderless window mode. After just finding out a lot of these issue after some decent play-time, I'm a lil' dishearten'd with not being able to leave a full recommendation. Thankfully the game is still playable, enjoyable.			"

												I want to start off by saying this game is a very fun concept, I love the idea behind the bullet hell, hack n slash, rpg action game it is. It was fun to start off on Hard, fight some enemies that can 2-3 shot, feel good while dodging, pulling off stylish combos enjoying it for the melee/ranged gameplay it is, much like Bayonetta or DMC. Then it happened. The game just starts one shotting you, now you may say, well that makes the game hard, and it is hard get good scrub etc. I have played every Dark Souls, BloodBorne, Demon's Souls, and many other games considered hard, and very challenging, I've never had problems in those games, because it was fair and challenging, you can learn adapt, play better. This game isn't that, I never had any trouble in hard in this game either, rather, the game just became extremely boring to play. You will end up spamming dodge constantly, rarely getting your licks in with your melee attacks, rather, you will dodge dodge dodge dodge then proceed to shoot them and maybe attack 1-2 times, never really risking the reward of your melee attacks because dying is just frustrating. This was the game for me, I was on hard, it was enjoyable, then it turned into a mess, so I said okay this is just BORING, straight BORING, I'm not really dying to being ""bad"" rather being impatient and simply bored so I go to attack and dead, so fine I'll just spam shots.So I changed to normal, normal was just as boring because enemies died so fast, so easily, it was not even worth comboing them, just detroying them quickly with a skill and the same thing basically happens, I end up bored. Beyond bored, so bored of ""hard"" which should be thrilling and turned it down to ""normal"" to which it was just boring because there was no thrill. There in lies the problem with this game, it is simply boring, the combat is fun, WHEN enemies get stunned and you can actually use it the way as intended. When they don't get stunned, it devolves into a bland repetitive experience where you attack 1-2 times, dodge attack 1 time, dodge attack 1 time dodge, all while holding down your auto attack.Extremely disappointing, the music is fantastic, the animations are amazing, honestly, if you own this game, just attack one time, watch 2b, 9s, a2 recover, it is great, the life they add to the character when they are done with their aerial ground slam, or their 1-2-3-4-5-6 hit combo, it feels great, they don't go back to there normal stance, rather, they slowly recover back into their normal stance. It looks and feels great when you play it. The music gets you hyped for the fight to come, the amusement park theme was one of my favorite because it just felt great to fight in that arena with that music, superb. But, all this is meaningless if I can't hold my own to continue to play because of boredom. The boss fights are fantastic too, playing a bullet hell while then playing a minigame while fighting is great, it flows well, it feels good and all that, in fact, the boss fights are the one thing I am okay in dying in 1 hit and recommending you switch to very hard/ hard on.This game is not bad by any means, in fact, I just don't think it is very fun. If you enjoy the old Nier game, or Drakengard, I am sure you will like this game as the combat is better, but for a game, it is bland and boring and I just can't really accept it as what it is and enjoy it.

												I was very hyped for this game, and I will keep playing it, however I dont think the game is worth of 60 euros.Basic checklistPros:- Combat is amazing- Animations are top notch- Character models are great also- Japanese voice acting is good- Camera position changes are amazing- If you die, you have to retrieve it - Interactions with other players bodies- Boss battlesAnd then the cons, a lot of these are in a lot of JRPG's which is shame.Cons:- Mundane side-quests (Fetch this, get 5 of this, escort this.)- Map is very barren and copy paste everywhere.- Tons of invisible walls.- Lot's of running at start of the game, alter you unlock teleport between savepoints.- No autosave.- Tons of different kind of materials and most of make no sense. Why do I need moose meat to upgrade my weapons?- Graphically enviorement is low quality.- 2B, flat chested bad-♥♥♥ emotioneless android, very used anime trope.- So far (6 hours in) story is nothing to praise about. Might change later.- NPC's personalities are flat.- Non boss combat either you kick enemies ♥♥♥ 100% or you get cheapily stunlocked- Tons of different healing and boost items, good luck navigating them.While yes, I love the combat of this game, its nice when playing in short bursts.If you think pros outweight cons, feel free to grab the game.If you don't wait for a sale some sort, its nowhere near full price on my opinion.

												Yoko Taro and Platinum are back with a masterpiece!This one is a weird one, the gameplay its really good, its mainly hack/slash with rpg elements and mixes a ton of genres in some points of the game, it changes to sidescroller, sidescroll shooter, metroidvania, dungeon crawler and more.The story is weird, but a great one, mixes a lot of serious philosophical things about life and weird Japanese stuff and humor, the soundtrack its just beautiful and epic and the graphics are okay but the word and characters have a great designYeah the game is awesome, gameplay, story, and soundtrack! But... the port its ok with some graphics options, its running a 60fps, having some issues at the cutscenes (30fps) with some weird slowdown, the view distance its awful have a lot of popin. Outside of that its running fine for me (i7-6700k, gtx 1070, 16gb ram) but i heard for some people is having some issues with the fullscreen and the framerate.At this point this kind of hurts me but i cant recommend it for pc at fullprice thanks to the port issues, but if you can get around this issues or get it for ps4 pro or on sale price is a must buy!pd: i really love the game but i dont want to support bad ports on release thats why i will change my review to recomended if this get a patch or after a price drop/sale.

												I do not recommend the game to any AMD at the moment because AMD user will get a White screen of death while using Melee weapons. I've made a sticky with a temp fix for the issue and it has worked for a lot of people but not all.There is also the issue of resolution in full screen mode not working correctly and will make the game look worse than in window mode.Mouse and keyboard are not an option unless you like to torture yourself. Dark Souls levels of poor K+M controls. Gamepad is basically a must.Other than that it is your fancy hack'n'slash game starring a female android and a male android on quest to help mankind.Combat is just fine, jumping is a bit floaty and the graphics are dated. With the exception of the two main heroes of the game.Still the game demands a lot of power which is unreasonable because this game could be compared to Devil May Cry 4 which was released several YEARS ago and that game works a whole lot better. It also looks relatively close to this game.			"

Put in some horizontal bars, or re-render... whatever, I don't care, just don't make it look like I'm watching SDTV in 2006 on an early HDTV in ""Crush their heads"" mode. The second night, I discovered that the game didn't save my graphics settings, it ran on the wrong monitor, and it won't let me set my native resolution, either.

												Was so expecting towards this game and square enix again finds something to ♥♥♥♥ things up.First deus ex-Mankind divided and now this.Its 2017 you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ morons and when doing a port you have to support all god damn resolutions.What kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t are feeding us square enix.Gameplay and graphics are great and i have got nothing to complain.No resolution above 1080p supported.Yes . 2k and 4k are not supported.You are just playing at 1080 even when you set the resolution to 2k.Just use shadowplay to record and find out yourself.The recorded video has black bars and 1080p but says 2k.WTF .AND YOU HAVE THE AUDACITY TO COOLY STATE THAT THE GAME DOESNT OFFICIALLY SUPPORT 4k.GTFO			"

												Good game, bad port for now. Wait with the purchase until they fix the game.Some problems in the first 70 minutes:1. Fullscreen is bugged, will only display 1080p, regardless of what you set.2. ...but there is no borderless windowed option built-in3. and there is a 60fps limit (30 in cutscenes)4. 21:9 support is a hack, the picture is stretched5. You can't re-bind mouse buttons, or bind extra buttons6. We really need a dedicated dodge button for K+M controls too7. While music and Japanes VO is good, the game only supports 2.0 sound. No surround support.8. If you set to english subtitles + japanese VO, the subtitles lag behind. Plus the translation could have been more precise.9. Art direction is great. The engine and the graphics itself is not so. Performance is not the greatest I've met. MGS V has better performance and much better graphical fidelity.10. Memory consumption seems greatly underestimated. Recommended is 8GB, but last time I took a look at thhe memory consumption, the game was at 10GB11. Only partial steam controller supportGood stuff:- gameplay- story- Japanese VO- art direction- replayability- steam achievements & cards for those who want them. (note: for some achievements are bugged.)			"

												Time to rub my fingers together and screech like an autistic child.- - The game looked incredibly promising. And it was interesting and still is. But you telling me you can't keep up more than 10 Frames Per Second on a computer which was produced to run games on it and came out late 2016? No. I do not know whether thsi is an optimisation issue or its just plain bad, the game doesnt work. Sure, it looks pretty, but when you get into the fighting and your character responds a second after you have issued the command... That is bad. So don't play it... Yet. Wait for a patch or something. The Specs are the following: 12 GB ram Nvidia GTX 960 And an i7 I mean come on, jeez, I thought proting would be better nowadays. How do I refund a game again?			"

												Nier is an action RPG telling the story of 2B the android as she fight other robots on Earth along her android buddies. 2B and her side kick might not be the brightest of the bunch, but 2B specifically has one thing which makes her much more powerful than anyone else: a really fancy skirt. She's so protective of it she's even configured it to self-destruct to ensure no one else gets their hands on it.The combat is reminiscent of the gameplay in character action games (Bayonetta, Devil May Cry, etc), but the moveset is smaller, there's a much bigger focus on ranged combat, and you've got a dodge mechanic with an extremely forgiving amount of invincibity frames with no cooldown. The result is unique, fun combat with the downside that it's very easy cheese your way through fights. You can up the difficulty, but the only major difference I could find was that the game drastically increases how much damage the player takes when getting hit, which I don't feel is a fun way to make it challenging.The game will occasionally mix up the gameplay by throwing in some light platforming, different camera angles (which is often more frustrating than novel), and dual-stick shooter sequences. If you experiment with the controls, you'll find some additional moves to mix things up, but I found the combat isn't good enough to stay entertaining for the full duration of the game (if you're a completionist, reaching the first ending can easily take more than 20 hours).The world is fun to explore and there's some neat easter eggs/secrets hidden around, but some of the environments are bland to look at (post-apocalyptic cityscapes aren't very exciting to begin with, but it doesn't help that we've seen this type of landscape in so many other games already). The quest design is one of the weakest parts of the game. Side quests typically ask you to return to area X to kill enemies you've already fought in order to gain item Y. There's even several main story quests with the same design.Where the game really fell apart for me is how tedious it is to get to the final ending. You'll find yourself essentially repeating the entire game with minimal changes. The game tries to mix up the gameplay along the way, but I feel the changes only ended up making the combat worse, and there's no option to choose what type of combat you'd prefer. People who are more invested in the story might have the patience to play through the blatant repetition of content, but I found the structure to add a lot unnecessary tedium.Once you've completed the entire game, you unlock a chapter select feature which presents the story in a different, but far more sensible way. I'm confused as to why it wasn't designed that way to begin with as it would have drastically improved the flow of the game.I wish there was some kind of side-ways thumbs ""up"" option for Steam reviews as the exploration, combat, music, and a lot of the visual design manage to carry the game quite far despite its flaws. I can imagine some people will be able to look past the flaws if they really like the writing and story telling, or they might be satisfied with the first ending and be okay with stopping there, but overall I was left feeling disappointed by the game.

												I normally don't review games I play, but I felt the need to review NieR: Automata as I purchased this game based on all the great reviews it got and after playing through the first run, I totally disagree. Here are my thoughts; The game isn't bad but it's no where near the great reviews it's getting. Here's why I don't think the game is that great.1- Invisible walls: Some buildings look like they have an open door that look like 100% traversable, but you can't go through them. Same thing in different places. 2- Little to no interaction: There isn't much to interact with in this world, just fight, save and read your email?3- The ""complete"" campaign forces you to play through and through the game with different characters, with the first play through, I couldn't believe that this was the ""end"" of the game. 4- Not to spoil the game, but the last boss fight is frustrating to say the least, not fun, just frustrating. 5- Graphics: not that great. 6- Story: Can't really say as I have not completed the other character campaigns, but overall, it's ok but again not as great as what's in the reviews. I enjoyed the fighting mechanics in the game, but that's about it and yes, it does get repetative.			"

												If you want to play a game that says loudly 'We don't care about PC gamers, just did this for the money', go ahead buy this game.1080p resolution in reality is 900p in full screen. It's fine windowed, but guess what? NO BORDERLESS WINDOW BECAUSE WE DO NOT CARE.Controls are horrible. You have to dodge (obviously since it's an action game) a lot, but you have to doubletap. I guess THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH BUTTONS ON A KEYBOARD TO HAVE A DEDICATED DODGE BUTTON.Firing controls are stupid. You have to pull the mouse continously in the direction you want to fire. HAHAHA, YOU THOUGHT YOU CAN FIRE IN A DIRECTION? LET ME F*CK EVEN SOMETHING THIS SIMPLE UP BECAUSE WE JUST WANT YOUR MONEY.Don't buy this or anything else from these devs.			"

Didn't get the white screen/unable to fullscreen bug too, so I really have no idea what's wrong...I should just get a PS4. tl;dr - don't buy if your gpu isn't strong enough.

												Just had my refund given. Game might be fun if the devs would have taken the time to make a proper PC port. game ran okay but its basically only playble if you're using an xbox or ps4 controller. I wanted to use my steam controller but touch pads are a poor replacement for an anlog stick. The touchpads + motion controls are however great for mouse function.. however the devs of this game basically forgot that PC players use a thing called the mouse pretty frequently and often prefer it and thus basically did dic all to make the game work properly with the mouse. Even the default keys for the keyboard are ALL OVER the damn place.       bottom line, this feels like  PC port cash grab unless they can make this fun play on PC with out plugging in a controller. Is a damn shame becuase it looked like it would have been a fun game too. too bad the devs didnt didnt care about the audience they ported the game to.			"

												There are some issues with the port, luckily I havent had any of the white screen crashes. There is an issue with full screen 1080p actually being upscaled from a lower resolution which I was only able to fix by using a program to make the game window borderless fullscreen.The gameplay itself is great and clearly an upgrade if you played the original nier. Automata is something that  Nier fans will appreciate since the music studio is the same. The game feels so similar in terms of the vibe and direction of Nier so far (Only completed the first playthrough). If you luckily do not have issues with the game at the moment of launch day, then you are in for a great game.			"

												Q: Should I play Nier Automata?A: the real question is: have you already played all the games in your list? If yes than you should play NierA friend, once told not to play the new Zelda  as i would never play other games,  here is the same.The last 2 years gave us  games like The Phantom Pain,The Witcher 3,  Rise of the Tomb Rider,  Xenoblade Chronicles, The Talos  Principle,  Zelda, and few others.What i consider the final chapter of this list is Nier, and than there will be the void, unless some surprise show up, read Cyberpunk 2077.I startet gaming on the Vic 20 and commodore 64, writing my own games,  i got mad for Mario and Mike Tyson Punch Out on the NES and California Games on Atari Lynx, and i'm still a gamer, this is my passion and my job, I remember few games of the many i played, but this one i'll remember.Nier has a deep twisted story.Dynamic global illumination never seen before,Combat system that is close to perfectionSome of the best ""sub stories""  ever written for a game,The game does something that only FEZ did  at a similar level.and aside from the game there is the soundtrack, that alone, is a reason to buy the game.Yes  I will remember this game you bet i will.

												I feel sorry for the people having issues but it plays like a dream for me. i7 and 980 TI, have the game at max settings. No complaints. Visually and instrumentally a masterpiece. Combat is smooth. Depending on where you are in the level or enemies you are fighting, the game changes from 3rd person behind the shoulder to over the top or a side scrolling game. Which sounds stupid but it is done so flawlessly. I never knew I wanted it.  It's like blending old school arcade games with the action genre that the guys at Platinum about invented. (Looking at you Kamiya.) I guess if you don't have a strong PC you might want to stay away until they fix some of the issues. But if you are confinite in your machine, then I definitely recommend it.			"

												3/20/17- Turn off Ambient Occlusion! (if you're having fairly extreme pop in issues). Hopefully that advice is short lived, and things are running properly soon.I've only played about 9 hours so this could be considered more of an initial impression:I've been looking forward to NieR: Automata since I saw a trailer for it back in 2015... or more accurately, heard the trailer. I liked the dramatic music it was set to, which reminded me of Ghost in the Shell (and I guess Macross Plus a bit too). Turns out the game also reminds me a bit of Ghost in the Shell... and Macross Plus too, at times. With that said, I'd say the game itself is a big mix of familiar mechanics and story or character tropes... but it's how well it's all mixed together that keeps this game exciting. Even the game's settings get a unique spin to them. The combat also provides hack and slash simplicity and fluidity with a fairly deep customization system. The pods add a decent bit of bad assery as well. There are ""specials"" sort of like a quick time event... but without the usual excessive slowing of time that makes those more cinematic events less special. So I can appreciate that. I'm playing at normal difficulty so I'm not sure if it'd be different while playing it ""easy"". I might just not be too skilled but the ""normal"" difficulty is still pretty tricky, since dying is part of the gameplay, as you learn early on.It is my opinion that the story of this game comes before gameplay and aesthetic polish, but I could see someone arguing that they view the gameplay as the main draw. The art design is really great and so far has been pretty well suited, but the finish is pretty ""meh"" (invisible walls everywhere)... although sometimes it's due to the shift in style/perspective.So far, the story is cool, well paced, and I find it engaging. If you're into anime, or sci fi, or dystopian / post apocalyptic worlds, or sexy androids, etc, this game is worth picking up. Also if you're into the genre... or perhaps one of the genres this game blends in (adventure, hack and slash, RPG/JRPG, twin stick shooter, side scrolling shooter). The voice acting is good, and you can play with English or Japanese dialogue, which I always appreciate since I think the Japanese VA provides more melodrama. Just know that there will be times when dialogue pops up, mid battle, that you might miss tidbits of, due to not being able to read the subs without dying.			"

												Последний раз я покупаю у подобных долбаебов кривые порты. Вместо того,чтобы фиксить игру, они делают  8-Bit Bayonetta!!!!! Так держать, только всех ПОХУЙ на вашу байонетту, после такого ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥а с NierПройти пролог на харде - как будто пройти целую игру! Охлаждение пукана +1000, как только сделал первый сейв.Многие отзывы конечно преувеличены, да, игра особенная, необычный сетинг, сюжет, отличная боевка, НО  косяков целый вагон (тем более для PC версии ) и они далеко не мелкие: - местами откровенно ужасная графика (спасибо сонсолям), хотя даже для PS4 графоний слабый.  Такое ощущение, что весь ресурс ушел на 2b, да и то,  не такая уж там суперполигонная модель, чтобы сжирать все ресурсы.  Стоит посмотреть на НПС или некоторые объекты, вроде металлических бочек/остатков автомобилей/стены домов и из глаз течет кровь. Если запустить эмулятор PS2 и включить FF XII, там НПС будут выглядеть лучше, чем в Nier. Я далеко не графо♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, до сих пор легко и с удовольствием играю в старые добрые финалки, готику и т.п. Но настолько ужасные полигоны делать нельзя, тем более это не бэкграунт, а вот они, перед носом, ты пробегаешь мимо, забираешься на них и т.д.- откровенно дурацкая градация сложности. Есть легкий режим проходящийся на автомате благодаря чипам, ок.  Есть нормальный режим, с ним понятно. Есть сложный режим, что же в нем отличается? Да только то, что урон по персонажу увеличивается в разы, при этом сами враги остаются такими же ватными. Т.е. играя на сложном, кроме входящего в тебя урона, сложности ты не замечаешь. Рядовые враги все так же кладутся за 2-3 секунды, драться с ними просто скучно и неинтересно. Дополнительную легкость игре придает то, что с тобой бегает еще один андройд... Итого игра автоматически в 2 раза легче, что печалит. При этом пролог такие надежды подавал на игру, т.к. там ты был один. Но после него вас уже 2-е и игра становится в 2 раза легче. + можно поднимать погибших игроков которые будут драться за твою сторону + куча бафающих, пусть и на короткое время, итемов + сильно повышающийся с каждым грейдом оружия урон. Короче, явно перебор, казуальщиной прет за версту. Единственное, что от вас требуется, это вовремя нажимать уворот, которым можно спастись ОТ ЛЮБОГО снаряда/удара/каста и т.п. (привет DS и его перекаты)- невидимые стены... это вообще фейспалм. Бегаете вы по развалинам города, вокруг серые низкопалегонные коробки домов. В некоторые из них можно залезть, но как правило это видно по большим дыркам в этажах. В остальные же БОЛЬШИЕ проходы/арки/дырки/ пройти тупо нельзя! втф? Перед вами дверной проем в который одновременно могут войти как минимум 3 андройда, НО ВЫ НЕ МОЖЕТЕ В НЕГО ВОЙТИ, там просто невидимая стена. И это бред, для 2017 года это полнейший бред. Такие места нужно закалачивать/перекрывать/завал какой то делать (ну завалы есть иногда).  -открытый мир на самом деле представляет собой кишку, просто чуть шире, чем в обычных играх, и толку от лишнего пространства никакого, т.к. в основном это тупо полянки с травой/земля и т.п.  Да, в некоторые места вы можете пойти сразу, без бумаг/пропусков и прочего, но враги там банально на 20-30 лвл выше, следовательно делать вам там просто нечего.- во время обычных диалогов ни персонажи, ни нпс не шевелят губами, да что там, у них вообще никакой мимики нет на лице! При этом иногда идет озвучка... Такое себе- некоторые текстуры прогружаются прямо перед тобой! Это ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ товарищи. Возможно это такая оптимизация, или это сделано специально для консолей, чтобы они хотя бы могли 50-60 фпс вытянуть, не знаю. Но когда в играх с подобной графикой происходит такое, это очень печалит. При чем это не знависит от конфигурации вашего пс, у людей с gtx 1080 те же просадки фпс и прочие глюки.			"

												I'm happy with this game so far.Pros:+ No major technical issues (it supports 21:9 resolutions and I'm getting actually good performance with GTX 1080 @ 3440x1440).+ The game itself is very unique (I got the feeling that abandoned Earth feels more ""alien"" than supposedly alien planets in Mass Effect: Andromeda) and the plot is enjoyable.+ It has a really great soundtrack. Sometimes I just sit there and listen to music instead of continuing to play further.Cons:- Minor technical issues (1. You need to use ""Borderless Gaming"" application to run the game in borderless fullscreen mode; 2. Normal fullscreen mode isn't working properly with screen resolutions above 1920x1080 at this moment; 3. Ambient Occlusion may cause texture/mesh pop-ins in some areas).- Since it's a console port, there's a good chance that you'll find this game less enjoyable if you use a keyboard.This review is a subject to change. However, I don't think that my impressions will change drastically.P.S. Why didn't I say anything about the gameplay? Well, because I don't want to spoil things, and because it's a story-driven game. If you expect a braindead diablo-like slasher where you can mute the game and talk to your friends on some voice-chat while playing, you will be disappointed. Don't get me wrong: gameplay is fun and engaging, but (most of the time) you don't kill things to kill even more things in NieR. You do it to continue the story.			"

I've have never played the previous Nier game or anything related to it so the story while kind of vague so far has my interest peaked to where I want to know what's going on. The robot voice acting is the only thing I find slightly irritatting but that is minor. The game switches things up camera and play style wise to keep things semi fresh. A boss fight can go from typical beat em up to side scroller to twin stick shooter to top down shooter on the fly and it adds a level of excitement to the game. Definitely recommend giving a look.

												Последний раз я покупаю у подобных долбаебов кривые порты. Вместо того,чтобы фиксить игру, они делают  8-Bit Bayonetta!!!!! Так держать, только всех ПОХУЙ на вашу байонетту, после такого ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥а с NierПройти пролог на харде - как будто пройти целую игру! Охлаждение пукана +1000, как только сделал первый сейв.Многие отзывы конечно преувеличены, да, игра особенная, необычный сетинг, сюжет, отличная боевка, НО  косяков целый вагон (тем более для PC версии ) и они далеко не мелкие: - местами откровенно ужасная графика (спасибо сонсолям), хотя даже для PS4 графоний слабый.  Такое ощущение, что весь ресурс ушел на 2b, да и то,  не такая уж там суперполигонная модель, чтобы сжирать все ресурсы.  Стоит посмотреть на НПС или некоторые объекты, вроде металлических бочек/остатков автомобилей/стены домов и из глаз течет кровь. Если запустить эмулятор PS2 и включить FF XII, там НПС будут выглядеть лучше, чем в Nier. Я далеко не графо♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, до сих пор легко и с удовольствием играю в старые добрые финалки, готику и т.п. Но настолько ужасные полигоны делать нельзя, тем более это не бэкграунт, а вот они, перед носом, ты пробегаешь мимо, забираешься на них и т.д.- откровенно дурацкая градация сложности. Есть легкий режим проходящийся на автомате благодаря чипам, ок.  Есть нормальный режим, с ним понятно. Есть сложный режим, что же в нем отличается? Да только то, что урон по персонажу увеличивается в разы, при этом сами враги остаются такими же ватными. Т.е. играя на сложном, кроме входящего в тебя урона, сложности ты не замечаешь. Рядовые враги все так же кладутся за 2-3 секунды, драться с ними просто скучно и неинтересно. Дополнительную легкость игре придает то, что с тобой бегает еще один андройд... Итого игра автоматически в 2 раза легче, что печалит. При этом пролог такие надежды подавал на игру, т.к. там ты был один. Но после него вас уже 2-е и игра становится в 2 раза легче. + можно поднимать погибших игроков которые будут драться за твою сторону + куча бафающих, пусть и на короткое время, итемов + сильно повышающийся с каждым грейдом оружия урон. Короче, явно перебор, казуальщиной прет за версту. Единственное, что от вас требуется, это вовремя нажимать уворот, которым можно спастись ОТ ЛЮБОГО снаряда/удара/каста и т.п. (привет DS и его перекаты)- невидимые стены... это вообще фейспалм. Бегаете вы по развалинам города, вокруг серые низкопалегонные коробки домов. В некоторые из них можно залезть, но как правило это видно по большим дыркам в этажах. В остальные же БОЛЬШИЕ проходы/арки/дырки/ пройти тупо нельзя! втф? Перед вами дверной проем в который одновременно могут войти как минимум 3 андройда, НО ВЫ НЕ МОЖЕТЕ В НЕГО ВОЙТИ, там просто невидимая стена. И это бред, для 2017 года это полнейший бред. Такие места нужно закалачивать/перекрывать/завал какой то делать (ну завалы есть иногда).  -открытый мир на самом деле представляет собой кишку, просто чуть шире, чем в обычных играх, и толку от лишнего пространства никакого, т.к. в основном это тупо полянки с травой/земля и т.п.  Да, в некоторые места вы можете пойти сразу, без бумаг/пропусков и прочего, но враги там банально на 20-30 лвл выше, следовательно делать вам там просто нечего.- во время обычных диалогов ни персонажи, ни нпс не шевелят губами, да что там, у них вообще никакой мимики нет на лице! При этом иногда идет озвучка... Такое себе- некоторые текстуры прогружаются прямо перед тобой! Это ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ товарищи. Возможно это такая оптимизация, или это сделано специально для консолей, чтобы они хотя бы могли 50-60 фпс вытянуть, не знаю. Но когда в играх с подобной графикой происходит такое, это очень печалит. При чем это не знависит от конфигурации вашего пс, у людей с gtx 1080 те же просадки фпс и прочие глюки.			"

												I have only played about 2 and a half hours of this game.  I might be biased because I am a huge fan of how it looks, how it plays and how good looking 2B is.I started this game up with the expection that it would run terrible and that I would end up refunding it.  I was wrong.  Most of the people on here are people with outdated computers, complaining about how ""bad"" the game is.  I will give you one thing, for a game with an AAA price, it should be better at launch - but all of that aside, the game is absoulutely beautiful, it plays phenomenally, and the soundtrack is a masterpiece.The game does have its issues, sometimes I can't click on menus and have to use enter, etc.  Sometimes when I launch chrome or discord it makes my character move all by itself.  This might be due to it thinking im doing something on my second monitor, but who knows.  I am running this game on a MSI GTX 1080 FTW 8GB, Intel i7-6700k, 16gb ddr3 ram, and an SSD for loading times and the only problem I have had was with the 1 frame fps drops when going into a new area which is understandable.  My settings are all maxed and still run a solid 60.I saw people complaining about how they're bothered by the fact that the cutscenes are in 30fps.  Some games such as 'For Honor' had the same ""laggy"" cutscenes, and I havent seen people talking about that.  If SE/Platinum fixes the fullscreen glitches and the anti-aliasing problems, we should be just fine.   WARNING BEFORE BUYING:   - The game is pseudo open world, meaning that its open world but you can't go into every building on the map, etc.  - The map is HUGE, been playing for 3 hours and only have seen 1/30th of map.    - Auto Save is not a feature in this game, you have to find places to save in game.    - There are 26 endings in this game, DO NOT stop playing after the first credit screen.Overall, this is an amazing game and I can recommend this to anybody, it isnt worth the amount they are charging and if you want you can wait for the sale in a couple weeks/months.

												I like the combat a lot but I'm a big fan of most Platinum games. I've have never played the previous Nier game or anything related to it so the story while kind of vague so far has my interest peaked to where I want to know what's going on. The robot voice acting is the only thing I find slightly irritatting but that is minor. The game switches things up camera and play style wise to keep things semi fresh. A boss fight can go from typical beat em up to side scroller to twin stick shooter to top down shooter on the fly and it adds a level of excitement to the game. Definitely recommend giving a look.

												This is the most infuriating game I've ever played and none of those reasons are for the gameplay.First every single one of the cutscenes in the game is 1600 x 904, compressed in MPEG1 at FORTY megabits. Thats an abomination right there. If you've ever had stuttering in this game, thats why, your computer was trying to load this huge bloated uncompressed MPEG1 files, a video standard introduced in 1993 thats just as outdated as WINDOWS 3.1.Then the game has NO SAVE POINTS for the first part of the game at all, now that wouldn't be too bad but the first part of the game varies WIDLY in performance. So if say the game crashes, tabs wrong(it always tabs wrong, do not alt tab this game), you forgot to read the ""This game doesn't have autosaves"" disclaimer and shut it off, or you don't feel like playing for over an hour after you've already spent FOUR HOURS fighting with the games ancient MPEG1 FILES and horrible performance issues, or you die. Thats it, WELCOME TO THE VERY BEGGINING OF THE GAME.Now I wouldn't have too much trouble with the Save issue if the game just worked, IT DOES NOT, this is an abomination of a PC port the likes of which I've seldom seen, these cutscenes are huge, just doing some fairly basic compression on them brings down their size by half and solved all my cutscene stuttering problems with the game. But the game wasn't done yet and I had to deal with other issues involving performance and fiddling with settings INSIDE OF A FIGHT, and because there ARE NO SAVE POINTS FOR THIS PART OF THE GAME, I can't just throw the fight and get my settings right first time, no I have to go through the ENTIRE INTRODUCTION AGAIN if I ever exit out of it for ANY REASON WHATSOEVER.Then there is the huge amount of fiddling and tedium I had to go with this game in order to get it to run properly, first the cutscenes. They suck, they're horribly HORRIBLY uncompressed and actually cause performance issues and even doing a quick hack job fix with re-encoding them in a basic and fast way cut their size down by over half. Then the game constantly ran into performance issues while running and I had to get somebody else's performance fix to un-break the game's broken lighting system which was about half of the game's performance problems right then and there. Keep in mind every time I test one of these things I have to do the same introduction shooter segment again in order to get to a point in the game where performance is actually an issue, EVERY SINGLE TIME, because the game doesn't save and doesn't allow you to save.So what game time you see that I have is the same things again and again and again, the first time it was fun, the third time it was tiring, the fifth time it crashed and I had to do that shooter segment again was too much. This game has infuriated me more than any other game I've ever known, and I've played CS:GO with Vsync on against other players.TL:DR: The game is a poor PC port that more or less requires you to re-encode all the cutscenes in the game yourself, implement 3rd party fixes for the needlessly intensive lighting system, doesn't let you save while you're doing this so you have to play the same scene over and over to finally find out of you've fixed all its problems, then it won't let you save for the next hour or so. I hate this game so much for all that.			"

TL;DR
Not recommended until the main issues are fixed.Main issues : fullscreen bug, performance issues, shader issues, clipping.This is sold at full AAA price and should be held up to AAA standards. For now this is barely a 30$ port.Too many issues to even call this a lazy port.I wonder how blocking pirates for 2 weeks is going to help sales if this kind of broken product is released. Devs would have been better off spending these 10 days working on the port instead of implementing Denuvo.PC Port IssuesFullscreen bugAs of now (17th march), the game cannot be played in fullscreen as it doesn't show up in the chosen resolution. It even pixellises the steam overlay. You can either play in windowed mode or use a 3rd party program to go pseudo-fullscreen (borderless windowed).Testing setupPretty strong pc ; i7-6700k, 16GB DDR4 RAM, GTX 1080Windowed mode, 1440p, no v-sync, AA x8, texture filtering x16, everything else the highest possiblePlaying with wired Xbox 360 controllerPerformance reportGame is locked at 60 fps.No performance issues during gameplay, but I have a strong PC so you might want to check other reviews.Horrendous stuttering in cutscenes. (~10-15 fps)Pros+ Not locked at 30 fps+ Runs at 60 fps most of the time+ No screen tearing without v-sync nor g-sync (no g-sync because no fullscreen)+ Controls can be rebound (even for your controller! nice surprise)Meh* Not possible to go over 60 fps (I have a 144 hz monitor :/ )* Can select up to 4k but bigger resolutions are not fully supportedCons- Fullscreen displays in wrong resolution bug- Performance issues, lower resolution and strong aliasing in cutscenes- Weird aliasing on most meshes even with AA x8- Shader issues causing heavy aliasing on models (chunks of pixels ""taken off"" the mesh + blur ; ie the giant boss with crane arms that was in the demo), mainly the sky shaders- Clearly noticeable clipping in open world- Shadow resolution is subpar- UI/menu/texts have a fixed resolution so they appear blurry in resolutions over 1080pThe game itselfPros+ Impressive character design and modelling work on main characters+ High quality gameplay animations (meh for cutscenes)+ Gameplay is fun and varied+ RPG elements are interesting and pretty open (you are not forced into 1 fighting style and can change pretty much anytime)+ Music is top qualityMeh* Not a fan of the character design of most enemies* Not a fan of the english voice actors so far and it feels like there is something wrong with the voice recording qualityCons- PC port- Denuvo (might cause performance issues and leave files behind even after uninstalling the game)- Pretty terrible environment models and textures (~ mid PS3). I didn't expect the devs to fix this for the pc port but damn I have seen better looking indie games with similar map sizes.			"

												Well where to begin. I initially gave this a poor rating because it runs poorly, but now that I've played through the entire first storyline I'll actually review it. Pros:-Fluid combat-Complicated backstory-ButtsCons:-Some textures are honestly awful.-60 fps cap-Plagued with technical issues that I haven't experienced but many others have-The game runs like crap for how bad it looks. I get higher average frame rates in Rise of the Tomb Raider and that game is much more visually impressive.-Lack of combat depth. Its very fluid but you're limited to 4 weapons and no real combos. Nothing intricate-Basically zero enemy variety. They're all a mod of the regular robot, you get big ones, bigger ones, really big ones, flying ones, and weird dinosaur shaped ones, and thats basically it. Sometimes you get shooty ones.-For a game that relies so much on story it's annoying you have to play through the game again to see it from 9S's perspective.-The world is really pretty small and feels pretty dry-There are no interesting characters outside of the ones interacted with in the main story-The twist isn't surprising at all-Basically everything besides the main story feels like tacked on garbage, I mean its Ubisoft go here do this/escort/random meaningless crap in the open world but instead of interacting with likeable characters you are interacting with machines who have voices that will drive you insane.Uncertain:-The music is ♥♥♥♥ing weird. Its good in that it fits the game but bad as in its a pain to listen to. Honestly this game feels like it should have been a movie or a book. Being a game actively detracts from the narrative and makes the story less enjoyable overall. If you are into this game just for the story I would definitely recommend it. Skip most of the side missions as they are a waste of time.If you want a game with meaningful gameplay elements I would say to pass on this one. Original Review: (Still true)Runs and looks like garbage, another ♥♥♥♥ pc port.Can't hold 60fps on a gtx 1070 in 1440p			"

												Too many graphical issues at the moment to recommend.There is a fullscreen bug that numerous other reviews have mentioned that I find hard on the eyes. Imagine cinematic widescreen masking, except it's a whole black border around the game window.Even when using a controller, the mouse cursor remains on the middle of the screen. Cursor only goes away when using m+kb.Game switched from Fullscreen mode to Windowed during a cutscene, preventing me from changing the settings because I was in a cutscene.An app from GitHub shouldn't be required to play Borderless Windowed or to make the game Alt-Tab friendly.As a side note, I have a GTX980, so I haven't run into the issue AMD GPU users have been having, but that issue shouldn't be happening.I honestly don't know what I was expecting from a port. Maybe I had too much hope since it's a Platinum game. I'll hold on to the game for a bit and continue to hope some of these issues are fixed, but my hopes aren't high that the fix turnaround times will be that fast.			"

												First thing is first. I've played Nier: Automata for just over 4 hours. This is not a review of the full game experience, it is a ""so-far"" review. I don't usually write reviews, and I have certainly never written a review before finishing a game before. But then, I've never played a game as frustrating as this one.And that's not because of the gameplay, which so far is pretty solid DMC-meets RPG lite-open world fare. The machine enemies are really great. They have more character than pretty much any protagonist in any game I've played in recent years. So far, 2B fares much less well. Mostly tells people to shut up. She shuts down any interesting conversation before it gets going. Because of that, 9S is more endearing to me so far as he likes to ask real questions about what he knows of the world and why he is there. As the game is I can't wait to play more of it to find out what the machines will be doing next to make me question the nature of humanity, communication and emotions. Unfortunately that brings me onto the real reason I am writing this review.System specs out of the way first:i7 6700k (stock clocks)GTX 970 Gigabyte G1 Gaming16GB 3000mhz RAMWindows 10Installed on a 7200RPM 1TB hard drive (NOT SSD)GPU driver 378.92 installedNow the first thing is the well known ""Fullscreen bug"". This bug essentially causes the game to render inaccurately on your monitor causing a black border all around the screen along with squashed text. The output is reported as 1080i. This greatly reduces the fidelity of the game and makes it much more difficult to play. You may have seen a fix called ""Borderless Gaming"" which is a seperate app that forces the game to run in a full borderless window and sidesteps this issue. This works fine. However I find it unacceptable. The only other game I have had to use a seperate app to get it to render appropriately was Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition. No gamer should have to download a 3rd party app just to access a game they've purchased.The second problem I have with this game is stuttering. Now I don't know if this is because I am using a dinosaur Hard drive, but while traversing the world it hitches pretty regularly. Combat isn't really affected but it dampens the experience somewhat. The animations are pretty good and very fluid. This just breaks that.The third, and the most grievous problem I've had is the screen freezing issue. In this game it randomly freezes the image on the screen while the game continues to play out in the background. You can hear characters moving around and hear the menus etc, but so far I have been unable to remedy this problem without restarting the game. Now sometimes games freeze. I can accept that as a PC gamer. The real problem here is how the save system works. You are unable to save until completing the tutorial/opening area (this took me 50 minutes) and even after that you can only save at old fashioned save points. There are no automatic checkpoints. This means saves every time you see an oppurtunity in case the game crashes and progress is lost. This is the killer for me that has convinced me to wait to play the game until it's fixed. Although save points are plentiful in some areas, there is a complete lack of them in others.A final word performance wise. Settings at 1080p, high except shadows which are medium. AO off, AA off. I get a solid 60fps (except those stutters I mentioned) and it's mostly fine. It doesn't look great. It looks a bit like a jazzed up last gen game unfortunately, but it is enough to convey the world appropriately so I'm not going to complain too much.Hopefully when some of the issues with this port are fixed I can revise this review and give it a recommended, which I would happily do if it just worked.TL:DR: This game has great promise from what I have played. The port is rubbish. Wait until fixed.			"

												The game in itself is pretty decent and sometimes pretty great too, but I just can't bring myself to like this game with the poor optimization, bland enemies and repetitive button smash gameplay. The only thing this full priced game really has going for it is the soundtrack, it's absolutely amazing. Though I would rather just buy the soundtrack and leave the game be. The story is also interesting most of the time, but sometimes I just don't care about the characters.			"

												Very poor performance ie. low frame rate.  A third-party mod improves this but cutscenes can still plummet to 30FPS.  Oddly, they appear to be downscaling the resolution when this occurs as well (pixellation visible).  No borderless window mode.Buggy.  Running in dedicated fullscreen results in the image being stretched lengthways.  Changing graphics settings such as ambient occlusion causes the game to slow down to 10FPS, or causes the screen to go blank.  Occasionally, you can change a setting without the game breaking.Odd, unintuitive, unresponsive controls.  In the shooter sequences the heavy attack frequently failed to activate or cut right through an enemy while dealing no damage.  In the turret-mode sequences one cannot aim with the mouse; you have to use the WASD keys.  I gave up and just spammed heavy attack.  Dodge cannot be rebound; it's double-tap WASD or nothing - and that's too slow to be useful.In short, unplayable.  Pop it on your wish list and give it 6 months for fixes (or further mods) to be released and hopefully turn it into a functional product.Specs:i7 3930K @ 4.2GHz16RAMGeforce GTX 970 4GMWindows 10 Pro			"

												This game is great but not for my rig i guess..... -_-GTX1060 6GB Windforcei5 7500 (3.4 - 3.7)8GB DDR4 2400mhzWin10 64bitI tried 1920 x 1080 and could only get a window mode which i can deal with till a fix happens but i also had bad frame dips with it just running rough and unconsistent. Basically The game demo ran much better on my base PS4 over this 1080p rig i built.  1080p, high settings @ 60fps should not be asking that much from a game like this,! Esppecially if a 299$ ps4 can run it better then my 850$ buld. At least for me i cant keep it but if it all gets sorted out i will so buy this back in a heart beat!!! But for now i can not.  :(			"

I recommend this game.  It's a fun, hectic hack 'n' slash and just what I wanted out of the first 40 minutes.I do not recommend purchasing it if your PC does not readily exceed the ""recommended"" specs by a great amount, and even then you will likely have to step down your resolution a few steps from what you're used to/your native resolution.  The game has some kind of niggling issue with optimization that the specs in the store page do not account for.  This is not related to MSAA, either.Because of the fact that people will be misled into purchasing a game that they cannot run well or cannot run at all due to technical issues, I am forced to give this game a thumbs down.  I will revise this review on any sort of patch, but as of posting this is the fourth day with no infomation from the developers about technical fixes.  It kills me to do this, but I can't recommend this title in good faith in its current state.			"

												I love the third person fighting but loath the top down ""Twin stick"" style. Every time I get into the action and really enjoy this game I get thrown into 2-D style, which aint bad, then the twin stick style and I tear my hair out. All my deaths have come from the top down and its frustrated me to the point where I have to stop playing. Very annoying as I really like the game but its currently unplayable for me, and maybe for others. If you struggle with controlling the game in the flight section at the begining of the game, or at the begining of the second level/chapter, then I would say refund before the cut off, as it only gets more frustating later.If not, carry on and enjoy.

												The zest that filled the gamer in me seeking adventure soon came to the reality that was this particular game, in this particular platform. I'll be blunt: The game itself was not ready for a PC release in the first place. Like many concerns about the fluidity of the game from console to PC, Automata's lacking in optimization that is incorporated in a PC and does not really...function with the options at hand. And this is only for visual concerns. Convoluted, this review may seem. But if you want to invest on it now, I will not encourage you; that is your choice [as of this date].Concerns out of the way, the gameplay is...well. It's just so da** awesome. It's a mix of themes that, honestly, I thought I was playing with a buggy camera. Really, if it wasn't for the chops in frames, I would play it more. I'm honestly glad that I haven't played long before I regretted this puurchase. (Note: My PC is fairly decent with a GeForce GTX960. Performance may very for others.)			"

												Interesting idea yet lazy at the same time. I've never been a fan of ""New Game +"". I might replay an exceptional game again in a few years but never immediately afterwards. I understand that a second play through is probably quite different but I made it as far as the desert and it's got the same problems. I somewhat sped through it the first time around hoping it would pick up but it didn't. The environments are drab, characters enigmas, combat repetitive, story obtuse, music fantastic; overall a slight thumbs down from me but I probably haven't experienced the best of it. The core of it just isn't enjoyable enough to warrant repeating the slog.			"

												With an Intel Core (i7) and a GTX 860M (yes, I'm on a laptop), I can run most late-2016 games on high graphics or better with smooth framerate. This, on the other hand, this is a pretty bad port. Low graphics with 4-6 average FPS? That's a no-no. Unless anyone want to kill my eyes by having to look at a game at 300x200 resolution to get 30 FPS (half of the framerate cap), you probably shouldn't buy it until a more optimized patch comes out.

												Edit: After finishing the game, I must say this is one of my favorite games of all times, it does such special and unique things which I clearly do not want to spoil here. I think few games ever managed to make me feel like this one did. Honestly I can not think of a person who would not be better of making this experience in their life, even if in the end they might hate it (which I think most won't). A masterpiece.Ok so this is just a short review: First of all the game runs with 100% stable 60 fps at 1440p (GTX1070) for me and I had no resolution bugs or whatsoever in my entire playtime so far! The gameplay (mashup of twinstick, sidescroller and mostly(!) 3rd person action shooter/brawler mix ala Vanquish meets Bayonetta + partially open world RPG) is fun and engaging and the story and the way it is told really is something special!I am playing on hard difficulty, and besides the introduction section the game is fairly easy to play on hard, thx to an amazing doding mechanic, which unlike bayonetta does not require ultra precise timing to work. This is perfectly ok, as the game was designed around being one or twoshot, which requires you to be able to dodge a lot more reliable.I would highly recommend this game to gamers of ANY skill, as the easy mode literally allows (optionally) the game to play itself, even partially if wished for, great for gamers who only want to witness the world and story or have diabillities!(As a side Note: I actually really enjoyed the initial challenge and design of the introduction a lot and might have wished for more of that during the game as the RPG elements do tend to be fun but create an entirely different experience which is not as challenging and fast paced, but sometimes rather relaxing and meditative due to the great soundtrack and rather slow pacing in most parts of the open world. Also the abundance of healing items (you can literally carry up to 400 in your inventory at once, making oneshots the only threat) is maybe not othe best design decision for a higher difficulty setting, which is probably why very hard only consists of oneshots. As I do believe it is highly unrealsitic that everythign onshots you in this game, it does take away a lot of the immersion for me, and I like the partial oneshot approach of hard a lot more, but having less healing available would be nice.)I will update this review once I ""finished"" the game some more.SLIGHT SPOILER ALERT, read AFTER beating the game (you might miss out on a lot if you do not do what I ""spoil"" here): Press continue after the games ending, seriously do it.

Also the cutscenes are really choppy and stuttery and it's definitely the worst part about the port in my experience.

												The game in general was good. Combat , exploration, setting, story, are all really good. However the ending is bad in my opinion. SPOILER WARNING. So I was enjoying the game quite a bit, leveling steadily, starting to manage not dying at all and starting to kill bosses on my first try ( on Hard difficulty ), things started to feel very satisfying. Then the 'boat mission' starts, before going in you don't get any wornings that the map will be permanently affected ( side quests and all) before going in, which I guess is my own fault cause I am not used to not being notified. Then you go to a few random areas and do random stuff then you fight the final boss and end the game one after the other without any side objectives what so ever and lil time to actually buy stuff. So that's all like whatever, but my problem is that they don't developpe ANY story elements at all, what was with the rogue androids ? What are the humans doing ? what will happen to the machines after the end ? So many questions unanswered ( many because they were all in side quests ?). Any ways good game, ending upset me, and upset that the majority of the game is in new game plus.			"

												A combination of my 2 favorite Platinum Games titles, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance and Bayonetta. The game is primarily a hack and slash with very lite RPG elements. The reason I say ""primarily"" is because the game shifts between hack and slash to bullet hell shooter to platformer seemlessly. At the time of this review, there are a few technical issues but not entirely game breaking depending on your rig. This game seems to be hit or miss depending on your setup. I have a GTX1080ti, AMD FX-9590, and 16 GB RAM and I get constant 60. It also ran smooth with a GTX 1060 for me. I have heard people with less powerful rigs running it smoother than those with powerful rigs. If you can get it to run smmothly, it's a great game.			"

												The game runs and plays like ♥♥♥♥ and anyone saying otherwise is completely uninformed or not capable of using their ♥♥♥♥ing eyes to see the shortcomings of this port. The key mapping doesnt support any extra buttons that arent part of the base keys, so it wont let me map anything to my extra mouse buttons for example. The controls are unplayable in general without a controller, which shouldnt be the case. For example you lock on with q and shoot with L-shift, which means you have to use your index and pointer to do all of your movement while still holding the other 2 buttons down(??????). The res doesnt render at anything higher than 1080 and the framerate cap are are waaaay too many ♥♥♥♥ ups for this game to be enjoyable.I was hoping for something adequate considering squareenix published the tomb raiders which ran brilliantly on PC. Nier on PC is seriously complete ♥♥♥♥ing garbage. I honestly think the only reason this game has any good buzz is because most of it is from console players who don't know any better and only have other garbage games to compare it to.

												UST AS I EXPECTED ......This game is F****** bad ♥♥♥!!! I can not express how good it is . I turned it on and did an hour pull first go around, camera can be a little monkey but that is the worst of it . *** The style is awesome . Graphics are not the best but the style makes it better than anything this year. ***The switch between plat forming and 3rd open to 2D space shooter work shoo well , you almost want it to be its each own game . ****Awesome combat . Variety to the fullest . Enemies are unforgiving and awesome looking . Color full combat is not to be forgotten . It is a mix between devil may cry and dark souls and something better . ***** Jumping and exploring is great . lots of big buildings to get atop and soar around . **** Those RPG fans do not worry , great expansion on upgrades and tech to allow character customization to the fullest . maybe fuller than any other RPG five played .***Very cool weapons , with the option to upgrade as well.***Combat drone is bad ♥♥♥ and i really love how they incorporated it in to the game play.********* 21;9 support*****************Bosses are EPIC********  BEST IN CLASS HANDS DOWN****************GOOD LEARNING CURVE . THERE IS A STRATEGY TO GET DECENT************************ WEAPONS FEEL GREAT AND LOOK EVEN BETTER.***************GAME OF THE YEAR FOR ME . CANT WAIT TO GET FURTHER IN . camera can be a little WONKEY but that is the worst of it . THIS IS COMING FROM SOMEONE HOW HAS NO PREVIOUS KLUDGE ABOUT THIS GAME .			"

												A combination of my 2 favorite Platinum Games titles, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance and Bayonetta. The game is primarily a hack and slash with very lite RPG elements. The reason I say ""primarily"" is because the game shifts between hack and slash to bullet hell shooter to platformer seemlessly. At the time of this review, there are a few technical issues but not entirely game breaking depending on your rig. This game seems to be hit or miss depending on your setup. I have a GTX1080ti, AMD FX-9590, and 16 GB RAM and I get constant 60. It also ran smooth with a GTX 1060 for me. I have heard people with less powerful rigs running it smoother than those with powerful rigs. If you can get it to run smmothly, it's a great game.			"

												This game is a hit and miss for me on spectacular levels in either direction. Firstly I really like the elegant look of the characters(even besides erotic!), the soundtrack is good and memorable, the game looks pretty good, the mechanics are interesting, the atmosphere is very consistent and invokes a feeling of near constant dread. But most of all it is it's presentation and flawless transition between sidescrolling and third person(the camera work is really something in this game).On the other hand it's way too much anime-ish for my liking. The plot is okay and unforgiving(without further spoilers), the characters are painfully predictable and generic - which brings me back to point one: it's exactly like watching an anime - you just know what's going to happen in each dialogue that comes by because the character's motives are as flat as one characterizing trait that intermittently gets broken/softened. I don't really mind the concept of having a bombshell female character in the lead but the game's kinda pushing it too much in my face for my liking(other people praying it'd be as literal as formulated). The controls, at least for keyboard and mouse, are awkward. The combat is alot of fun, but very inaccurate for it's clearly a console port. The game is, besides the initial impression being very different, actually rather easy. The story counts more plotholes than I can keep track of, but is still legitimately surprising on more than several occasions(I wouldn't dare say it's as good as others do - but as far as it keeping you glued to the game it does a really good job). The main writer made a serious effort to overcomplicate it by messing with the order in which it plays out - which to me feels a bit pretentious considering the initial story(and it's ""explanation"") are very weak.Overall it's a very unique game, with excellent design and sounds, that's an awful lot of fun to play with a twisted pulp story that doesn't fail to surprise.

												This game is immediately everything I've ever wanted in a game. (2 hours played)EDIT: Now for a real review, after ~13 hours played.Music: ♥♥♥♥ing awesome.Designs: God damn.Environments: Beautiful.Story: Anime/10. I love the setting so much that the actual story is superfluous to me. Its got some nice themes, and a surprising amount of clever elements, but little actual depth from what I've seen. Might change as i experience more endings.Gameplay:I can easily see this becoming monotonous or grindy to a lot of people, but its interwoven into the story quite nicely, and the experience is actually just genuinely fun. A younger me wouldve probably ragequit a few times, but the variety of skills needed just to progress in this game (assuming youre playing on hard or above) keeps it interesting pretty constantly. I especially love the save system, but I can see why some might hate it. The plugin system is pretty refreshing too; the fact that UI isnt changed by settings, but by loadout and character progression, is really cool. Haven't had any performance issues, but I've only played it on powerful hardware. Have only really played it with an XBox controller, but the keyboard and mouse integration seems to be well done. However, the gameplay skills used in this game are virtually all designed around using a controller.Fullscreen is a bit wonky, but I suspect this varies highly depending on your hardware. 1080s have had displayport issues. Shiftwindow is definitely recommended software for this game, if you play above 1920*1080.			"

												I am a mouse and keyboard player, and for 60€ I do expect good controls. I don't expect them to be as good as a controller, but they should be at least plausible and follow some canvation. The thing is, they are almost there, there are just two main things that really bug me and I don't even think they are that hard to change.First of all the dodging done via double tapping a directional key. There is literally no good reason why you would do something like this. In a game that requires fast reaction, doing this is just sloppy and unresponsive. What really astounds me is that this was a conscious decision by someone, as it's harder to implement a double tap, then literally just a single button. Somebody thought this was a good idea, no it isn't, we have more than enough buttons, and this game doesn't require that many in the first place.Second, the third person camera, the camera perspective that you use most of the time. It's damn annoying that it is constantly trying to ""correct"" your perspective. If you run forward then it's trying to swing your camera in that direction, the same with any other direction, or if a enemy attacks. With the mouse this ""feature"" is not needed, I can be my own camera man just fine (and I am not talking about the different camera perspective shifts, they are fine and fun). It is just annoying that I constantly need to countermotion the camera to keep a overview over a bettle, this just don't makes things better, but the opposite, much worse. The thing I am asking here are just some IF statements, so we can just disable it.That's it, this two things would make the controls hugely better and almost as good as a controller. I be honest, I don't think this is much to ask, as I don't think it is that hard to implement. A competent programmer should be able to do it fairly quickly. Harder to fix is the hacking minigame, but I never found them that hard, so I am fine with them.As it stands it's a great game, with grand philosophical questions (less escort missions would been nice thought), and I am happy to see that this games start to come out on pc. But with this problems I just can't recommend it.			"

												This steam review consists of mostly port related issues and certain design choices which pretty much made me not want to continue playing, at all.Well, first of all, the controls. The game jumps in and out of many different control schemes. 2D, 3D, space shooter... side scroller... it goes in and out of everything, yet most of them control terribly with KB/M. Basically every time you have to manually move the camera or manually target your bullets along with moving, the mouse control hinders you.""It's not the kind of game that works well with kb/m"" you might think. That's objectively false. Almost every single aspect of it could have worked fine if they had made it properly, as it's mechanics taken right out of other games, and they work fine with kb/m. They simply gave it the middle finger.While on the subject of kb/m, there is no dedicated kb/m dodge button, making the combat way harder than it should be. Even the double tap they have is not responsive.Next on the list, performance. It stutters on my system (specs at the bottom), a lot. Not even for a second the game felt as if it was running smoothly during the hack'n'slash sections. Weirdly enough, during the shooter sections it works fine, but during the grounded sections it feels like a chore.Gameplay wise, I can't say I'm impressed either. It was just boring smacking these tiny little robots. Not because of the size or skill required, but it was closer to me rubbing my literal sword on them than trying to slash them. It felt bland, very very bland.And finally, on the matter of design choices, getting past the intro of the game itself is just a test of nerves. The game attempts a mixure of Souls-like deaths, meta-game endings and bullet-hell ""do it all again, no mid saves"" mentality, which translates to the size of 2-3 ""levels"" as a tutorial, and if you die you start from the beginning, not even skipping real-time cutscenes and dialogue. Honestly, this annoyed me the most. I ended up skipping like half of the enemies in the intro just because I was getting tired of it and wanted to save my progress. Again, that was just the intro of the game, and just that made me dislike my experience with it. Combine that with all the issues above and there was no way I could have opened the game again after that.CPU: AMD FX8350GPU: GTX 1070RAM: 16gbOS: win 64bitGame running from an SSD.All drivers up to date.

												Unplayable on Mouse and KeyboardNow, let me preface this by saying. Yes, I am aware that this, along with most spectacle fighters, are primarily supposed to be played on controller. Yes, I know Japanese games' checkered histories with PC port. I have successfully managed to play Dark Souls on keyboard and mouse, so I have a pretty good tolerance for this sort of thing.I'm also not going to get into the obvious graphical issues (clear upscaling, 4:3 resolution(the FAR fix didn't work for me), etc)I get a pretty bad feeling from the very beginning when the settings menu doesn't include any keybinding(Instead it's in a ""Controls"" section that you find with each save). In addition, menus are designed so that as long as you have your mouse hovering in the screen and not out of it, when you try to scroll using the mouse wheel, it is stuck to whatever you're hovering over. Then I get into the game itself. Ho boy. The default controls are a mess; very odd buttons all around, but nothing keybinding can't fix. For some reason the PC version has no evade button while the controller does? I don't even...In the twinstick shooter sections, it seems like the mouse has to act exactly like an analogue stick. So when you try to move in one direction, it tries to override you to point in that direction, unless you keep on moving the mouse to the other direction. No aiming reticule or anything to show where your cursor is, either.Camera control in third person is just abysmal as well. It's struggling just to move the camera, and there's no lock function like in Dark Souls. And again, no evade button - instead you doubletap keys. So I'm pretty damn frustrated, and I go to try and fix this a little in keybinding. And there's the final straw - you can't rebind your mouse controls. Only keyboard. Frankly, this is ridiculous. I expected some clumsy controls, maybe lack of mouse support in menus, but this is just unplayable on keyboard and mouse. I'll give the game a week or two to see if they come out with a patch(or a mod fix), and if not, I'm refunding the game, which is a shame, because I was very excited for this title.			"

Good way to waste 6 hours downloading only to play for 28 minutes most of which was spent in the menu trying to get full screen to work with duel-monitors.

												Everything about the game itself is amazing.But, this port has some major issues. Full screen mode is broken and renders at inccorect resolutions and anything above 1600x900 performance tanks HARD even though with my 980ti I should be able to to run this game at over 60 fps in 4k. If I can run The Witcher 3 maxed out with mods at <60 FPS in 3440x1440 I should be able to get double that in this game. I will update this review immediately after the issues are fixedUPDATE: It's been over two weeks now since release and all we've gotten is only a single vague statement and not even a ""1.01"" patch. Zip, nada. On average I'm getting 22 fps and 30 fps +/-2 with the FAR fan patch and my GPU overclocked 10% and fan profile set to max. Why haven't the developers pushed something similar out yet? 1 guy on the internet has already given the devs a 30% performance increase for free yet they themselves have only made a 3 sentence long statement. What a farce. Also lmao @ at all the drones downvoting negative reviews.

Half of the gameplay is not balanced at all with one move that can be performed at long range and instant-kills almost any enemy, knocking huge chunks of HP off everything else. I also can't complete the game because it contains an obnoxiously long segment with no save points and the game is not stable enough to avoid crashing for that long. Maybe get it on PS4 or after stability patches. Instability is one thing, but frequent crashes in a game that sometimes doesn't allow you to save for over an hour is a fun-ruining experience.			"

												----EDIT------After having the game crash several times on me, I decided to set the game to its default settings. After some testing, I found that turning on AA was the primarly cause of the issues stated below. There are still dead zones when using the mouse to control the camera, but the game is actually playable now. Some conclusions from turning off AA:-applying 2x AA multiplies the deadzone by a factor of 2, approximately-higher AA settings do the same-keyboard inputs are significantly more responsive when AA is off-texture filtering might have the same issues as AA----------------------------------------------------------------------------ORIGINAL POST----Keyboard and mouse controls for this port are genuinely ♥♥♥♥ing awful. If you do not have a gaming pad, do not buy this game.Explanation for kb+m:It seems like the game attempts to simulate the mouse as the analog stick (why Platnium thought this was a good idea is beyond me, or better yet why didn't play testers for this port say anything about it?). It does not work well at all. During the top-down and side-scrolling portions of the game, using the mouse is not ideal at all. In order to shoot in your intended direction, you have to continiously move your mouse in that direction at a relatively slow speed, or else the direction that you're attacking will reset to the direction of your movement or your aim will be off by an order of magnitude. Using the mouse for this game does not get any better in any section of the game. During the third person spectacle fighting portions of the game, using the mouse to control the camera is just downright infuriating. You cannot aim accurately or precisely. The camera never points where you want it to point. Even after modifying the atrocious default camera settings, moving the camera with the mouse is still awful.Camera movement is not dependent on the displacement of your mouse. The camera ONLY, and i emphasize, ONLY moves predictably if you move your mouse at a relatively slow speed (somewhere around an in/s). If you move your mouse any faster or slower than that speed, the camera barely even moves, especially if your using the default camera settings. The game doesn't even register speeds lower than that target speed as a proper input (again somewhere around an inch per second) because, as I've mentioned before, the game seems to simulate the mouse as an analog stick. Moving your mouse at a speed lower than the target speed is akin to hitting the deadzones of an analog stick. Slow mouse movement results in no camera movement. Too much movement ♥♥♥♥s with the camera-mouse logic and results in the camera moving a significantly lowered displacement.As for using the keyboard in this game, the one and only major issue I have with it is the lack of a separate key binding for dodging. Honestly, it makes no sense why there isn't a separate key binding for it. The ps4 version of this game has it, so it's not like dodging was only ever hard coded to double-tapping a directional key. To dodge using a keyboard, you have to double-tap a directional key. The problem with using a keyboard for this game is that dodging oftenly does not work. During combat, I've found myself frequently trying to spam dodge, but to no avail.

edit: apparently my review has been met with incredulity, I am adding this reddit link to show that I am not the only one experiencing those massive technical problems: https://www.reddit.com/r/nier/comments/600scm/nier_automata_pc_issues_megathread/ Technical DesasterAfter unsuccessfully evading the hype-train that has been going on for weeks, I downloaded this game.I will save you how pretty the graphics and the soundtrack are, enough people have written about it.Instead lets focus on the things that make this game utterly unplayable: The game does not understand more than one graphics card: I have an embedded Intel graphics chip and a GTX950. Sadly Nier only recognizes the first graphics chip. I had to manually disable the Intel chip for the Nvidia one to be recognized by the game Totally unaceptable performance: The movements feel like the protagonist is swimming in honey. The dialogue in the cutscenes is not at all syncronized with the lip movement (delay of up to 15 seconds). The combat is even worse because of that, it feels like playing a turn based game sometimes. Each action requires several key presses for the game to finally register it. This is most annyoing when the game throws multiple enemies at once, which happens all the time.This is not a problem with the hardware on my side, my setup is as follows:   Intel i7 6700 3.5GHz  32GB of DDR4 RAM  GTX 950 Graphics card with 4GB of vRAM  On top of that when minimizing the game or switching to another process, the game cannot be restored. The sounds continue to play and it is possible to hear that the menu is brought up if the corresponding key is pressed but the windows stays white. Not to mention that it is impossible to return to fullscreen mode for whatever reason. Completely unacceptable control scheme. The game seems to assume that it is being played on a console isntead of a PC. The default keybindings are hilarious. Basic attack requires 2 key pressed at once for example. There are not ways of configuring the mouse. I need 3 hands to play certain parts: it requires the w-a-s-d, the arrow keys and the mouse in very short succession. Instead of having 360° of freedom when facing enemies in the first level, the game only offers 8, as if a d-pad instead of a mouse was present. There is the possibilities between shot1 and shot2 yet it is not at all clear what exactly the difference is, if it exists at all. Some keys on the keypad (the default control scheme assumed by the game) do not have any keyboard equivalent at all. The list goes on, and consider that I only played a little over 1 hour.  Horrible Camera If you thought the camera from old cosole ports like Final Fantasy VII and VIII was bad, you will be overjoyed to find out that it is even worse in Nier: Automata. In a pathetic attempt to be ""innovative"" I assume, the game will frequently translate from one fixed and totally awkward camera angle into another fixed and even more awkward angle, oftentimes mid-battle. I found myself fighting against the camera much more often than fighting against the enemies. The few parts where the camera is really free and under the players control are like oasises in the midst of a desert.Savepoints: No savepoints whatsoever in over 1 hour makes Jack a dull boy.

												I am a frequent steam user with hundreds of games and experiences both good and bad. I'm not against controllers, but have a personal preference to using M+KB when the option is available. I love Nier and highly recommend both Nier and Nier Automata to fans of the franchise.TL;DR: This game suffers performance issues on 'recommended' specs and requires high end specs to function as intended; Refrain from purchasing on steam if you haven't a high end PC and a controller to play it with.M+KB controls are outright pitiful and border between just-usable to heavily-handicapped. People attribute the game's unique perspective changes to the state of M+KB controls but without listing titles this is not a strong enough excuse; Top/Side view shooting sections are restrained to hyper acute mouse aiming that misses frequently with no finesse available to the user. (The game's on-foot sections are somewhat playable, but sluggish default settings and possibly performance issues make this feel subpar compared to similar priced titles.)Performance is spotty; While not unplayable, if you aren't running on higher end specs you will likely have to either downsize or simply deal with performance drops due to un-optimized engine performance in areas.I still recommend Nier Automata for it's wonderful soundtrack and interesting gameplay. But the game is a pathetic port with limited accessibility.			"

												How am I supposed to progress in the game if it keeps crashing during the first mission? Without auto save I cannot pass this mission as the game crashes constantly and I haven't even gotten to the boss at the end of the first chapter. I am sitting on 3 hours of gameplay (at time of writing) and all of it is in the first chapter. I have been trying all of the tricks mentioned in the discussions to help me just get past this first chapter and so far none of them have been working.How did the devs not pick this up? Was there no PC testing done for this game? I've been waiting months for this game and here I am sitting in front of my PC dissapointed because this port is almost as bad the Batman Arkham Knight and is comparible to the first Dark Souls port.PC Speci5 7600K16GB RAMRadeon 480 XFX OC Black Edition			"

												If You have AMD Graphics good luck playing without back dating will not get past prologue and if do you will experince white screen or blank screen effect. Unless back date to a less optimized verison of the software which may make it very choppy. Not intrested in back dating myself and I'm not just talking air here as I will list my specs below, if the game was properly optimized is probably a great game but atm as of  3/21/2017 game is ♥♥♥♥ till square enix implements a patch for those of us amd users that have the latest drivers and software. Updating does not help at the current moment for fixing the issue the problem is in the game does not communicate properly with current software for amd as they seem to have it more set tords Intel/nvidia users as that is what the PS4 uses for hardware. So in other words unplayable the current moment would not recommend at the current moment if are AMD user like myself.My specs are:O/S: Windows 10 ProCPU: AMD FX-9590 Vishera 4.7ghz GPU: 3x XFX Radeon GTR RX 480 DirectX 12 CrossFireX Support Black Edition Video Card (OC)PSU: XFX ProSeries P1-1000-BELX 80+ PLATINUM CertifiedRam: 32GB of 8GB Ripjaws Z Series ram			"

												Fully cleared in 36 hours. Here is my review.Pros- Well made story.- Back Ground Music fits really well in most of situation.- Philosophical and moral questions to player, just like their last game.Cons- Aweful control system if you play with Keyboard and mouse. (If you use consol pad, you can ignore this sentence.)- Bug from several quests and some game logic error, Map stuck and extra.- Game crashes without any reason once in a while. (Win10, fully updates with ATI R9x series.)- In some stages and map, game toggle your point of view to fixed. Not all the time, but in several cases it's very annoying.- JRPG's play style. Bunch of grinds.- No online, network based open world. Not even a co-op mission. Which means lack of contents once you cleared whole story. <- It said single-player in game discription. Then why there is online mode and offline mode in game? Also why  there is invincible boss at E route when I play with offline mode? what's the purpose for this?Graphics : 3/5Story : 4/5Interface : 1/5(Keyboard) 4/5(controller)Stability : 2/5Contents : 2/5Overall : [2.4/5 (Keyboard)] [3/5 (Controller)]Conclusion I suggest this game for people who are big fan of JRPG and PlatinumGames Inc.The story and BGM are awesome. Made both of my eyes wet at the E-ending.If you are story based gamer I suggest you this game.However, if you are a gamer who wants several different contents after cleared story mission, there is nothing much to enjoy. Secret shop at resistance base will unlock all of your trophies(Acheivements in steam) for in game currency. Over priced. Not a worth for 80.00 CAD. 50 to 60 would makes sense.			"

												So get this. The game is absolutely fun. The hack and slash that Platinum games is more famous for (Among other ♥♥♥♥♥torms but we don't talk about those) And the Mix of Yoko Taro's mad mind in creating some pretty odd stories. This game seems like a real gem. And it is-- For anyone playing console.----------------------------------------------------------Allow me to be blunt, this port is AWFUL. While my computer reaches almost every bit of recommended settings (Save the graphics card, but that's only a 20 of the Nvidia card) I end up running this game as if I were trying to push an entire Garbage Truck on Neutral with my bare hands! I wish it were much of a joke, but Again, I'll be blunt: I don't reach even 30 FPS with everything at it's lowest off and on a resolution of 640x480. I can barely see the text as it starts to have disappearing pixels, but at least I can play this good game.Furthermore, while I'm lucky to not go through stuff other people are suffering (Crashes, Whitescreening, people not even able to run the game cause Denovo is missing) I did have my further misfortunes. Such as having the display of the game just jam... And then proceeding to artifact the entire screen of my computer.It's not fun to see half of your screen spazzing out and having no idea how to fix it, as you try to save both your computer hardware and software from what was really one giant flashy false alarm.I really want to enjoy this game as much as I can, and I already do. but one thing is for certain. If you look at the time I have been playing this game. My actual game time is half that. Because again, abysmal framerates kinda stagnate the entire flow fo the game. Oh and while I'm at it, I should mention the whole thing with Keyboard and Mouse. Now, I have grown used to awkward keyboard layouts, that's not something new, is it annoying I can't remap some of the actions to my mouse buttons? Kinda, but it's not the end of the world. Just. god. forbid. you Play some of the minigames with the keyboard and mouse. While the movement is fine and all, if you dare use the mouse to aim (in minigames, the core game doesn't have much of an issue) You'll rather want to just... leave the pointer as it is, as mouse movement is so sensetive and inaccurate you'll be thinking you were a drunk with a machinegun, on a tightrope.Again, this can be easilly resolved by using the arrow keys like a smart person who has alternate solutions to bad controls, but the precision aiming just wouldn't be there anymore, would it?Luckilly for everyone. There is a group of modders trying to fix it as well as the Dev team coming out to do Buxfixes. But until then, the thing stands as is.To those who are like me who own no consoles and I still don't sway you from buying the game. I hope your port doesn't end up abysmally as mine.To those who are enjoying the game to it's fullest extent, I'm glad there are people enjoying it without a niggling thought of agony.But to be perfectly frank? I get the distinct feeling, that if we got an emulator and this game. It would run better.So all and all: Don't got a console? I wish you luck it runs without issue. If you do. You're much better off buying the console version of this game.			"

												I preordered the game here on steam for 59,99€. Not only to support a franchise that finally made it to PC, but also to support japanese devs. The day it released i noticed the resolution is bugged and only sends a 4:3 1680x1050 image at 60 Hz at any given resolution to my monitor. As this only appeared in fullscreen i started to play in windowed mode only to find out that once i swing the sword there is a chance for the game to crash the graphics driver.The official tech Support recommended me to use an outdated driver from 2016 to avoid the crashes. But since i use new drivers and not obsolete ones, that never happened.Now almost 2 weeks later and with the best intentions in mind, there is still no official patch to address the well known issues. And after having forwarded all the important information to both - the Tech Support and AMD for the graphics driver - i see no reason to wait longer for a patch that could or could not happen.Instead i go for a refund and spend my money on other products, that actually work.

												Game is probably really fun, if you can play it.If you have an AMD card, or an Nvidia 700 series card, beware. Game has an issue where it just crashes out of nowhere on them. AMD users can downgrade the driver, no known fix for Nvidia users atm.I haven't been able to play for more than 20 minutes without it crashing, so I haven't even been able to complete the intro and save my game. Crashing doesn't seem to have any relation to what is happening on screen, it just happens randomly.Also the game has similar problems to Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, where it doesn't respect what resolution you tell it to run at. It seems to choose some weird res's, different from what you actually select. Like: 1080p, game runs at 1768x992 which my display only supports at 30Hz. If I choose 1600x900 it runs at 1680x1050, which isn't even the same aspect ratio.Basically port is a mess, don't buy till they fix it.			"

												Every one I know loves this game, and I love kick ♥♥♥ sexy women and dystopian epics. Which might make it strange why I hated this. It basically boils down to art style, visuals, graphics, and gameplay. I don't watch much anime or get into their way of doing things, cause I don't understand it. Frills, skirt, and high heels seemed very odd choices for a combat android, and the quirky, clunky robots, some of which with cultural mimicry undertones took away what would have been a cold, threatening alien menace.A bit of freeflight would've been nice but all the flight sequences were prescripted and oriented like an 80's shooter arcade. I don't care for nostalgia gaming. Seeing the flying units in previews, I thought it would've added a nice, strategic depth with options to either fight on ground or in the air, but they were just kept to certain sequences. I found the melee combat untactical and pretty boring, just frantic, twitch bullet hell. Not to mention immersion breaking UI, glowing items that looked like Mario coins, subtitles and letter boxes you can't get rid from the menu (I heard you needed to equip an item?) A lot of this comes down to personal taste as opposed to actual quality, but these little nitpicks added up, especially when the world, story, and characters didn't grasp me to the point I could overlook these annoyances. This usually comes to be the case with me and Japanese games, but I'm willing to give things a try. In the two hours I had before requesting a refund it didn't win me.			"

												If you have and like to use a controller, please disregard this review!This has the dubious honour of being my first steam refund.The game opens with a shootemup sequence somewhat reminiscent of old classics like Xenon 2 and R-Type which works OK. but when the perspective shifts and the game moves to more of a twinstick shooter approach, it all falls apart for mouse and keyboard controls.At this point, you can either use the mouse to control shooting which *should* work but, for some reason, the devs chose to make it so you fire in the direction your mouse is moving (rather than at a crosshair) which means you have to keep moving the mouse to fire in one direction.The alternative is to use keyboard for controlling fire direction but that gives you too little control over where you're shooting.3rd person works better but my concern is that there will be too many unplayable sections due to control issues.

												The pc version do not work, the lack of a proper save system also means there is no way to reach the save point as the game will crash before you can get to it.I do not recommend this game until they fix it.Right now this is just expensive garbage.No idea the cause of my white crash issue, but if you got windows 10, i7-4820k, 16GB Ram and GTX TITAN Black like me then i suggest you save your money for something that works or buy the console version cause this ♥♥♥♥ does not work.If you still feel like taking the chance, check out the forum first to see if your specs are doable or not.Window mode seems to make it playable for me but not everyone.

												As much as I liked it on console, this is one of those cases when I'd recommend to steer clear of PC version. Denuvo controversy aside, the game runs badly on both low- and high-end PCs i have around the house(one being a cheap i3/650ti and other being an i7/1070); as an added bonus there are some oddities with kb/m control scheme and general gamepad behavior anomalies which aren't as critical as performance but still can screw you over.This is an early release review, yes, but bear in mind - this is a Platinum game and they never actually change anything significant after release because they still operate on old ""polish - release - only fix critical faults"" mentality. Especially when it comes to PC releases.			"

												Being a fan of the first NieR, I was greatly anticipating the release of NieR: Automata.  While the gameplay of Automata feels fun and engaging, the game itself is completely unplayable for me due to technical issues.  I have yet to complete the first level of the game because it has a high chance of randomly locking up my whole computer while in combat, forcing me to hard reset.  And most disappointingly, no apparent movement has been made on the developer's part to fix the problem.  So, to sum it all up, I'd love to share my opinions on the game, but I suppose I can't, since to do that, I'd have to be able to play it first.			"

A bad port of a good game.Listen, there's a lot of buzz surrounding this game so let's keep it honest here. As a game Nier Automata is borderline amazing but flawed: From an artistic perspective it is Incredibly strong in everything from attractive character designs to its amazing soundtrack, it is backed by an author that has always been good with delivering interesting (although not exactly coherent) stories but when it comes to gameplay it is saddled down with a pointless open world and combat that's relatively fun but takes AGES to get anywhere near as interesting as other Platinum titles (the good ones, that is) thanks to piling up system upon system upon system. Nier can be engrossing, it's refreshingly quirky, it's full of stylish visuals (terrible textures aside) and set pieces but if you want a perfect example of a game that's held aloft not only by its own merits but (some would say underserved) hype then you should look no further: Nier Automata is a perfect storm of kooky underdog creator, a developer that's supposed to be a master in action games (yet kind of fails to deliver, specially considering things like how normal mode is far too easy while hard will have most enemies one shot you), a genre that's seldom seen in modern games (especially on PC) and a mountain of erotic drawings and webms of sashaying androids.Is it worth a play? Yes. Is it worth sixty dollars? Weeeelllllll that's kind of the issue here... because the port is ♥♥♥♥ing awful and people are swallowing it up anyway. HORRIBLE performance that will force most people to play well under 60 FPS (in a game that was explicitly designed to be 60 FPS), bugs that range from a completely broken fullscreen mode to inevitable crashes/freezes, poorly encoded cutscenes that hitch all the time and the bare minimum effort to present many features PC users need - like more than a handful of graphic settings or sensible KB/M controls (you should really own a gamepad at this point but whatever); The PC version of NieR: Automata was clearly a project overseen either by inexperienced people or Square Enix didn't give a damn because this thing falls waaaaay below what's expected of port quality. People will immediately rush to comment ""but it works fine for me!"" except it doesn't - and I guarantee that anyone that might claim they can play the game ""without issues"" is either happy with mediocre FPS, blissfully unaware of how it's actually running on their rig or the rare 1% of the population that have 1200 dollars worth of videocards in their weird frankenstein machine (I mean even the PC Gamer reviewer noticed drops into the 45 FPS with a GTX Titan for god's sake. Geforce 980s struggle with a steady 60 FPS at 1080p even with low settings? Come on now.)  It is quite simply unnaceptable that a game that looks as shabby as NieR does takes more hardware than any other full fledged open world game OR explosion filled action game out there and the fact that so many people are ok with it is kind of appaling.""But Det!"" you might say, dunce cap precariously balanced on your head, ""Nier is a small franchise! It's no wonder Square didn't devote money to it!"" Well if Sega was able to do an amazing port of Valkyria Chronicles without issues then there is no excuse, now is there? Not when the team behind Nier themselves explicitly mentioned in interviews that the PC version came first and THEN they scaled down to PS4. The only thing people are doing by accepting ports like these are allowing the Koei Tecmo's and Warner Brother's of the world to keep delivering ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ports.Is there hope that the game will be patched? No idea. At the very least I imagine the fullscreen thing will be patched (surprise, it was already fixed by a modder well-known for fixing japanese games) but I think performance issues will be much harder to tackle, who knows about the crashes on some hardware. The long and short of it is that if you buy into this game right now, you are buying into a terrible gamble that may not pay off and frankly it is not really worth it either for your own immediate benefit nor the growing tendency to deliver bad ports because PC's better hardware is supposed to make up for whatever corners lazy developers cut.Don't. Buy it on console if you must, wait and see if this gets patched or just get it five years down the line when it'll be 10 bucks and our future space computer parts will be able to run it properly.

												Now I REALLY want to give this a thumbs up, and not just cause 2B is one of the sexiest robots I've ever seen, but I can't for one reason and one reason alone. Optimization is REALLY BAD with this game, even with a graphics card inbetween minimum and recommended. I have an nVidia Geforce 930M graphics card and 8GB of RAM, by all requirements I should be able to play this at low-medium quality with no problems, but I could not get more then like 10 FPS while walking and 15 while in the mech. I had to go do a lot of tweaking with the nVidia control panel and the game in lowest quality to even make it playable. I still dont get even 30 fps, barely over 20 at the best parts and subtitles are lagged as is some cutscenes. Now I have a budget gaming laptop admittingly but when the minimum for this game is close to a game like Fallout 4 a bit, and I can run that fine on low-medium I should by all means be able to play this nearly the same but it's impossible without a lot of tweaking. I want to recommend this game but until they fix it's optimization for PC you better have a graphics card super close to the recommended at the minimum, or your better off getting this on console. If square fixes it to run smoother on PC without a bunch of tweaking, espescially on laptops I will change this to recommended. If you have a beastly computer or laptop though this game is worth it. Oh and also as a warning you're not gonna be able to save for a bit cause you can't till your done the first mission/level whatever and there is no autosave feature. Also the recommened storage space is total bs right now, I have the Day One Edition andf its smaller then 30GB I think it was 26GB or 28GB so don't worry about space, it's not as big as GTAV or newer CoD games contrary to what it says on the store page.

												Update, since I bought game. Some crusial things are not fixed yet. Support is very poor. I mean, there is no support, except thanks msg nothing appeared for to long. I am almost sure, if this stay for more than 2 weeks, my recommendation wont change, leaving only mark for ""worst supporter. Almost like No Man Sky. Do not recommend only for the support cause""That's hard. Game is great! Yeah. Great multilevel gameplay, story is pretty nice (I hope).But there are some critical bugs, that are forcing me to put negative. And I am developer too, I do not tolerate apps with so obvious bugs like here that was released. NEVER. I hate day 1 patch thing etc. I do prefer delays, instead of giving ppl (ofc not free, but charging them) broken thing.. so yeah:1. Resolution bug2. Everytime minimize, windowed mode restored.3. Weird FPS drops during cutscenes (have 50-60 [that thanks to editing config file, cause yea, without I would have 30 max, and 15 during cutscenes.. - do not understand the logic why it is blocked..] during boss fights, but when main character clench her fist, I have drop to 15FPS? Everytime, reloaded this moment 3 or more times. And that's not the only one moment. Somehow cutscenes are really bad made).4. After getting out from bunker elevator weird things happens. Cant run right/left on my pad. Fixed by clicking keyboard button (Whaaaat?). But there was workaround, now, that pushed me the most to put this negative: Now after leaving elevator in bunker, I have to reset game, cause running again does not work left/right and keyboard does not help. Nor camera works at all, so somehow my character run behind camera ...			"

												The game is ok, it isn't great and I wouldn't personally recommend it but it is not terrible.Pros:*The world is well thought out and the story makes sense(mostly). As you play the game you will get to learn more and more about the world and everything falls into place*While it has it's flaws, the combat system is fun for the majority of the game. There are times when the game disables one or more of your basic abilities (sometimes all of them) though which detract from overall gameplay*There is a lot of developer humor in the game with a lot of easter eggs, you are free to make unconventional choices and see what happens as a resultCons*The game is rather short. The game is very linear and doesn't contain a lot of playtime. With about 30 hours of gameplay I've unlocked every main ending and all misc ""endings"" except for one.*There doesn't seem to be any endgame content. The game is purely story driven and once you've cleared the game in all possible ways, you start over against level 1 mobs as if nothing ever happened.*When the game tries to get emotional, it often gets cringy. I understand the whole ""androids developing human emotions"" bit, but when it is well established that the androids reboot from backups, it makes some death scenes pointless. To further this point, the main characters both kill themselves as early as the tutorial.*You often find yourself running around holding one button. The POD firing button is just a free source of damage and the fact that you basically spend the entire game holding it down makes for mindless combat especially since the number of mobs you usually fight at once makes melee significantly more risky.All things considered it is a good game, it is merely not what it's hyped up to be and probably not worth the $60 price tag. I expect more than a weekend of play time from a game I drop that much money on. If you find this game on sale then I'd get it, otherwise you might as well wait.			"

												After playing through this game once, I need to get some things off my chest about this game, as I have very mixed feelings about it.Yes, the game is a low effort port and you will definitely notice it. Yes, playing without a 2 stick controller is just not going to do, so don't try this with keyboard / mouse. But that's not why I'm not recommending this game.First impressions were very good, the game has something from a lot of games. It's a mix of Space Invaders, Dark Souls, Bayonetta, Furi and all of that in a fast paced action JRPG. Also notice that it's from the makers of Metal Gear Rising Revengeance and Bayonetta. The story starts very intriguing about what it means to be human and life in a post-apocalyptic world of robots, so it seemed like my kind of game and I really wanted to like it.About the setting:The game tries to be as realistic as possible and even explain elements of the game (e.g. UI, respawning, saving) in their robot setting, which seems very cool at first, but gets very stale after a while when you start noticing its obvious flaws and limits - from plot to gameplay. I was constantly left wondering: Why don't they just do that and avoid the whole problem altogether? Why is this even relevant? Unfortunately most of the almost philosophical topics from the start are just never touched on again and then the story doesn't even follow its own rules sometimes for the sake of being more dramatic...About the gameplay and difficulty:If you play on normal or easy, it is a very enjoyable experience. You will feel very overpowered, enjoy hack and slay styled combat the way it is supposed to be played and everything is fine.If you want a challenge and try the game on hard (there is also super hard where you always die in one hit), you just get ♥♥♥♥ed over so much. The game isn't really hard, but unfair and very punishing. With the ridiculous level scaling you will get oneshot by everything a few levels above you and even the cheapest mechanics. With the no autosave mechanic, you will sometimes have to replay whole levels again just to try once more. And good luck getting to your corpse (this alone can take a while) and standing still for 3 seconds in the middle of enemies that already killed you and without your equipment. If you die again, you loose your equipment forever, at which point you can basically reset the game. After a lot of grinding, because even the available side quests are 20 levels above you and not a valid xp ressource, when you outlevel the enemies even just slightly, the game is basically the same as normal and way too easy. The balancing really just isn't good. There would definitely be a line between super hard and way too easy, but the developers couldn't find it.About the game world:The way the story and world is designed feels more like a low effort MMO to me. You will see most of the zones (only 5) in the game very quickly and then get sent to the same places over and over again. Many sidequests are very simple go here, kill that type quests and aren't even voiced. I really just expected more.For one playthrough the amount of content might be fine, but as you may know, they expect you to play the game up to 5 times to get the full story. Considering that even the first playthrough is very repetitive, down to even most of the bosses repeating and the second playthrough being 90% the same as the first one, this is just low effort design to me. Rehashing the same content as many times as you possibly can is not what I want in a game and I already got tired of it during my first playthrough.Also the first main ending (A) you get after playing through the whole game once isn't even a motivating ending. You get no explanations, no epilogue, no foreshadowing, no motivation, nothing. They just cut out during a regular scene and you just casually start all over again and to get more info you basically have to play it at least 3 times.Summary:Even though I initially enjoyed the setting and most of the gameplay, over the course of the game, as I started noticing all the flaws, limits and the dwindling quality, my motivation was fading. So much of the game seems to be lazily put in and not thought through. The same content just gets dragged out and repeated multiple times. Adding the bad port on top, I unfortunately cannot justify recommending this game. It wasn't the worst game I ever played, but it wasn't good either.			"

												I was fairly hyped for this game and decided to get it on my pc because it's more powerful than my ps4, little did i know it would run worse no matter what I did for settings, I am disappointed because my pc can handle many other new games on high-medium settings with a stable 60 fps, this game i can barely get my fps above 50 with settings on minimum and a decreased resolution.  Until it gets fixed i cannot recommend this, because my personal experience is less than desirable when compared to the ps4's performance			"

Figured.I want to recommend this game, but unless you use a controller, you're on to a very unpleasant ride on PC.So, NOT RECOMMENDED because of poor PC port.			"

It does not get boring just because of that though, all the perspective shifts and scenarios spice up the game just perfectly.			"

												I bought this game thinking surely on lowest settings i would at least get 30 frames per second on my msi apache pro gaming laptop. well I tried that and guess what even after dropping down to a quater of my screen resolution and on lowest graphical settings I think it is safe to say I cannot play this game. Black desert Online with max settings has better frame rate than this game, and thats realy saying something considering its online and can have up to 50 players o the screen at once. The game seems fun, but i cant play it becuase its optimised to poorly, i played the start 4 times over to get the settings to a point where the begining was playable, i hoped that once i get outta the bullet hell begining that the frames may fix themselfs and was wrong. If I had known that it would be like this i would never have bought it, that being said if you have a computer with quite litterally the best possable gear, than sure you will probably love this game. but as it stands im gonna have to leave this game till something in the next few years if win loto and get myself at least a high grade pro gaming computer.

												If I have one comment about Nier it is that it is severly overhyped. In full disclosure I went into this game expecting it to be ""the most important game of the year"" as quoted by Jim Sterling but to say the least I was disappointed. The game covers some interesting topics and the combat starts off interesting and satisfying but after a few hours becomes a bore. The story has some interesting metaphors and covers some Personhood positions and other existential philisophical topics but the writing and the voice acting make it hard to care. The characters other than 9S feel tired or just boring or hillariously cliche. The villians especially made me laugh a few times with their over the top, anime dub like delivery. You may enjoy that but personally the story feels like someone checking off every cliche in the book. It does do some interesting perspective changes and some interesting things with it and I could get into the story if the combat wasn't such a repeititive bore. The gameplay includes running from objective to objective either to talk to someone, get something to trigger a story bit, or to fight a boss, all while killing robots in between. The NPCs all sound tired  or bored so having interactions with them is just uninteresting, the story bits are alright as I explained before, but the bosses become so repetitive its kind of hillarious. Each boss either creates a shockwave, shoots purple balls, or swings at you. Theres little variation passed this. You quickly find a strategy of killing them that basically works on every one of them. This ties into the combat for me. I had never played a Platinum Games game before so I had no idea how their combats worked in their previous games, but if they are anything like this one I honestly don't get why they get so much praise. In the combat you have 5 moves you can do; a light attack, heavy attack, ranged attack, spell, or dodge. There is not much variation in the combos for the light and heavy attacks and because you're fighting hordes of guys you will often get stopped mid-combo by an enemy off screen which becomes quickly frustrating. I ended up having to just spam the spells and ranged attacks while non-stop dodging in order to get many of the hordes of enemies killed. This also applies to the bosses, you can literally dodge any attack by bosses by circling around them and mashing the dodge button and since you have an unlimited ranged attack you never have to come near them so you can keep circling and shooting till they are dead. Its embaressing.I think what bothers me the most about Nier is that its not a bad game but even though is simply an average game thats ""meta"" or a ""game about games"" and because of this somehow becomes better. This is obviously being pushed by a group of individuals that feel the need to put gaming on a pedastal so that its ""better"" or ""just as good"" as other mediums. This game shows a lot of insecurities in gamers and their lack of confidence in their hobby. This is not a good game, its a pretentious meta piece about games in games, and honestly I'm tired of this genre. Games are to have fun don't try to pretend like they have to be art and that will make the game great. The game doesn't even utilize gameplay to extend its ideas. The gameplay and story are completely seperated, its contradictory.  You can have a good story or be 'meta' but don't forget you're making a GAME and there is GAMEPLAY which shouldn't be forgotten.

												Eh, Not everyone's cup of tea.-Galaga bullet hell sections are annoying. -Combat is alright, a lot of mashing dodge and light attack, but combos look nice.-Visuals are nice if you can run them, High presets of a Gtx 770 netted 7 fps at 1080p, but bumping a few setting down got me to 37~43, and windowed 900p into the the stable 53~60 fps.-As I didn't play all the way through and ended up refunding, I can't speak to the plot.

												Awful, awful port. 20~ FPS during cutscenes on a decent rig at 1440p (980TI, 4970K 4.0 Ghz) with dips down to 10 FPS on certain boss fights. The game can become literally unplayable because enemy projectiles are not telegraphed at lower frame rates. Playing with a M+KB is a terrible thing all on its own. When aiming from a top down perspective you need to constantly move your mouse in the direction you want to fire, otherwise it resets back to the default position. The Dodge mechanic is bound to double tapping WASD and cannot be changed to anything else. This game demands a gamepad if you plan on playing it more than once. The game also crashes often.

												I've played for an hour. I thought the graphics were nice, the character design too. The mechanics were clear, if slightly confusing. This is sadly all I will be able to say.Also, why are all the other pilots too stupid to evade the obvious red particles in front of them? You would think they'd choose the best.The sound is also a bit off, everything plays before the animation comes.My main reason why I'm giving this a negative review is because after more than an hour of playing, I had gotten to the double-chainsaw fight. I died. The save file looked normal, I hope that it would put me back in the fight, because I had spent a whole hour getting through the arduous hack and slash and tutorial parts. But no, they put me back in the beginning, doomed to see the rest of the squad die like morons once more, doomed to repeat everything including the tutorial. No, I refuse to play this. And I didn't even get close during that fight, so I'll most likely die again and waste two, three maybe four hours, just to get past the damn prologue and MAYBE find a saving site. I will not stand for this.			"

												Buggy rubbish. Keyboard and mouse is attrocious. Clearly no one had played the game with KB/H after putting in the KB/H code. You need 3 ♥♥♥♥ing hands to play with KB/H. No patch in sight. Apparently the console has received many patches. PC has received none. There are simple bugs that would have been seen way before release. But it was not fixed. Stay away from this game unless you are comfortable with a controller.I am totally disgusted with the devs support for the PC version. As such, not recommended. These ♥♥♥♥♥ can kiss my ♥♥♥♥en ♥♥♥.

Story — 2/10Character Development — 1/10Music — 8/10Battle System — 2/10Graphics — 5/10Story seems like it was written by some teenager in middle school. It doesn't know where it is or where it's going. Character development is sloppy. It tries to deliver a certain character, then changes that minutes after, making it hard to like the characters in any way, because they themselves don't keep a narrative or know how to build up characters. The music was fine, but nothing that I would call a masterpiece.The battle system is recycled and used in almost every hack n' slash I've played, but then that very system fails you when you face bosses. It ends up feeling jerky and cumbersome.If you look past 2B's buttocks, and at the world, it looks like trash. They didn't even try to make textures. It looks like a game from the PS3, with chroma filters masking how trashy it looks. This is not terrible, but not what I was expecting for a game in 2017. Is this what console peasants have become accustomed to?So, below is my huge rant against the game outside of the issues above and more details on why I dislike different aspects of the game.I uninstalled and requested a refund after 3 hours. It's just not for me. Most games I enjoy keep me interested within the first hour to something. The characters, the world, something. I got none of that. So, if you're expecting that I be nice to this game in some form or another, you're not going to get it.First thing that I noticed was that they over did it on the switch back and forth between camera angles. Once in a while, I get it, but not every 3 minutes. When going up stairs? Sure, I get that, makes the environment more dynamic, but corridors or anywhere they feel like it only makes it seem like they just don't want to make a fully 3D world, or draw the assets for it. It became repetitive and redundant real quick and I started hating that aspect of it early on.They probably spent too much time on 2B, because all the other female NPCs are all the same, with some differences between models. (In the ship, not outside with the resistance) I just feel like 2B got more time than necessary and the other characters took a hit for it.Character and story wise, 2B contradicts herself minutes after making a statement ""Emotions are prohibited"", which means that they're supposed to be robots, and emotions aren't normal, but obviously it's extremely normal for them and they blatantly show these emotions everytime they talk, die, attack, everything. The game literally tries to set a preface, doesn't follow it, tries to make a plot point, then contradicts itself and everything in it contradicts the message they're trying to convey. Another thing about it is that it tries to make you believe it's a post-apocolyptic modern society. A society that had enough means of technology to go to the moon and create life-like androids, but then proceeds to show you in cinematics, and in-game these old ancient 1960-1970s vehicles rusted and lying around, like I'm supposed to believe it's a modern world, but then tries to be Fallout or some crud. It makes no sense. —Also, I managed to relay this thing that bothered me to a friend who has beaten the game multiple times, and he tried to explain the story logic behind it, but still didn't add up. I decided to read up more about Nier (the game preceeding this one), only to find out that Nier is spinoff from another game ""Drakengard"". One of it's endings, specifically ending D, was supposed to lead up to Nier. The events in Drakengard ending D, which fast forward the antagonist to 2003 Tokyo and does some bad stuff (not ruining the story for people). However, 2003 does not equal 1950s, or 1960s. There is literally no reason for the object to exist, and it seems like Yoko Taru doesn't know how to create a narrative, stick with it, and not convolute it.I'm not a fan of the controls for keyboard, which would be the porter's fault, not the devs, but that and the random dashing on keyboard makes the battle system sloppy for PC. After I leave the main hour, forced battles(the <tutorial?>), it turned off auto healing and didn't even warn me. The AI is pretty dumb. I was killing level 15s at level 5The old ♥♥♥ textures make it seem like a game developed between 2008-2010. (This is everything on highest settings mind you.) The best textures were literally 2B and 9s(kinda), that's it. Nothing else had nearly as much attention, and I don't like the chromatic camera, or whatever the hell they're doing.The open-world isn't very open, I feel like I'm limited to a small city with a few buildings and caves(not really), and immediately nothing exciting is going on, the game becomes dull immediately after being semi-entertaining.Everything about it just bothers me in every aspect. I try to be a connoisseur of many forms of art (animations, game design, programming, story writing), and every part of me is bothered by every aspect. First it was abusing the camera angles. Good in theory, okay in practice, redundant when over used. Second was the battle system. It was not made to handle large battles in an ergonomic manner. Here I am trying to hold shift, move, and have a lock on, only for the large digger arm to swipe me and pummel me. When I had two on me, I was still doing ""okay"", but then 2B will randomly dash to one side, because of moving too fast and run into one arm when I was trying to move between them. After the whole thing, setting the bad story elements and that aside, it proceeds to put you in a 2D side view of her room, and the corridor at a completely different angle, but then puts you into the main center in 3D, and all the while my brain is cringing trying to get through it and the overlay of grey and chrome/black and white effect. Whilst not being consistant at all, I had hoped, ""hey, maybe when I get outside into the world that will change"".  Nope, it doesn't change. It has just grey chroma, which gives me a headache, and the brightness does ♥♥♥♥ to help that. Then I just see more repeats of the same enemies and textures being reused in one area, and everything looks the same all over. I don't have objectives on my hud(Didn't disable that), so I walked around for a good 30-50 minutes just killing things and retrieving the bodies of dumbasses that die to easy-peasy mobs, and getting a chuckle at how people are bad at video games. Finally get back to the resistance camp and you can buy an unlimited amount of health items pretty well, taking away any challenge the game could have had. (Outside of bosses anyway)If they spent less time on 2B's ♥♥♥ and more on story, AI, and battle ergonomics, they'd have a game worth playing, but still have a limited camera and silly filters going on. I just don't see 2B's ♥♥♥ justifying a $60US/$80 CAD price tag. You need an actual game to go with it. I am sure many enjoy it, but I just don't see any merit to it.			"

												This is one of the most horribly optimized PC games in recent memory. Do not buy this game in its current state unless you have a VERY solid rig to brute force solid performance. This is not a graphically impressive game, and while that's absolutely fine, it means that with a bit of effort in the porting process it could have been made to run well on pretty much anything from the last four years. It's a Platinum hack-n-slash - it deserves 60fps performance.As it stands, good luck getting above 40fps on anything but a high-end graphics card. And make sure to grab the unofficial global illumination fix if you want anything better than a slideshow. Unacceptable.			"

												I wish I could put a neutral stance on this, but I can't. The gameplay is pretty solid and fluid, albeit with the small frame 'hitch' now and then in certain areas but otherwise main game would run at 60FPS fine. The full-screen issue was an affliction for myself, so I had to run it windowed with a 3rd party application to get pseduo-borderless window mode with window, which should not have been an issue in the first place but it worked.The thing that broke it for me were the FMV cutscenes dropping frames like crazy when they shouldn't have been. Seriously, 30FPS FMVs have more problems than 60FPS gameplay? How? I even bothered to dump the FMVs and played them uncompressed in a player, and they ran just fine that way! It's something in the game that's messing up the playback of them.Also of note, is the GPU would drop to like 5% use on the FMV cutscenes and then back to ~80-100% in-game. So there's really something wonk with the game's video playback method, or a sync issue is happening.If you are the few that can get it to run flawless in all regards, congrats. As for me, refunded for now until at least the FMV stuff is addressed because that is way too jarring and there's over 100+ FMVs in the game. (Why does a game even use FMVs created obviously from the game's engine anyway? Why not just have had them play out in-game in the first place?)(Also of note, the FMVs are in 4:2:0 profile of YUV, limited colour range at 1600x904.)			"

Finished game (5 ""Main"" endings) on Normal difficulty. PC Port Notice I'm not gonna go into how terrible and lazy this port is. Needless to say, stay the hell away from it till it's fixed or heavily discounted even if you disagree with my gameplay review that follows. Most of the big issues with the PC Port could be found within the first 10 minutes by anyone in Squeenix, Platinum or any of the 50 other companies that worked on this game (thanks Ending E for having me sit through all of it!). Overall ImpressionsOverall, the game isn't bad. It's not great, but not terrible either. It is ""Mediocre""... it doesn't really excell at anything it does. Uninspired and mediocre gameplay, terrible port, cliche story that is too full of itself contribute to my negative recommendation here.I will say however that I think this game is totally worth it at the $30-40 pricepoint.Open WorldThe Open world and general design of the map is quite lackluster. It's never really a joy to explore the world as a lot of it feels outdated and very much packed to the brim with invisible walls. On top of this, there's an ocean, a jungle, an amusment park, a freaking desert all a short walking distance from eachother. Map cohesion isn't a huge issue to me but it is obvious enough in this title.The region design, apart from the Amusment Park wasn't anything extraordinary, you'd find the same stuff in majority of games that feature such areas. Amusment park gets a pass as it isn't something I've seen many game include.Overall, the world is just there, nothing too amazing but it gets the job done.CombatWhile it is a Platinum game, it unfortunately doesn't quite stand out from any of the rest of their games. It tries to mix it up with different modes, the pods and so on but I think that detracts from the game. One character in particular doesn't even really need to attack since he can hack everything.My main problem with the combat is that there is not enough of it! The game feels like it has to point out how smart it is in including an R-Type mode with the flight unity and an Asteroids wanna-be with it's Hacking and those 2 segments feel far more involved than the combat. Specially then one of the characters basically hacks his way through almost 2 playthroughs! Many people call this ""Unique"" or ""Innovative"" or whatever. But the game is basically in a constant identity crisis that feed it's mediocrity. I feel the multitude of combat modes would not detract from the rest of the game if they were removed or lessened. There is absolutely no reason you have to spend almost a third of the game hacking or in R-Type mode and it offers very little to the overall immersion. The game could do without them and lose nothing.In any case however, the actual character combat is quite basic for a hack and slash to the point where I could very well say Metal Gear Rising, Devil May Cry and others do it far better. I would love to say that this game's combat makes it stand out, but unfortunately it does not. It can't even hold it's own against other Platinum games.With the exception of using R-Type and hacking as fillers, combat is OK but nothing special here.GameplaySeperate from the combat issues, this game wants to pass itself for a Roleplaying game. As it has become a matra, this game is not really that great at it. There's nothing new in here, you get quests that tell you to go somewhere, do something, come back.There's quite a few quests to do, if you are into that kind of thing, as well as equipment upgrades. Though on this latter one... you honestly don't need them unless you want to get the achievement.Game also features a leveling system which comes into play if you manage to get yourself underleveled compared to the area you are in. I personally haven't had any issues like that and overall maybe died 4 times total. If you find yourself underleveled in a boss fight, you can always try to resurrect a fallen player's body from one of the multitude of piles (don't worry, they regenerate) and have them fight for you. Moment an ally attacks a boss they get the enemy's full attention leaving you open to regenerate, loot or do whatever.Map traversal also comes under gameplay so let's talk a bit about it. The game's movement is... basic. You can sprint around, jump and glide. If you have access to the functionality as well as the required destination point you can teleport to it as well which will save you a lot of time. Beyond that however, the game misses out on doing anything cool with it's open world in terms of how you can travel around it. I generally found myself sprinting around a lot to go from one objective to the next.Bosses generally end up being bullethell fights where the boss spawns a silly amount of bullets that you have to dodge. There's nothing in the boss combat itself that makes them memorable or even enjoyable to some extend. Some look good until you realise you can pretty much find them in other games. One of them is basically Encydna from Devil May Cry 4, another is pretty much a Goobue from Final Fantasy with an additional pair of arms and on and on it goes. There hasn't been a boss I haven't seen similar in another game.Game doesn't do anything great in terms of gameplay. It's not bad enough for me to say it's terrible but it does not do anything to stand out.AudioThis one splits into two areas, SFX, Voice Over and Soundtrack. I'll begin with the SFX even though it's not really a long topic at all.The game's sound effects are good, I don't think I ever heard anything that felt out of place when moving around or fighting. Ofcourse, if I had then that would speak volumes about the game (yeah, pun warning!).The VO actually holds up quite well! I have nothing to say about this, it's not at a level of some other games but it gets the job done quite well.A lot of people seem to be raving over the soundtrack but personally I found it lackluster. The vast majority of it is forgetable and even is just repeated with small variations (eg. ""This cannot continue"" vs ""We become gods""). It has some good tracks in there but it's not a Metal Gear Revengeance, a Persona or an Ar No Surge. Mediocre overall except from a tiny selection.GraphicsIgnoring the terrible port, this game has graphical issues. The characters look amazing but that is about all that looks amazing in the game.Low-poly modes, low resolution textures and the game overall looks like something out of the mid PS3 era. The only thing that makes it seem ""next-gen"" is it's love for particle effects as so many developers simply can't get enough of lately.Overall, graphics are nothing to write home about except from the main characters that actually feel like they had effort put behind them.StoryLeft this one for last and I know I'll be getting a lot of hate from Taro fanboys. Unfortunately, this one left me unimpressed as hell. I have no stake in Nier or Drakengard series. I have only played this and its story is quite lackluster. It's in similar vein to Ghost in the Shell and other works. Nothing in this game's story surprised me or even kept me interested in the slightest. I've seen it all before and I have seen it done far better.On top of this the game has a few logic and plot holes that are there just so it can seem smart or make things happen. Sometimes the story doesn't even play by it's own rules and it comes up with some excuse as to why that is.Overall, game is way too quick to try and show you how smart it is and rub it in your face which makes a pretty pretentious story with obvious symbilisms even more obnoxious to slog through.Complete disinterest and even annoyance at the story being so full of itself at times really made playing this game a complete slog.Nothing actually new in this story that hasn't been done before a bunch of times already.

												I (really) times (5) want to recommend this game. Saddly, there are too many preformance problems for me to be able to. I have installed the mod that supposedly fixes the framerate but that didn't seem to work so I went back and installed the test version with no improvements. Supposedly the developers are working on fixes right now, so wait until those are available. Right now though, either get it on the PS4 or wait until the patch is out. I'll recommend this game when everything is fixed. Sorry Nier/Drakengard fanboys :(			"

												A damn shame.Nier is a fantastic game up until about 30% of the way through, where it suddenly falls apart. The steady stream of new enemies, areas, and music stops, and it becomes a repetitive grind until the end, with poorly designed and unfun padding being forced down your throat at every turn.Despite the game's brilliant beginning, it only makes the late game that much more depressing. No way I can recommend this at full price.			"

												Pros: Beautiful looks and i love the charcter for obvious reasonsLove the theme and the settingCons: Well, it the game part of the game. Perhaps it is just me or my lack of affinity for this style of game, but it is boring.The open world is more a set of linear paths with pathfinding difficult as many gaps and places have invisble wall everywhereThe combat while fun enough feels more like fighting a cutting board. you are certain your going to win, but it just takes a while.It feels like a movie with an occasional audience partcipation.No explaination of the RPG elements are provided in the begining, it just assumed you figure it out.The mix of voice acting and no voice acting really bothers me, pick one.The first section was a misrepresentation of the game. It was much harder than later parts and a lot more intense and interesting.Overall: I like it but not enough to pay full price and not enough to recommend it if you got better things to do (some gamers only have time to play the best)			"

												First off before you dislike this review and hate on it I would like for you to read my opinon of the game...It's nothing about the story or anything like that I really am enjoying it A LOT and I will continue to play this game until i have  drunk it dry. However, the game has issues, one being a full screen bug that can be fixed and others being random freezes and crashes. They said that they focused on the PC port a lot to asure that the game will have a smooth launch, which it didn't. I even myself have encountered freezes and game crashes randomly caing me to lose progress on the story.So I would say to try your best to hold back on buying it and wait for an update.Also to add, http://www.game-debate.com/news/22524/nier-automata-pc-cut-scenes-capped-at-900p-30-fps-resolution-upscaling-bug-fixSo the PC Master race is behind on the Ps4 pro, I'm speakless, they advertised a 1080p experience, not some 900p 30fps... like are we on the xbox 1 or something? (♥♥♥♥♥♥ joke) I will update once it is updated to what they advertised to us.			"

												I... I just don't get why people like this.The combat is simplistic and too busy to be tactical. The open world looks grey and boring. The game loves ♥♥♥♥ing with your camera. The controls are hugely clumsy- what game requires you to be holding RB and LT for every single combat? The story throws a lot at you with the depth and tact of an 8 year old having seen Star Wars. The music is nice sometimes, but given how boring the combat was I preferred to just run a video in the background.And let me repeat this for good measure- designing a boss who I cannot lock onto doesn't make you smart, it makes you a jackass. Same for designing an ordinary enemy where I can only lock onto its invulnerable armor, and have to aim my gun manually to target its non-invulnerable legs.Just... don't buy this if you want Dark Souls. Buy this if you want something a bit more involved than super-cinematic games.			"

												WHAT THE HELL WITH THIS PIs- Port! **I want to play the game,  I have a GTX 1080.--  Can't run 1080p -no vsync without having a lag...With Vsync causes a 2 second lag.  2000ms Latency! ...WTF Why do I have any type of input lag/latency at all. Windowed and fullscreen can change this delaytime; however, it's never changed to an amount I would consider to be Negligable,  **What the hell with the dithering on the screen in fullscreen mode??   If you run in fullscreen, textures are dithered...like HEAVILY dithered (Dithering is a type of bluring w/ motion, it may not be dithering but the texturing isn't clear either way); however, windowed mode lets the textures come through Crystal clear?  how does that even happen?**No Vsync required with any other game; however, this game will cause MULTIPLE scan lines all over the screen that isn't related to sceen motion. I've waited...Like extra waited for this, because I wanted to see Automata on a 1080, at 4k.   The performance issues I'm having put me at the brink of returning the game and buying it for the PS4 just to avoid the amount of CRAP caused from this port.  I accept that 4k may not be doable, but 1080p, without latency, vsync, or performance issues should be more than doable.			"

												Story; 4/10Character likability: 4/10Gameplay: 6/10(when i intiially reviewed this - i had only done the initial playthrough and got ending A. Since have played through several more times, and still feel the same)The story is trite and boring. It's been done a million times before. Machines are bad. Humans (androids in this case) are good. The characater 2B goes from frigid ice queen, to caring mom mode - despite no character development taking place. The support 9S - is more like a ""follow mom to work day"" kid. Interactions with other characters in the game are boiled down to fetch quests, or protection quests. Having played as several different characters and got different endings - i'm forced to think that nobody in Square-Enix is capable of writing good game stories anymore. Additionally the multiple endings is a gimmick. tl;dr: woudln't recommend paying full price for it - wait until it's maybe €20/$20 or so in 3 months time. This is not going to be a classic game by any standards. Story is too short. Characters are boring. Each of the different gameplay modes are okay - but nothing special. Forcing players to play through again and again for some gimmick about multple endings is not good game writing.			"

												This is the first game I've ever refunded on Steam, and easily the weakest experience I can ever remember having with a game.The PC port is marred by all kinds of technical flaws. There are display errors, very annoying camera quirks, performance problems, horrible keybinds (some of which do not support remapping), and just all around a weird feeling to the control.I tried playing through the tutorial on the hardest difficulty, which was admittedly very tough. The largest obstacle to overcome was however the lackluster gameplay and extremely frustrating mechanics in the game's opening sequence. I ended up lowering difficulty, and still ended up just quitting the game, feeling that going through the motions of playing the tutorial isn't worth it to unlock a game made by the same team behind such a poor start. The game killed all of my interest in it, before showing a single glimpse of why it might be worth playing.The game starts off with some incredibly outdated space invaders and asteroids style gameplay. To go along with the forced retro minigames, you get some relatively bland music not contributing to the atmosphere, absolutely pointless little cutscenes, poor writing, obnoxious dialog, frustrating mechanics, and boring visuals.Let's go over the amazing cutscene design. After having control of the game for only seconds, you get treated to a cutscene of descending slightly in altitude, which is not shown in anyway to be a relevant maneuver. After getting under a minute more of time in control, you get to see your ship light up, indicating that you are now captain of the squad... that simply dies around you and served no real purpose in the game.The first impressions of the game's writing, just feels insultingly poor. You are immediately treated to seeing characters die around you, having shown absolutely no purpose of being in the story. Your squad members just give up one at a time, stand in the way of incoming fire, let out a scream, and get blown to bits. The squad members are even worse than characters made just for killing them off. The death of your squad doesn't really provide anything to the story. Aside from the completely unnecessary squad, the combat situations are handled in a horrid way. When you or your squad make a decision to do anything in mid combat, there is some type of completely unnecessary and ritualistic practice of asking for permission from HQ. You'd think a military operation had better planning ahead than a four year old. The voice acting early on in the game seemed like solid work, but the written dialogue did not do it justice. Over 90% of early speech is completely pointless.Apart from starting off with gameplay equivalent of a decades old arcade game, the game will throw a lot of very annoying mechanics at you. The camera in the game keeps switching to new points of view every 1 minute or so in the first 10 minutes. This is particularly problematic in a continuos sequence where the camera keeps twisting around, and it can forcefully move you to keep you in screen. You'll often be shoved through a wall of enemy projectiles. To top off the midgame camera angle changes, some of them will also leave you momentarily won't warn you about leaving you with inverted controls.The early visuals are pretty dreadful. Most of the early retro gameplay sequences look like something you might see in an asset flip, as does the first broader view of the environment. The first time you get to see where you're flying, you are greeted by an ocean filled with maybe a hundred sunken structures, consisting of two different structures copy pasted over and over. This incredibly low effort visual persists over 30 seconds of down time while just waiting to fly closer to your first mission.I've heard a lot of good things about the game past the tutorial, but I can't bring myself to play through such a poor tutorial. All I could think of during my time with the game, was how I'd rather be playing something else.			"

												The side-quests in this game are generally worse than the ones you find in MMORPGs. Constant back and forth running and boring, repetitive find-this-person and find-this-item, along with some particularly frustrating ones mixed in... And sudden, unexpected level jumps in quests that you only find out through trial and error since it doesn't actually tell the level of the quest when you accept it. The story so far hasn't really hooked me at all (Within 15 hours of play), and the only highlights are the boss battles. Combat mechanics are pretty dull and boring, and the different difficulty levels are pretty much a joke, changing little besides the damage you take. The only reason I continue to play this game is because I feel compelled by the 60€ I spent on it.			"

To the people going through these crashes, tough ♥♥♥♥, maybe buy a graphics card that doesn't need to be rolled back after every firmware update because it BSODs due to AMD not being able to release anything even close to their competitors.

												Nowhere in any of the videos or screenshots does it show that this game is primarily top-down/platformer/3D when fighting insanely huge robots.  It also has a arcade fighter-jet style combat intertwined as well.  This game is much more Armored Core and much less Japanese RPG.Not saying this is a bad game whatsoever...just definitely not my cup of tea, and nothing like what the screenshots/videos portray.  I expected more Final Fantasy and less Armored Core.Note: I went into this not knowing anything about the Nier franchise...and solely went off the screenshots/publisher's videos/game description.  I have been corrected that this is a ""typical"" Nier-style game...and that's awesome...just wasn't my cup of tea, and IMO, doesn't play like the advertised game.My complaint is with the marketing...not the game.

												The best part of this game by a long way is the Prologue. It's a brilliant high paced blending of different action arcade game genres, moving from one to the next beautifully. Honestly, that part of the game blew my mind.Then, the rest of the game happens. It's like someone else made the Prologue then went on holiday for a few weeks. Whilst he's away some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ has turned it into a plodding open world game that's at best an average RPG where you spend most of your time picking up items off the floor. And when it finally does go back into an arcadey mode it feels so out of place after the hours of trudging around. Sometimes it just doesn't seem to work or make sense at all and does nothing but hinder and confuse (boss at fairground for example).Certain things just don't make sense such as: Why is there fishing in this game? Wtf is the point in that? And why is the prologue so much more hardcore than the rest of the game? No saves (and you can be 1 hit by the double buzzsaws). This would be fine (oh, it's one of those hardcore games) BUT in the rest of the game you can save every 5 seconds! What's the point in the bodies everywhere? What are they even adding except to break the immersion? And what's the point in that idiot following me around the whole game like Tails?If the rest of the game was like the Prologue, this could very well be a classic game. As it is, it's just a missed opportunity.			"

Also WHY IN THE FLYING SPHAGHETTI are there black lines during the awesome cut scenes (30 fps) -_-..... WHY JUST WHY!This is SQUARE ENIX Im talking about. U make good CGI and sh*t but then when it came to this game u just BOOM ""Lets Put a limit to FPS and Increase graphics demand"" For NO particular reason. There could've been more graphic options to suit the low end PC gamers but this just breaks the 60 fps joy for them.Don't get me wrong I really love the game plot and the gameplay, BLAH BLAH... ANYHOW, IT IS a great game, IF ur conserned with your game preformance, better get a new gen graphics and a beast PC to keep that 60 fps in place. Go for it if ur a fan of hack and slash games with a hot steaming ♥♥♥ character. (get the achievemnt first if u know what i mean!)

												NieR:Automata was a game that started with a good impression, maintained a good impression throughout the first dozen or so hours, but then left a sour test after I had ""beaten"" the game. It is hard to write a review that addequately cnoveys my reason for disliking this game without spoiling how the game operates after your first play through. Let me start by saying the gameplay in Nier is fantastic. Once you figure out that upscalling is bad and you need a third party app (Borderless Gaming) to run the game without any hiccups, the game runs smoothly. I was playing the game on a 1070, i6700, 6 gigs system and never saw a slow down.The RPG systems are pretty complex as well. There are plenty of character building options for people to create their ideal play style. The sound design is equally impressive. The music score provides a variety of emotion; somber, upbeat, inspiring, etc.NieR: Automata would have been a fantastic game if they had just handled the method of story introduction better than the steaming pile of frustration the ending ends up being. It is hard to convey why this is such a big deal without spoilering things. For those that don't like treading the same ground more than once, avoid.			"

												Trust me when i say this is a 'cult-following' game only.      ~As someone who's beaten every single Dark Souls & Ninja Gaiden I know my way around a hack and slash.~      *This is my first Neir game and i had bought it on a whim with high hopes it wouldnt disspoint. If you're a die hard fan that is your agenda and you will not agree with what I'm about to say.*CONS:The voice acting is utterly disgusting and mono-tone.It swaps from voice dialouge to only being able to read certain dialouge. (its 2017 people there is no excuse for the lack of effort.)The open world reeeeaaaaaaaallly isnt even that open. They gave you the option to run and jump on buildings leaving the 'ground level' a virtual 'void' of uninteresting and unimmersive textures.The game does a HORRID job of convincing you that literally ANYONE in this universe gives a ♥♥♥♥ about anything going on.The enemies in the game aren't very detailed and for the most part, the mass of enemies are lack luster of anything remotely dipicting of a 'killer robot' ~They look like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off Wall-E from the pixar movie. PROS:The combat seems very refined and fluid, so if you're looking for an uninteresting and ♥♥♥♥♥ier Ninja Gaiden with an open world this is the game for you. 6/10 for its combat ONLY. If the combat had lacked literally anything else I would've given this a 3/10. This is a 'cult' following game because I feel the masses of people who enjoy this game are willing to overlook murder to say this is actually a great game. *******************************ABSOLUTELY DO NOT BUY BEFORE YOU SEE GAMEPLAY***********Stay skeptical and stop letting game designers spoon feed us garbage and get praise for it.

												LAZY port.This game has low CPU usage so I'm not bottlenecked by that, and yet I get huge frame drops into the 20's in 4K with a GTX 1080.By comparison I get a solid 60 FPS in RE7 and other graphically intense games give me FPS around 47-50 on 4K maxed out.This game has quite a bit of patching left to do. As of yet Nvidia has not released a driver updated with support for Nier so it is possible this is all just due to the lack of specific driver support.Wait until they fix the game or wait until Nvidia fixes their drivers.While I get about 45 FPS on average in Nier, the game ""chugs"" unlike it does on PS4 which is about 1 tenth the power of my PC.There are software layer issues either on Nvidia's side or the game's code.

												As of now, if you have a lower ended PC, I would not recommend this game. There are huge optimization issues, I have an Alienware x51 with 8GB of RAM, a Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-6400 CPU @2.70GHz, a 64 bit Operating System, and a Nvidia GTX 745 and I have to set the game's resolution all the way down to 800x600 just to get it to run at 30 frames. Developers of this game, I want to let you know that this is by no doubt an amazing game that I am glad that I have bought but I really want to see performance improvements. You need to make changes to optimize this game so people like me can play this. Once this is done, this review will be changed to a recommend but as for now, I can't recommend it to low and mid ended performance pc players. Please fix these problems so we can enjoy your amazing game.Sincerely, Miles Eremita			"

												People complaining about poor performance, crashes etc. must be having bad computers or bad drivers (AMD garbage). I'm running this game with all settings maxed at 1440p and it most often stays at 60 fps (which the game is locked to) but sometimes dips down towards 50 fps.My specs: i7 7700K @ 4,5Ghz, 32 (16x2) GB DDR4 @ 3200Mhz, GTX 1080The game looks really good and plays well. Feels very different from anything I've played before and it seamlessly switches between 3rd person, top-down and side-scrolling which works really well. Only played for 1 hour (haven't had a single issue or bug) but I can already tell that this will be an awesome experience.Update: After completing the prolgoue and getting to the open world, there actually seem to be severe draw distance issues with items ""LOD-ing"" just a few meters in front of you. Hopefully this will get fixed soon.			"

												Awful frustrating start to the game.  Instability issues plus console-like no save option make graphic glitches and crashing so much more annoying.  It's negative fun in it's current state.  If the developers are going to opt 1980s console mechanics and no way to save your progress in the first hour of gameplay they had better make sure it works.  It doesn’t.Technical Issues:LockupsPausesWhite screen of deathAwful fullscreen scalingGraphics tearing and corruptionI had to downgrade my RX480 drivers to get this game to run.Gameplay issues:No save in the first hour - such a draconian mechanic.Sad because there are some nice ideas and if I was able to save instead of having to repeat the start over and over there could be some fun to be had.  This is an insult to intelligence in it's current form.EDIT:I decided to run the game windowed and give it one more go.  I got to the point where the game actually starts and I must say, that I’m enjoying now.The game has a frustrating start and stability issues don’t help, hence my initially negative comments.  I would still suggest PC players wait for a fix.			"

												I'm now an hour in, its even worse than it was half an hour ago, crippling frame rate issues, even on lowest settings, I don't have a top of the line gaming rig, but its pretty substantial.  But its so bad its unplayable.  Plus you can clearly tell this was thrown togeather with zero polish.  The control assignments are still showing a PS4 controller.  I can't remap anything to keyboard shortcuts because I have no idea how that corresponds to a PS4 controller.  And they makle the game harder periodicly by switching to an overhead viewpoint that has the worlds worst camera and movement manipulation system.  Then they switch over to a side scrolling shooter beat em up that feels and looks like its from the 90's.  How on earth can you justify charging 60 bucks for this utter steaming pile of hot garbage.  Do not waste your money on this, its horrific, it feels like it is pulled out of a really bad arcade cabinet,  The publisher of this game should take their own life to try to restore some semblance of honor after puttign their name on somethign this bad.

												Argh... It's so close to being enjoyable.  The gameplay is this weird mishmash of bullet hell, macross (anime) and hack & slash.  And I just can't quite seem to enjoy it.  The thing that put me over the edge was the lack of a single save point from the start of the game to the first boss.  Like hell, why can't I save the game right before a boss fight at least?!?  And being ko'd multiple times from a single attack that I can't even dodge out of isn't fun.  At least potions are auto-use.I do give kudos to the devs for making something unique.  Just isn't quite my cup of tea I guess.			"

												Just not a very good game.  Combat consists of using a draone for low damage high rate of fire ranged attacks, and melee weapons for higher damage close range attacks, along with a special ""programs"" installed on the drone (longer cooldown high-damage range attack is what you start with, but there are other options).  First two bosses after the world opens up are either immune to melee attacks, or too dangerous to approach (And change patterns often enough that you can't really learn a pattern), making melee weapons feel pretty useless, and meaning you're stuck sniping the enemy with low damage attacks.  Game aggressively grabs control of camera and completely changes movement controls in the middle of boss fights.  Presumably to make dodging certain attacks easier, but it just makes movement more confusing (And once it switch to an overhead view, aiming because much more difficult, prolonging the new type of attack).Fighting normal robots is a bit more interesting, and the only thing I actually found fun in the game, though fighting is generally not great, and a number of attacks prevent you form moving, which further discourages close-in combat, since getting hit is pretty punishing.Item pickups come in a couple forms:  Swords/drones, which are really rare, in preset locations, random crafting stuff of unclear use (Can be used to upgrade weapons or drones, but placement and use seems completely random.  Also unclear what's useful and what's not.  Can I use moose meat to upgrade a drone?  No idea), upgrades for you to equip (You have a limited amount of space, and upgrades take up varying amounts of space - this seems like a reasonable mechanic, but never found it too useful.  It includes HUD elements, so if you like less HUD, you get more space), usable items (3 healing items, and things that temporarily boost attack / defense), money, and fish from fishing.  None of these are terribly interesting or rewarding - mostly you get random items (Is selling them a good idea?  Keeping them?  Seems completely random what's useful and what's not), and money, which does have some uses, at least early game, for increasing number of items that can be equipped, and buying and upgrading weapons (If you have enough of particular types of upgrade items, randomly strewn across the world.  Why am I finding ""silver ore"" in the middle of a destroyed city?).  There are also ""can't open this now"" crates, which is much less inspired than, say, areas you can't reach with your current abilities.  And given how boring walking around the game world is, I can't imagine ever going back to open any of these crates, unless you learn how to ride the many in-game moose to speed up movement or something (And why are there only moose?  I don't believe I've seen any other non-robots wandering about, other than birds and fish from fishing).The open-ish world is large enough that running from point to point consumes most of the game, but isn't terribly interesting.  Game has two completely different overhead maps, one on the map screen, which makes it completely unclear where you can go and where you can't, and a minimap, which isn't a whole lot better.  There's also a point where someone says they put a point of interest on your map where you can go back and get loot, but I could never find it on mine.  Save points are far enough apart to be annoying, and if you die against a boss, the boss gets healed and returns to its first state, you lose all the items you used fighting it on the first attempt, and have to pick up your corpse as well to get the programs you had installed when you died.  If you no longer have enough healing items to have a chance, tough.  Bosses also often hit you multiple times in a row, and while you're being hit, you (often) can't use healing items.  It's never clear when this is, so you just press escape to see a pause screen instead of the menu system from which you can use items.Also worth noting that ""open world"" isn't really accurate - run off the beaten path, and you're prettly likely to run into doors you can't currently open, elevators you can't currently ride, etc.Controls reek of ""Bad console port"".  ""m"" doesn't bring up the map screen, instead it does nothing, nor does tab.  The mouse works horribly for in game menus.  Sometimes you have a mouse cursor, sometimes it moves the focused from one atem to another (At breakneck speeds...) in the same menu.  When navigating menus, you often have to use ""escape"" to move up out of a submenu, even when both menus are visible onscreen at once - i.e., if there's a horizontal menu with vertical submenus, and you're in the vertical submenu, left/right do absolutely nothing, instead of moving between submenus, unless you escape out of the submenu, which is really kludgy and counter-intuitive.The writing is also bad - ""robotic lifeforms"" is a term used repeatedly, though it's also mentioned that they aren't actually intelligent (supposedly).   Another lovely piece of dialog is along te lines of ""Is that and android?  No, because it's actually a robot!"", which seems to rather fly in the face of the definition of android.There's also a system where when you die you leave a corpse for other players to find (And loot or revive to fight with them), and can set a message.  Unfortunately, the method for setting a message is clunky, involving multiple screens, and you can only mix and match hard-coded phrases, which isn't any fun.  If a moose kills me right at the start, surely I should be able to leave a silly message about my combat prowess!  Or if a weird naked white-haired guy kills me, shouldn't I be able to leave a message pondering if I was just killed by Sephiroth?  As-is, messages are just pointless.Invisible walls are also a core map design mechanic - it's never clear if you can jump up on something of a reasonable height, or if you'll run into an invisible wall.  I can live with invisble walls in a game where there isn't any platforming, but in one where jumping is a central mechanic for getting around, it's just painful, weird, and makes you waste your time trying to figure out where you can go and where you can't.  A decent mini-map could resolve that issue, but as mentioned earlier, the mini-map is not terribly helpful.I'm stunned this game is getting so many good reviews, particularly when so many amazing games have been released in the last few months.  If you want to run around a post-apocalyptic world killing robots, I'd suggest Horzon Zero Dawn instead.			"

												It's pretty, and the soundtrack is great. However, I asked for a refund after 45 minutes, and here's why:- This is not a RPG. It's a bullet hell. If you don't have good reflexes or spacial awareness, you're screwed, because...- The camera work is horrible. It's designed to be cinematic, but the changes in perspective make dodging a nighmare. And this is a huge problem, because...- No autosaves. Ok, why not - there are many excelent games with manual saves. Oh, what is this? No manual saves either? You die on a boss after 45 mins in the tutorial, and you have to restart the WHOLE GAME?This, in addition of the issues everybody else is talking about (full screen is broken, you have to use a third party software to unlock it), the price tag, and the terrible English voice acting, meant I asked for a refund.Many people love this game, including the friend who told me to buy it, but if the story, the graphics and the OST are the only things you find great about this game, just go watch replays on Youtube, you'll save 60€.

For short temepered people it will drive you insane- No save mode (in prologue). I had to put my game down multiple times, due to frustration. And every time, if you haven´t made it past the prologue you start all over again. This idea deserves an award for the worst ever to hit mankind- Price. 60 euros for this? 45 tops- Square Enix- 30 fps in cutscenes. It´s 2017, 30 fps was outlawed in 1989Maybe I´ll think of something later on to addCheers			"

												As a huge fan of Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, I was pretty disappointed by this Platinum title not for one reason, but a combination of different factors.-Poor optimization (Framerate dips to low 40s in some engagements, regardless of settings tweaks)-Boring enemies and simple combat. (Metal Gear Rising was also simple, but the parry system and health-steal techniques added a level of complexity and flair that made fights engaging.)-Forced shoot-em-up sections throughout each level. (I knew they were present but didn't know they were so frequent and mindless.)-Tonally inconsistent (this is a #Serious game, but the main characters wear a gothic lolita dress and small short pants to their military engagements? what??? at least bayonetta's design was consistent with the rest of the world + story)All in all, you might be a big fan regardless. If they ever fix the optimization issues, I would definitely suggest giving it a try yourself. However, I was surprised to find that I didn't have fun with this title, and wanted to share my experience.			"

												The game runs good for me.  The music is nice.  The character animations look really great.I think the combat is mess though.  I dislike the pod.  Are you supposed to shoot and melee the enemeies at the same time?  You technically can, but its super clumsy to do without lock on enabled.  Is there any reason why I would not want to be having the pod shooting in combat (even if he was missing the target)?  Many regular enemies in the game can be defeated by standing still and shooting the pod at them with occasional dodging, or just run past the enemies entirely.The game save system is not fun- manual saves at certain locations.  There are few automatic checkpoints.  To work around the crappy retry system in place, your best bet is to pack a lot of health potions to spam your way though a boss fight.  Dieing and replaying long sections, or easy mode spamming health potions as needed.  Neither outcome is fun for me.  This game does not make me want to get good at it.For me, the open world structure of the game causes the story to loose so much momentum that I stopped caring about it.  That is coming from someone who loves anime girls, sexy boots, swords and robots.It seems like I'm the only person who feels this way about the game.  I wish that I liked it, but it is not for me.

Probably not though.The game appears to be set in a post-apocalyptic world where the mascots for Google's ""Android"" OS have risen up to launch terrifyingly slow projectiles at you and throw themselves en masse onto your waiting sword. This is exactly as horrific as it sounds and raises questions of ""How did these daft creatures manage to overthrow humanity?"" and ""Is Google aware / complicit in it's mascot's machinations"" and ""When is this game going to let me save?""After smashing through a tonne or so of enemies with less effort than it takes for my step father to snort a line, I began to feel a nervous tension as i sensed the epic beating that usually follows such little effort. It was at this point that i Alt + Tabbed, and politely asked Google ""how the ♥♥♥♥ to i save in Nier: Automata""To which Google replied ""The wonderful weirdness of NieR: Automata - VideoGamer.com"" in which reviewer Adam Cook states ""Nier: Automata is a ♥♥♥♥ing weird video game.""Thanks Google...I soldier on, certain that a $60 game wouldn't send me 30 minutes into a game without a save point... It's at this point that i'm ambushed by to big digging... wheel... things... I don't know why digging wheels have this much articulation. It seems a little excessive for what i can only assume is a pretty straight forward operation. But i'm not a miner, so whatever. They beat me... and i'm presented with the title screen again. I hope and pray that the little info box that appears at the start of the game saying ""no auto saves in this game"" was just a little joke on the developers part...nope, restart the game... unskippable cut scene... same waves of suicidal mascots... I'm done. You lost me Nier.			"

												Would not recommend on PC, I started this game and on the first mission noticed i was getting 5-10 FPS the ENTIRE fighter plane starter mission, after an hour or trying to fix it i dropped my resolution to 1366 x 768 and my FPS went up to 30, so i figured that's bareable. once i left my fighter pilot to learn ground / melee combat, back to 5-10 FPS. i have an MSI GE62 Apache Pro Gaming Laptop and this game won't run. also throughout the missions there is constant texture glitches.

												Literally just started and I'm riddled with issues. Got immediate artifacting in the beginning sequence even though my GPU is at the default clock speed. I can't game capture with OBS so my twitch stream of the game is ruined. I get frame drops and crashes constantly. Like some other people said, it has resolution issues on televisions so I can't play in 1920x1080. Really considering refunding this game even though I've been hyped for so long. Keep in mind I'm on the latest drivers and they didn't fix any of the issues I mentioned.My specs are FX-8350 CPU. 8 gb of 1600 ddr3 ram, and RX480 8GB gpu.EDIT: I fixed OBS capturing by using a 3rd party borderless window program. This also allowed me to play in 1920x1080 resolution. All other issues still make the game unplayable.			"

												My advice is to know what you are getting going in, because i didn't This isn't the latest awesome hack and slash experience from platinum games. It's a story heavy, anime trope laced hybrid between RPG, SHMUP and hack and slash. So if you are here looking for soemthing like Bayonetta or Metal Gear Rising, I can't recommend this. I don't like the top down shmup sections, and theres alot of them, in no less than 3 or 4 variations, so its a big, important part of the game. The Visuals are generally very nice though. The hack and slash gameplay, the little i played of it seemed disappointingly basic because of the focus on the many other aspects of the game. I actually admire games with the courage to go the hybrid genre route, but i bought this game on Platinums reputation, which came with some perhaps unfair explactations, which just wanted to believe that it was a different game than it is. If you want a hack and slash, pass on it. If you want an interactive anime trope novel with a hybrid genre and gorgeous visuals, it may be for you. But for me, I found myself listening to paragraphs of cringy anime trope dialogue and entering another borign shmup section and i decided my money wasn't well spent.			"

												I finished the game. My save data was deleted. ""Thanks for playing""I can't beleive that's a feature of the game...Aside from that, the game's story itself is beyond bizzare in how it's told. I'm not sure exactly why they decided this, but this is the basics.Spoilers below---------------------TLDR; The game only gets good after ~13 hours. That's not fair or good game design. The 9S playthrough feels like work very quickly. A2 is the only good playable character. There is a great game hidden somewhere in here, but it never gets to see the light of day for long enough.The game is essentially split into 3 parts. The first part has you play out as the mascot of the game, 2B. This is all well and good, and the gameplay is pretty solid. The ending to this storyline however, is not. It happens about 8 hours in and tries so hard to be dramatic and sad. It just isn't. I barely care about these characters. On top of that, if they die they just have their memorys put into another android body exactly like the old one. The fact that you as the player constantly save means that dying means no loss of memory. But the ending to 2B's storyline tried to make it seem like neither character backed up their memories during the entire game... What? Poorly done and seemed super cheesy.Next up is you playing as 9S. This is fun at first as you now delve into the hacking portion of the game which is essentially a small bullet hell...well not hell, more like inconvienince. There are only around 10 truely unique hacking stages and since your best bet to defeat enemies is hacking, you'll burn through those 10 fast. Then it's all repeat. This is on top of the fact that you are playing almost an exact copy of the first playthorugh as far as the story is concerned. The only upside is that this is shorter; only about 4-5 hours or so. After this is where the game gets serious. I wish the entire game was as well executed as the last playthrough. If you stop playing after the first or second one, you haven't even really played the game. That's a huge problem. Why do I have to slog through 13 hours of gameplay to get to the actual good part of a game? It's like the rest was just a bad tutorial. So what's so good about the 3rd playthrough (yeah, there's 3...). Well, instead of focusing on a single character, the game swaps between 2; 9S and A2. 9S is the boring one of the two, but it's much better this time simply because you get a break from him when the story swaps to A2. Play an hour or two of one and swap to the other. A2 is also in general fun to play because you have some risk vs. reward in terms of dealing damage. The new berserk mode and taunting enemies helps to make combat a little more exciting considering how strong you are by this point in the game.The other huge improvement is the story. You see 9S break down slowly, and this time you actually understand why. A2 shows atleast a little character development, and the fact that she is fun to play as makes you actually care about the character that much more. Towards the end however, the story tries to tie up all the lose ends and honestly fails. The one good part about the 3rd playthroughs endings is the fact that you can opt to play a long and difficult bullet hell section where the credits attack you. Just when it starts to get tedious, the game throws a seemingly impossible section at you(It just so happens to start with the words ""Square Enix"" attacking) which then turns into a neat section where people who have also gotten this far all come together to help you finish it. But there is a catch.Do not make the same mistake I did. There is a cost to recieving help. Every. Single. Person. who helps you and you let die? That's someone's save files. All of them. Now some people probably made a backup because they played the other Nier game before this. I didn't.The game asks you if you would like to save someone. YesIt will cost you your save data. Yes, I have 3You worked so hard to get this far. YesYou won't get any thanks for it from that player. Yes, I'll just reload a little further backOk.The game then makes you watch as it deletes everything individually on the pause menu. Then as a huge ♥♥♥♥ you, it deletes all THREE save files LAST. I didn't think the game would do that, why would it? I said I would give up my save data to help someone, not delete everything ever. It's not that the game was unclear, just that I can't think of a reason why I would like that feature. Most people who do this just backup their data first, so what is the point of this feature? It only aims to frustrate people like me who got hit with the ultimate troll. Now there is a huge portion of the game's content that I'll never experience because I can't bring myself to play through the boring 13 hours that is the beginning of the game.What content did I miss? There are 5 'real' endings. I got all of those. There are also 21 other joke endings. Some are more obscure than others. I missed out on almost all of them. Also, if I want to play a little more as A2? Gotta play through ~13 hours of the game all over again.I do not recommend this game. There is far to much work expected of the player for far too little payoff in the end. The gameplay used in A2's arch should have been used throught the whole game. It would have made a huge difference in my opinion. I really, really wanted to like this game. There is a great game somewhere in there, but it's too few and far between.			"

												In its current state i cannot honestly recommend the game to anyone but harcore NieR fans. Future updates will probably fix the issues. PC port is really bad. Cutscenes run like dark souls blight town, hard capped at 30FPS, and for some reason while steam would report the cutscene is running at 30FPS the cutscene would infact play at very choppy FPS levels. sometimes going down as far as 9 visually. and for some reason isn't stretched to cover your monitor properly?However the game itself is very smooth. Runs and looks beautifully. I highly recommend playing with a Gamepad though. As in some sections in nigh impossible to do anything as dodging is doubletapping your WASD keys and in free flow your shooting is for some reason also bound to WASD as well as your mouse. If these issues are fixed in upcoming patches then i can switch my recommend to a positive but in its current state don't waste your money and sit on it.			"

												I got some hours playing and not finished the game. I'll try to make it simple and short for whoever will read this, with my pros and cons:+ Beautiful music+ Good playability and nice (and fast) combats+ Nice butt (XD)- No skill tree, so you lvl up and can't do a s**t with that, it just add status to your character- Locked at 60 fps and still horrible stuttering when moving around the map or in combat- The worst point is that after some hours of gameplay the game starts getting boring, repetitive, and with no skill tree I lose motivation for killing machines- Secondary missions are (again) repetitive and simple- Graphics are simply not good, there are tons of games with 5+ years old and they look much better, and the colors in this game are badSo, maybe it's a good game for people that's new in this kind of game or PC gaming (mainly for the fps cap and graphics, oh and the frame drops) but not for other people, especially when a game gets boring, because It is the opposite of what you are looking for in a game.Note that you can upgrade your weapons and add chips to your body, improving status and getting some abilities, but even then I feel like I was playing the same battles again and again. Just my point of view.			"

												The first third of the game is really fun, though gets really slow after the opera boss fight.The second third of the game is literally the first part but you play as a much less fun to play character.The third part of the game throws game balance out the window, everything dies in 2-3 hits and the bosses all suck and die almost immediately.The game had a lot of potential, but after the first playthrough it's just a bunch of copy pasted ♥♥♥♥ with awful fetch quests with almost no more unique boss battles.  Sad game.  Please stop giving it high praise.There is no point to switching up weapons because the default swords are amazing and give you a damage buff at full hp so pretty much just ignore the worse gimmick weapons.There is no party customization, the chip system is incredibly imbalanced and annoying to deal with.  Running low on money?  Well you better go fishing which is just you sitting by the water and hitting a button once every half minute.bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad WHY DO PEOPLE LIKE THIS GAME SO MUCH?!

												I was a big big fan of the original Nier. The world, the story, the characters and especially the music all stood out to me. The combat was lacklustre but it didn't matter but it made up for it with the rest. Here we have the opposite. I couldn't get further than the Beauvoir boss or whatever it was called before cracks started to show. The world is boring, not helped by the Playstation 2 graphics. The story hadn't started when i stopped, and that was a couple of hours into the game! The characters had were cardboard cutouts with nothing going for them. I'll admit, though, the music is still very good. Other than that, the difficulty is another point of hate for me. Easy and Normal are both exactly the same. They allow you to lock on (which saves you from using the TERRIBLE camera) and the game is so easy to beat it's laughable. On hard, however, you lose the lock on feature and most things kill you in one hit. On very hard, things kill you even harder. The rift between the two difficulties is huge and jarring to say the least. Finally, it's a crap port. It's locked to 60fps and 30 fps in Cutscenes. All the text boxes linger on the screen for too long after each sentences and, oh my god, the voice acting is dreadful. 2/10. Bad game. Saved from 1/10 by the music.			"

NieR: Automata is a linear action with bad controls, unbalanced difficulty and forgettable story. 1/3 of the game is mini-games (bullet hell). Achievements are a joke after you've completed the main story. Soundtrack and pre-rendered cut-scenes are excellent. Side quests are well-written, yet standard (mostly, ""go to A point and back"", ""destroy X enemies"", ""gather N items""), linear and involve a lot of backtracking. Two interesting bosses (Simone, the songstress, and Eve). Two relatively meaningful choices, leading to the same unsatisfying ending.			"

												Do not buy this crap. The game randomly crashes and there is no autosave system to make it bearable. I have played the beginning mission twice now only to have it crash, wasting 40 minutes of my time. Unfortunately, I bought this from greenman so I cannot ask for a refund. Platinum should not be allowed to release anymore PC ports. The past several have been utter garbage. The game barely even has any settings. Just resolution, AA, and anisotropic filtering. The game is beyond garbage, which is a shame,  because it has solid gameplay. The problem is that pervasive gamebreaking technical issues have made what could and should have be a classic to be a virtual paperweight. Check the game out later once Platinum actually gives a crap to fix this waste of time and money.			"

It renders the game at 720p when set to fullscreen.You can force borderless fullscreen with a third party program, but it leads to a long list of other issues including performance drops.Do NOT buy this until they fix these issues.

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAMEThis game is LITERALLY unplayable. The game keeps freezing randomly. There are many others that also face this issue. Just google ""Nier Automata white screen"". After some time the screen just randomly freeze, while the audio and game keeps running. If you wait, or alt tab out you will be faced with a white screen. Again, the game and audio is fine, and your input is still being registered. You just can't play the game anymore because your whole screen is white.This biggest issue with this is that you have no way of saving during the first 20minutes... I have tried so many things. Like changing control panel settings, updating drivers, running in windows 7 compatibility, disabling steam overlay, running fullscreen 1600x900 resolution. NOTHING WORKS.Specs:I7 870 ~2,90GhzGTX 7808GB RAMWindows 10I have been played this game for 90minutes now... and i still am not even on 20% of finishing the prologue / tutorial (i've played the PS4 demo so i know how long it takes. Its around 20minutes). That should give you an idea of how bad the freezing issue is.This game really is the definition of insanity.Playing the same 20min long tutorial, over and over again. Expecting things to change.			"

												It runs very badly on a 6700k / GTX 970. It's fairly obvious that it's a bad port because full-screening the game just makes a smaller, jittering, window on a black screen.

												TL;DR: Solid combat, a lot of cool ideas, not all executed well, with restrictive save system straight out of the 90s. Interesting game, but only play if you can invest a long chunk of time in the beginning.My first thoughts:Terrible controls and still no savepoint after 1h of playtime? If the game does not respect my time, it can go **** itself.So... Next day:I got the time to move past the first way too long section and give the gameplay after that a try. Super solid combat, after remapping all buttons to something sensible. Story seems pretty wacko, but that's what I was expecting.The save-system can still take a **** up its ***. I see what it wants to do. It wants to be Dark Souls. It wants to have bonfires. It wants you to lose your XP when you die, so that you must retrieve it from your corpse... yeah, Dark Souls. The problem with that: Dark Souls doesn't punish you with endless waiting, cutscenes and long travel times between tries at a specific enemy. You also don't have to win a terrible bullet-hell-shooter in-between tries.What this game needed was some guy that just sat down with the designers, drank a tea with them to calm their nerves, and asked them to f****** focus on a few mechanics and roll with them, instead of getting bored after having them 80% done and moving on to a new one! It makes for a crazy, but rather unpolished ride. Give it a try, if you are brave. But beware of the problems, cause there are many.			"

												The following is simply my opinion of the behaviour of the publisher of this game.I purchased this game on the 17th of March 2017 from my local games shop (EB Games Australia). This was the advertised release date, as given by my local retailer AND the official Square Enix online store for my region.I could not play this game on the 17th of March. The Steam frontend accepted the game key, pre-loaded the data, but would not allow me to launch the game.I contacted the retailer, EB Games head office, by telephone and requested that it be unlocked. I was promised a telephone call back that day, but I never received one.I contacted Square Enix support by email, and I received several rudely dismissive responses. Square Enix support openly admitted that the game did not unlock on the 17th March Australian time, as advertised on their website, and they accused me, stating that it was my fault for assuming that it would.The AUSTRALIAN retailer, EB Games, stated that the game would be available on 17th March 2017.The AUSTRALIAN online storefront for Square Enix clearly stated that the game will be available on 17th March 2017.I trusted that information applied to AUSTRALIAN time zones, and Square Enix told me that I was wrong to do so.By this point I was too frustrated and alienated by the behaviour of the retailer (EB Games) and the publisher's official support (Square Enix). I was also upset that I had been misled regarding the release date. I contacted EB Games and requested a refund, to which they -eventually- agreed.I cannot support a publisher that misleads customers, and then blames the customers for accepting their word.I cannot support a retailer that promises to look into a problem, but then fails to respond in a timely fashion.If someone sells me a product under false pretenses, I will demand a refund.If someone treats me like a fool because I accepted the content of their advertising, I will demand a refund.The game itself might be fantastic. I do not know, and I do not want to know. I have no intention of ever buying or playing this game again. I will not support companies that treat me in this manner, and I feel that it reflects badly enough upon the products they produce to merit a negative review.The experience around trying to simply access the game for which I had paid full retail price was, in my opinion, disgusting. As such, I am using this review as a warning.If you disagree with my reason behind this negative review, then please do go ahead and downvote me. Downvote me into oblivion if you want; I do not care. You are just as welcome to register your discontent over my review as I am to register my discontent over the product for which I paid. However, I feel that the principal of the matter still stands: lying and misleading in advertising is wrong.			"

												Terribly disapointed in the game !!! First of all and most important , it is not worth the 59,9 € i payd for since it have bugs, so unless they find some patch, i would like a refund.I lost 3 hours + of gameplay because apparently the game does not save !!i died on normal mode, so i tought owkey no problem, lets load the saved game & try again, so i did & i started right at the begining of the game (tutorial if you even can call it a tutorial). Realised the game did not saved & i lost my proress!The second thing i realy don't like is the camera, since we buy the game, you should not restrict the cammera!! If you look up, the camera goes next to your char, so you can not look very well since the thing is moving side ways ...that sux big time and for the ppl who are trying to idk enjoy the other kind of view, don't be mistaken, you wouldn't see nothing anyway ... it's been restricted by some idiot animation that prevent it. it's dumb because it's 18+.whats also hard is trying to shoot while you slash ... cause your robot share the camera you use ?? thats dumb to.Should have given the player a pair of guns instead.So i don't know if there is any fixes to these specific things but if not, i'd recommend not to buy that game.It's realy not worth it for what most ppl think it will be.i also have the fullscreen bug...that being all said, i hope you guys fix all of these problems.Thx.

												Let's start with the one positive thing I can cite without exception.MusicThe music in this game is absolutely incredible.  The soundtrack is amazing.  It's catchy, memorable, and suitably atmospheric.  Great stuff worth listening to, even outside of the game.Now on to everything else... Starting with the controls.ControlsJust plug in a controller.  The KB+M input is absolutely terrible - spamming dodge becomes more and more required as the game advances, and double-tapping a movement key to dodge becomes impractical when you need to jam out 2 dodges a second to avoid chain attacks.  Seriously, use a controller.There's a significant amount of ranged combat in the game (especially the final boss), which is a huge pain for me.  I can't aim ranged weapons with sticks in a 3d environment (I use KBM for my shooters), so I had to endure most of the game using melee only.  The final boss can only be damaged by ranged attacks, so I can't fairly determine how hard that boss is supposed to be.  Suffice to say, it was INCREDIBLY difficult for me because I just couldn't aim well enough to him.  (which is particularly hard given that fight occurs in a sandstorm)The IntroductionThe introduction begins with an 80's style top-down Shoot 'Em Up ala Gradius or Life Force, only far far simpler and way easier.  The sequence is roughly 20 minutes long, full of cutscenes, and completely unskippable.  Shortly after this schmup sequence is completed, you're set into the game's actual combat system and allowed to practice against a handful of easily defeatable dummy robots.After nailing the dummy bots, you'll be toss up against the game's first boss.  Most of his attacks will kill you in just 2-3 hits on Normal, but there's an auto-healing ability built-in to your character at the start that uses your healing items automatically when you become critically damaged.Unfortunately, this boss also has a wonderful move that is impossible to dodge without spamming the dodge button to chain ""perfect dodges"" in a row.  Should the attack hit you, you will instantly die and be sent back to the title screen.  And have to play the entire schmup sequence all over again. Even after beating this boss, you've still got another 30 minutes and one more boss fight (that thankfully, can't instantly kill you this time around) before you're finally allowed to save.  (On that note, if you have Microsoft OneDrive, disable it, the game will lie to you and say it saved successfully, but OneDrive actually blocked it with read-only permissions!)General GameplayThere's an ""open world"" aspect to the game, complete with side-quests.  Unfortunately, the world isn't that large or ""open"".  You're generally on rails heading into each area.  Then ""open world"" serves a time waster as you traverse back and forth across the same terrain fighting the same enemies over and over again.  You'll eventually get to a point where you just run past the enemies because you're sick of fighting the same thing over and over.The CombatThis is where the game really, really falls apart.  There's a lot of problems - let's break them down, one by one.1. The Camera: This thing is your WORST ENEMY.  It's slow, it doesn't automatically rotate to keep enemies (even bosses) in view, requiring you to manually pan the thing around to see what you're looking at.  Even using the built in ""quick turn"" feature, it'll take a couple of seconds to drunkely steer itself 180 degrees behind you so you can see what's currently trying to have its way with your ♥♥♥.  It's like the camera is a physical entity in the world, and not nearly responsive enough for such a fast paced game.2. Damage Scaling: After the introduction, the combat isn't so bad.  You get a feel for your weapons and can start taking risks to learn your limitations now that death doesn't mean replaying the introduction all over again.Unfortunately, by the last third of the game (last 2 hours, it's roughly 6 hours long), enemies start gaining massive amounts of HP and attack.  Common enemies will wipe you out in three hits, bosses in two.  Literally the final bosses have +500,000 HP and you're still dealing only 63 + 24 damage per light attack, as high as 90 + 19 for heavy attacks, and only 6 damage per ""pew pew"" pellet from your little robot buddy.  It turns every single boss into a ridiculous endurance marathon.  I clocked the 3rd to last boss - it took me 23 minutes to kill.  Also, the game crashed right after that, requiring me to fight it again.  (Granted, that's the ONLY time the game ever crashed on me, at least)The StoryUp front, I didn't care for a story going in.  I like my action, a good story is just a bonus.After completeing the game, I can say the story itself is nothing special.  The characters are all predictable and one dimensional - and that's okay.  I liked Metal Gear Rising: Revengence's characters, despite having the same qualities.  However, MGR was ""self-aware"" that it was an over-the-top spectacle fighter and played with the tropes for fun.Nier seems to take itself way, way too seriously.  Overwrought, overly dramatic, and serious to a fault.  That said, the work that went into presenting the story is exceptional.  This is some top-notch presentation here.  Unfortunately, it's in service of something that takes itself too seroiusly and aspires to be much more than it actually is.VerdictDo not buy.  The combat becomes a dull chore near the end, the camera is constantly fighting you, and the story isn't worth suffering through the gameplay for.  This is strictly an ""average"" game with a large budget, a big name, and a popular studio behind it.  Ultimately, had anyone else been responsible for creating it, it wouldn't be yielding the high praise that it currently is.			"

												First and foremost, here's one huge CON.You need to know that they couldn't decide what kind of game they wanted to make so they made 3-4 types of games in 1. RPG/side scrolling Platformer/Spaceship style shooter/Gauntlet style hacker. The game constantly changes from a perfect 3rd person RPG hack and slash with a shooter option to a side scrolling platformer and them the camera will zoom way up overhead so you are now playing a sort of Gauntlet style game where jumping to avoid enemies becomes pointless due to the overhead angle. It also will have you flying, taking on enemies from every angle so you have to now deal with aiming one way while you run another which is just plain stupid.If you notice the trailers and gameplay they released, it NEVER shows this. Because they know they wouldn't sell the game.The Game is made well and I had no crashes so I won't be asking for a refund because I'm not some infant that demands a refund because I don't like the game. There is NO save sytem for you to save when you feel like it. You can only save between missions.There is a distinct lack of color in the game. It's white-washed and bland.When I first started playing, the game was so SLOOOOOOOW. It had serious lag/framerate issues that got better and worse depending on the amount of enemies there were on the screen. Or if I got near lava/molten metal, the game got amazingly slow. Like some graphics caused it to have to work harder just to run.The ""map"" is a joke for the most part. Like I said, I won't be demanding a refund but I definately don't recomend the game.			"

												Alright, just so the rabid fanboy's of this game/company can't say I never gave the game a fair chance, I've got nearly 10 hours on record, I've sacrificed my Steam refund eligibility for this game, all for the sake of trying to crack it and see why anybody actually likes this game, here's what I've found;Pros:- Decent graphics- Hold 'B', kinda the only real selling point of this gameCons:- Drops you into the story head-first with no explaination whatsoever- Boring/Spammy combat (Find enemy, press 'Attack', rinse, repeat. Nothing special)- Enemies are tanky for no reason other than to have the illusion of difficulty- Weak/Predictable story, with as far as I've gotten in my 10 hours playtime, everything was bland, boring, predictable, uninspired... you get the point, again, 'Nothing special'- Lacklustre world design, big empty buildings, samey structures, scenery and architecture- No auto-save, not even at very important parts of the game (I don't care if that's ""How it's supposed to be"", it's a poor design choice, and I think they should've decided that maybe that's not how it should be.- Terrible camera direction (Don't give me that ""Oh it's 'expermiental'""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, if it doesn't work, don't do it. I don't need the game changing from Bullet Hell to Sidescrolling platformer to Third-person over-the-shoulder, to Top-down or whatever, pick one, and stick with it, it's a lot less nauseating and annoying.- Random rogue-like elements tossed in for 'flavor' (Much as with the previous point, if it doesn't work, don't do it. This mechanic doesn't add anything to the game, it just adds another chore. Doesn't make fights any more perilous, it only makes dying that much more frustrating, and for no reason other than to try and perpetuate the illusion of difficulty that this game seems deperate to try and fabricate.)So, all in all I would say this game was a flop. Of course the fanboys don't see it that way, because Daddy Platinum can do no wrong. Nothing against the other games Platinum has made, I haven't played a lot of them, I have no clue if they're good or bad, but maybe that's why I'm not heads-over-heels for this game, because I don't believe in giving games a pass based off the merits of games previously developed by the company. Looking at this game individually and judging it by it's own merits though, It's a hot-mess that I can't believe Square Enix signed off on.At last, as if my recommendation wasn't enough, this game is simply nothing special or amazing. Why anybody would openly defend this game wholeheartedly is beyond me. I mean, I get it if you're just in love with 2B's thighs, I get it, but just be honest about it and don't try to pretend like your love for the game is anything more than that. At best this game is eye-candy with a touch of frustration, boredom and the corpse of a better story just decaying somewhere deep inside with just enough 'action' to keep you firmly planted at the back of your seat. Y'know, maybe the game is worth 'something', but it sure as ♥♥♥♥ ain't worth $60 I'll tell you that.Now come crucify me fanboys, not like you haven't already.If you need a second opinion that's prehaps phrased better or more eloquently, just watch this; http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/117019-Nier-Automata-Review "

When it first came out I thought the game was slow but turns out, my computer that should be able to run this game cant. I refunded the game already and i just hope that it is fixed.			"

												It's a consoleport junk, best to stay away from it. Doesn't have any config on the mouse at all, just a simple keyboard mapping change which is pretty much set up in a way that it expects you to use 2-handed keyboard setup..?????!! what is this 1990? It's a damn joke. The mouse has a few pre-set bindings which are clearly missing even the most basic stuff like...SHOOTING. Sensitivity is obviously cannot be changed since no config. If I want to play a junk controller then I'll buy a console....but I'll never ever do that so f*ck these cheap consoleports that only aim to pull some money off the PC community as well without putting even a mediocre effort into making it playable.

												From the mind of Game Director, Yoko Ono (creator of the original Nier and Alpine Racer 2) comes Nier: Automata. A brutally boring, beat-em-up brawler. Not only is this game his most uninspired work yet, the level of difficulty of this game will turn off any casual gamer.Cons: -Story leaves a lot to be desired.-Game controls very poorly on a joystick.-Battle system is way too hard, even on beginner difficulty.-Robots look unrealistic.-Open world leads to confusion quite often.-Weird buzzing at all times? (something with AI whirligig that rotates around the character?)-Why would an advanced AI from the future use a sword? Dumb.-VR support is very limited-References to Nanking Massacre being made up(???)Pros:+Framerate runs at a smooth 30 FPS even on the lowly GTX 1070+Great sound effects+Transgender Protagonist All in all: not much good, lotta bad. Give this one a hard pass.

												Played for about an hour. No savegames allowed and no hints when to expect them. Got killed by two buzz saws. No hints on how properly fight/dodge them. Game over, start from the very beginning. Applied for refund immediately.In general, poor, repetitive hack'n'slash gameplay. Erratic, unpredictable character control. Good-for-nothing tutorial. Unclear, unexplained idea of health, which spontaineously recovers for no apparent reason. Flickering UI panels, that disappear so fast, that you cannot read what it says. Din't see any promise for a sensible story either - a couple of meaningless dialogues in an hour of gameplay. You probably have to be true JRPG fan to enjoy playing that.			"

												Where to start first I don't like Anime I don't like the art style of this game I don't like the combat nor like the goofy and sparse enemies I can't get myself into the story because I simply can't stand anime also the games console port is terrible There is a problem with any resolution above 900p and this can't be fixed with borderless windowed or windowed mode. The game seems to be optimized around this resolution, hence why some shader effects look totally ♥♥♥♥ed up and really low quality at higher resolutions. It's not that bad at 1080p, but it gets worse the higher you go the game also peaks my GTX 1080 at 1440p I mean I didn't drop below the 60FPS even with MSAAx4 which apparently doesn't even work on this game is just there to drain resources the amount of graphical power needed to play a title that looks this bad is absurd also the draw distance is really short there is no improvements here over the PS4 version is just a mess of a port			"

												Sorry, it seemed kind of fun to play and very charismatic. But I died fooling around on the first boss just to see what I could and couldn't get away with, and whether there were weaknesses I should be going for or just dodging. And so I got sent back to the start of the game to repeat the easy section that had just taken me half an hour.You can say git gud all you like, but part of gitting gud is being able to figure out what works and what doesn't. ""Hard"" games make you git gud enough to get past a roadblock, but they generally don't throw huge time sinks in the way for failure. That's not fun, and it doesn't make me git guder any faster. I'm not paying $60 to have my time wasted because I tried to learn how to play the game. That shows no respect for the player. It was fun though, so I'll be back when it's less than $20 and I don't feel like I'm paying a premium to have the developer giggle at how they made me repeatedly trudge through stuff that wasn't challenging just so that I could have another shot at the hard bit.TLDR: Good game, bad design philosophy for anyone who doesn't look up on the internet how to beat fights before going in. Or isn't a gaming god with tens of hours to spend each day playing.			"

												So, after playing for only 1.7 hours of Nier Automata, I feel like I can give a proper review of the game. While the action feels fun, the music so far is pretty good, and I like some aspects of the art style…….I’m afraid this game has a huge problem which I cannot overlook. As a staunch feminist, I’m afraid to say that this game is too sexist for me to play. The character of 2B is too sexualized, you can even see her undergarments. Its hard to believe that still in this day and age game developers are designing characters that are purposefully made to catch the male gaze. It must be because Japan has yet to experience the culturally enriching influence of thousand/hundreds of thousands of muslim immigrants in their country. Otherwise they would have know that the better option for 2B’s character instead of that skimpy outfit of the patriarchy she wears in the game, would have been a burka. While I’m sure the gameplay mechanics of this game are fun, I can’t help but give it a 1/10 for pandering to the cis hetro normative patriarchal gamers, and not having enough diversity and less sexualization in the game.

												I cant recommend this game. Its just agonising to play honestly. I run overwatch on high quality with the highest resolution and it runs perfectly, with this game I'm running it on low with the resolution set to the lowest I've seen since like 2004 and i can barely tolerate the framerate. If i try to run at any higher quality the game goes into super slow motion and is unplayable. The save function is a crime against humanity I played through the whole of the first level with the graphics looking like complete ♥♥♥ only to die to the the boss and i have to play the whole game again, like an hour of gameplay which considering it was difficult to enjoy the first time round im not playing through again im just not a masochist. Seriously why cant the save function work like literally every other game, or at least spawn me to before the boss fight but dont take the ♥♥♥♥. If i wanted to play a roguelike I'd play a roguelike, If i wanted to contemplate suicide I'd give this game another go.Edit: I wanted this review to highlight my issues with the fps and the save function but on another note whenever you take damage beyond a certain point the game does that thing where you go into slow motion and your character gets knocked over and considering the bosses are giant machines which take up the whole map and just ram themselves into you, this happens alot. Please anyone who is making a game dont put this in, its so jarring a piece of me dies everytime. and considering the bosses are giant machines which take up the whole map and ram themselves into you, this happens alotEdit: Specs CPU - i7-6700.

												(POST - PLAYTHROUGH EDIT) This is, hands down, one of the greatest games I've ever played in my life. Buy this game.This is a good game because I bought it. Tastes fine. Smell alright. Very large graphics. Would not reccomend to the age of anyone. Purchase this game.FirstHere's my actual review.First off, let's talk about the port. It's not nearly as bad as the plethora of negative reviews would lead you to believe. Actually, it's probably one of the better ports out there. The framerate has yet to give me any problems, it glides through the game in smooth 60 fps. (Cutscenes are a whole different story, though.) The controls work fine as well. I feel like this shouldn't have to be said, but if you plan on enjoying many of the games that you have at your disposal on PC, you need to buy a controller, and there's no getting around it. The keyboard and mouse, while versatile, is not the ideal method of playstyle for many of these games, so drop the ""I didn't buy this game to buy a controller"" BS, splurge a little, and buy yourself an Afterglow 360 controller for $18. I'm sure that if you have a computer that can play games like these, you can at least afford something like that without going hungry. Now, on to the game itself.Now, I'm a fan of Squeenix and Platinum games, but I had no knowledge of their collaboration with Yoko Taro on this game until recently. I was a bit wary of this title, considering the first Nier received less than favorable reviews, and that this game had only been conceived as a result of the cult following it accumulated, but ultimately, I'm glad I took the dive and purchased this game.I have had no experience with the previous Nier games, but I'm told that it had a tendency to mix up the genres on the fly, much to the dismay of many people playing the game. Obviously, the gameplay wasn't great. You can see that just from watching playthroughs of the game on youtube, and the story was what brought it so much attenton. However, here, these changes feel smooth and crisp. In only the first level, you're playing a bullet hell, a rail shooter, a brawler, a twin stick shooter, and even gameplay resembling that of Strider, and it all works well. Nothing feels sloppy, and it's almost as if you're going through a series of smaller, snappy minigames in between the main focus of the game, the hacking and slashing. All of your movements in combat feel appropriate, and every time I've taken damage in combat, I've always been able to clearly define my mistake and understand what I did to deserve the punishment that was delivered in response. The combat is polished, satisfying, and fun, which is all I ask for in my games.One thing that really surprised me when picking up this game was the detail in the combat animations in particular. Part of what helps the game not feel as slippery as some other hack n slashers is the fact that every movement feels like it has significant weight to it. If you ever get the chance, just watch 2B make a single action from one button press and observe every element of her movement. Heavy attacks look just as heavy as they should be, with particle effects and sound queues appropriately matching the action shown, followed by a slow recovery (That can be cancelled with another attack or a dodge, mind you.) That makes sense, considering the impact of the movement. Light attacks, as you'd expect, are a lot more floaty. Swift attacks and sharper sound queues are brief and crisp enough so you can easily tell what kind of damage is being done and what kind of action was just made.I will not say anything about the story.With this all being said, do I reccomend this game? Yeah. It really does feel like a game that ""has something for everyone"", and I've been enjoying myself so far. Check your specs to make sure you can run it well enough, and avoid looking at any review that starts with ""The port"". You're less likely to receive the information you came here for, which is obviously, ""Is this game any good, and should I buy it?""And to that question, I answer yes.			"

												I was so excited when I heard this was making its way to PC and I haven't been disappointed one bit.The intro was phenomenal and full of intense action, a great introduction on what to expect throughout the game with all the different gameplay perspectives you experience.The soundtrack is legit some of the best composed fantasy music I've heard in a long time, very very good.Combat isn't too difficult, things may *seem* chaotic at times and shifty camera angles don't help in those situations, but its all intentional and part of the experience that keeps you on edge during intense action.Story is interesting albeit somewhat morbid it kicks off fairly quickly.Highly recommend this game.

The way this game has a classic game feel, that is challanging but in a good way. The transition from open world, to side scroll, to top view is flawless and it works. The music really pulls you into the game too. Controlls are flawless and smotth. Now yes there is a 60 FPS cap but there is NOT a resolution cap. Been running @ 4k DSR no problem. If you are on the fence about this game then I would suggest you get it. So much more to it then you think.			"

												Can't say anything bad about the game in all honesty. I find the game incredibly beautiful, along with absolutely fantastic music. The world feels mostly big enough, it's not excessively big, but big enough that I can go exploring a bit. I only had one crash - and that was very early in the game, and I've not encountered anything too buggy or what have you, at least yet. Not going to type out a big long review, but if you like fast paced combat, beautiful music and scenery and massive bosses, it's great. And Kudos for the controls on keyboard/mouse feeling excellent (to me) and I love how the game can transition from 3rd person to platformer, to top-down seamlessly at times. No regrets so far.			"

												After 5 hours I already feel like I have gotten my moneys worth and I've only just started.  I don't really write reviews but this game hit a bunch of boxes for me.- The combat is very remenicent of DMC or Beyonetta but so far I am liking it much more. It feels very fluid and responsive and you have lots of ways to change it up even at the start.- The graphics are beautiful, it runs really well on my 1070 which I understand is a higher end card but my set up is only about $1400 CDN so nothing special. I love the visuals and the character animations while fighting- The story so far has me sucked in, I love the world and characters and their dialogue is great so far. I wish every single line from every one off NPC was voice acted but I'm going to be reading everything and talking to everyone.I will update this review if I feel there is more to add but right now I don't see how this could turn into a negative review.

												This is a true master piece! The world feels alive, great dialogue and graphics are phenomenal.The weapons are fun to use, lots of combos to pull off. Different levels of challenge if you so choose so. Voiced in Japanese and English. Accompanied by 9S (which is a pleasure to listen to his dialogue)throughout your adventures along with the pods. Game seems very well optimized for the PC, I do get some low frames during very populated bot areas and during certain cut-scenes, but for the most part I'm pleased with the frame rates. The way the game forces the camera into top down, side view(shoot-'em up arcade game) is a welcoming fresh experience in a fully 3rd person RPG.  Not to mention the use of the pod being your personal infinite projectile shooter is awesome! Including the fact that 2B(your character) has no limit/stamina so you can potentially sprint/dodge for as long as you want.It's easy to see that the developers had alot of fun creating this game and pulled out all the stops to make this game a 10/10. Best to give this game a shot, I'm very content with this purchase.I can see myself completing this game.			"

The only other issue were occassional frame drops, but this rarely ever happened.This was definitely worth $60.			"

												Game was literally running in slow-motion. Not low framerate, actual slow motion. I tolerated this until it got past the tutorial area and where I could finally save. Then I went to bed.Then I woke up and tried playing it again. It would not open. The game would not start. At all. I restarted my laptop, I upgraded my drivers, I tried the Borderless Fullscreen fix, I tried the resolution fix. Nothing worked.I refunded the game.This is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. This is an intolerably, unacceptably bad port.			"

												I hate hack-and-slash games but I've just spent 10 hours playing this game in the last couple days and can't seem to be losing inerest. Soundtrack is great, combat is fantastic and by Zeus almighty - ""Romeos and Juliets"" got me laughing so hard that I almost fell off my chair. The only negatives so far is that the world is still quite empty, map function implementation sucks and 2B is wearing a onsie under her dress. Seriously? A onsie? I demand lingerie patch immediately!			"

												What can you really say?Japanese perfection, the music graphics story and action grabs you instantly. You can feel this game was made with passion and not money as the main incentive. I have only played the prolouge  and i know this is going to be one hell of a ride, i can feel it in my gaming bones.Platinum games have done it again.Works perfectly fine at 3440x1440 fullscreen.

												I rarely buy games on launch day but after seeing the glowing reviews on PS4 and there was also a discount running on Green Man Gaming I figured why not? TLDR is that it's a fun game but as a PC port it is SO-SO. Pros - Fun  and varied gameplay, cool art direction, English and Japanese VO, sexy charactersCons - Full screen 1080p doesn't work for me, XBone controller didn't work first few times then magically worked after restarting the game a few times. Gameplay runs smooth but cutscenes are capped at a lower framerate. Camera can get funky sometimes. Screen tearing even with vsync on. Game is capped at 60 but that's no biggie for me. WTF - Can't save the game until you get past the prologue. Some gameply settings are unavailable until you start a game. You would think that the prologue would be the part that has any tutorials but those come after you get past the prologue.  "

												Like many other I had to deal with the fullscreen bug, but once I worked around that I was able to enjoy this game without any other issues. Gameplay is great the shifts in perspective, from 3d to 2d sidescroller and 2d overhead at first are pretty neat, right now my only issue with the game is the cutscenes being locked at 30 and it being jittery if CS were at 60 hell even 45 with the gameplay itself locked at 60 i wouldnt mind it allAs for that fullscreen bug the fix depends on what type of gpu you have I have a rx480 so my fix was to roll back to pre relive drivers which are 16.11.5 and I also play in windowed mode but theres a 3rd party program called borderless gaming that i use to play 1920x1080 borderless and it runs great. Yes it sucks to have use that as a work around but at least there is a work around and the hope of a patch to fix up the issue offically.			"

												Pretty terrible if you use a keyboard.  Since lock on can't be bound to any mouse buttons, you're stuck awkwardly moving your finger back and forth from one of your movement keys to hold down lock on.  Aiming is also a bit finicky, but you should pick up a controller and enjoy this game.  Gameplay is amazing, and it feels very smooth.  This game is not for the faint of heart.  You cannot just save this game any time you want.  There are specifics locations you can do it, which is a key feature of the game.  So SAVE OFTEN.  It will be a very challenging game.  It took me about 2 hours before I could even reach the first save point, but it did take me a bit to get used to the controls.  I would recommend buying this game if you like a challenge, but playing with keyboard and mouse right now is pretty much impossible.			"

												This game has no business being as good as it is. On paper, it's the most derivative, overwrought game imaginable. Hot anime babes in EGL gear with swords killing robots. Yet it manages to be fantastic by virtue of its apparent self-awareness, deft directorial style, and eclectic gameplay. So while being a closet weeb (like me) might help you appreciate it, it's not at all pre-requisite.I should mention that the self-awareness I'm talking about doesn't manifest in an over-the-top, breaking the fourth wall, winking to the camera kind of way. This game isn't impressed with its own cleverness the way some other games and anime are. Rather, it's fully sublimated into the gameplay and story with nice little touches you might not even notice at first. There are countless references to other games, genres of games... and some of these references are a bit oblique, so only aficionados of RPGs, Shmups, etc. might appreciate them. However, despite all the in-jokes and the frenetic pace at which gameplay styles change, the game manages to be really accessible. NieR: Automata isn't a really hard shmup, or a really hard action rpg, or a really hard platformer. The difficulty arises from the need to change between these different ways of thinking, sometimes at a breakneck pace. And yet the experience manages to be totally cohesive and intuitive. This might be disappointing for some people looking for a brutally punishing action rpg experience, but for those who want a JRPG that moves at a nice pace and isn't grindy, it's wonderful.I can't speak to the overall quality/pacing of the story, as I'm only 4 hours in, but so far it's managed to be curiously compelling.Technical details regarding the port:Everything except the cutscenes is very smooth for me on high settings, even with AA, Blur, etc. The cutscenes drop considerably in framerate, frequently below 30—even though they don't actually look any different. So I imagine this is because there's background loading happening while the cutscenes are playing? It's not the biggest problem because the cutscenes are mostly very short, but I still really hope they fix this in a patch.My setup: Windows 10Intel i7 4790 GTX 1070 8gb16gb Ram			"

												I never played the first NieR but randomly saw this game on Steam 1 month ago and it looked good. Picked it up on day 1 and WOW.  This is the best game I've played in a very, very, VERY long time. It's been a while since I actually cared about characters and cared about the story being presented to me. I'm on my 3rd playthrough and my mind continues to be blown! I highly recommend this game to anyone considering it. The OST is also amazing!!!! There are a couple issues on PC (fullscreen issues, locked at 60fps, white box issue etc) but they hardly detract from the game (at least on my system it's been running wonderfully). Devs are aware of the problems and fixing it. This game is worth your money. I promise that!			"

												Before buying it, you may want to know something about the gameplay.First, despite of the tag you see, this game is not really hack and slash. The gameplay will change greatly after you done the first playthrough and become 2D shooting game most of the time.Second, this game is easy by default. To the point that you can consider it as visual novel if you don't try difficulty higher than normal. If you look for a challenge, go challenge yourselves without utilities that are given.The main pro of this game are story and soundtrack. After really finish it (not just the first or second playthrough) , you may found yourselves bought a visual novel not an action game.			"

												So far seems very good, a final fantasy type of RPG with regularly changing combat modes from top down shooter to 'Devil May Cry-esque' to 'Einhander' & 'Starfox'The Good:  Playing for about an hour and a half now, and I've played ""bullet-hell"" style shooting sequences alongside a well put together 3rd-person beat-em-up sequences, the changing perspectives and styles flow pretty well and keep things interesting.  Gameplay looks great at solid 60fps 2K with a GTX 1070, and I'm looking forward to dumping alot of time into this game! The not-so-good:  Many cutscenes stutter pretty badly and cut the framerate to 30fps.  I would prefer unlocked framerates, and some of the nice scenic cutscenes that do play at 60fps are hampered by transluscent black bars at the top and bottom of the screen...I also think the 3rd person 'DMC' mode could pull the camera out a bit, it makes for a kind of claustrophobic battle in some areas, though when the view pulls out for side-scroller and flight I think it's perfect.   Recommend!			"

												There are some definite technical issues that pretty much every other review has discussed, but with my i7 6700k, 970, and 16gigabutts of RAM I'm able to run the game at 60FPS with most of the gwafix options at second highest, shadows at medium, and motion blur off (it makes me sick, no idea if it actually effects performance since I keep it off). The fullscreen 1920x1080 bug sucks, but I didn't really notice it until going into the Steam overlay and there's a borderless windowed program you can use that makes it properly run at 1920x1080.Now as for the game, I went in with my expectations fairly low since I really didn't care for the demo when I tried it on PS4. Maybe it's because I'm now two feet from the screen instead of an entire room lengths away so now I can see everything a lot better, but it was a lot more enjoyable now than it was before. The bullet-hell segments are really fun and make you feel badass and the combat feels smoother than I remember it being. It's also a really pretty game, the first level doesn't really show it due to the entire color pallet being rusty reds and browns, but the city ruins afterwards looks really nice with the dull-ish greys of the ruins with the vibrant greens of the forest that's growing over everything. Music is top notch and is definitely something that I'd listen to outside of the game. While she didn't compose it, the music really reminds me of Yuki Kajiura's work for whatever reason so if you've enjoyed her stuff (Madoka, Fate/Zero, SAO, .Hack//Sign as examples) then you'll probably like Automata's music as well.the valve accessory you get in the Day One Edition is surprisingly cute and its vibrant red color fits really well with 2B's entirely white and black attire.ALSO F I S H I N GTHE ULTIMATE OF ALL VIDEO GAME THINGS			"

												Fantastic game. Few problems, though.There are spoilers, but only within the spoiler tags.I have a GTX 1070. While the framerate is almost always 60, except for occasional stutters which are pretty ♥♥♥♥, the game uses an insane amount of GPU horsepower compared to how the game looks. My pc smashes the reccommended specs, yet it's concerning that a card like this is having trouble. Are people with anything less straight up ♥♥♥♥ed?The texture work and draw distance in most areas are, for lack of a better word, ♥♥♥♥. There also seems to be a weird problem with texture streaming, resulting in a low quality texture that only properly loads in after a delay. Oh, and stuttering.I'm not sure if I'm just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but I've encountered quite a few quests where I accept, go to the place, and the objective or NPC is missing. 11B's Memento comes to mind. I picked up the mission from 16D, went through the factory while simultaneously completing another objective. Arrived at the spot where her corpse should be, accompanied by an orange marker, just like any other quest, and she was nowhere to be found. Returning to 16D, who said the exact same line of text she had said before I departed, seemed to have made the body spawn. This also happened on The Wandering Couple questline. Twice.Invisible walls. I've heard of people saying ""Oh, it's just their way of messing with you."" Nah. It's just laziness. I get that there's supposed to be boundaries, but there's so many areas that should obviously be traversible, but aren't.The usual bugs that everyone is reporting. Resolutions above 900p in fullscreen are upscaled. Mouse cursor stuck on top of the screen etc. Not a huge deal, and there are workarounds. I hope this is fixed soon.It's not all bad. Not at all.The synnergy that 2B and 9S have as characters is charming, as are their ""operators"" who are somewhat like caretakers. Most of the characters are likable to an extent.The world building is amazing. The terrain, while often looking a little gaudy as far as textures and geometry go, is varied and interesting. The shortcuts make it all come together, and things make sense geographically for the most part. The colour palette is dark and gloomy, but it fits so well. The overall presentation is nice.The map is large, but not too large. Most of it is tightly packed to the point where traversal does not feel like a chore, yet is not so compressed that it seems like too much ♥♥♥♥ going on in the same area.The soundtrack is phenomenal. Easily one of the best soundtracks in a game I've heard for a long time. While some tracks don't stand out too much, others are great and the tunes will stick in your head. Overall, the package comes together great.2B got nice bootyThe side quests help flesh out the world, and are usually pretty interesting. Sometimes they're a bit frustrating, but I haven't had a game make me actively do the side quests and send me to areas I would otherwise visit once and never return, where I've noticed new things or found story information.Speaking of story, the way the story is delivered is interesting. It's fragmented, and doesn't always shove everything into your face. There's even subtle things in the background, like when 6O starts a communication with 2B because she confessed her feelings to another operator, who turned her down. I have a feeling that the operator she confessed to was 21O (9S' operator). The game, up to the point I've currently played to, (C) has not confirmed nor denied, but it's little things like this that are fun to think about.This is a good video game, sometimes it gets a bit edgy, and you may not like it for various other reasons such as genre, gameplay, characters, or even the art style. But if you like Yoko Taro games, or Platinum, or simply enjoy this type of game, give it a go. It might pay to wait until some of the issues are ironed out before buying, though.Oh, and one more thing. Think with your brain, not with your ♥♥♥♥.			"

												I could waffle on for a long time about every aspect of this game but I'll shorten it down instead. This whole game, every part in it, is solid. It's hard to find a flaw. Definately a game of the year contender. Easily in my top 10, might even be top 5. Get this game. It's worth lad.			"

												I cannot even begin to explain why I adored this game.The visuals, the story, the soundtrack, all of them were superb.The game, of course, makes a lot more sense if you've played Drakengard 1 and the original NieR, but it's not necessary to understand the story and get enjoyment, in fact I'd say having played the two previously mentioned titles would SPOIL some of the great twists present in the narrative.Buy this game, give Square Enix/Platinum Games/Yoko Taro your money.

												Pros:* Combat is really tight* Performance is great (i5 4460, 16gb ram and 1070) -- everything on max, 1080p60fps* The open world is really beautiful* The side quests are enticing.* Loving the voice actors/actresses -- they are great!* Even on normal, there's some difficulty (some enemies can one/two shot you if you don't pay attention. damn you wild boars!)* No hand holding at all. You start and the game tells you ""here's how you shoot, here's how you attack. play.""Cons:* Tons of texture pop-ins* Enemy variety is not that great* Getting your body back can get be a bit boring after a while* Tons of walking around doing nothing because of some side quests* The map is quite bad* Weapon variety is ehAll in all, it's a really great game. Totally recommend :)			"

												Specs: i7-4770K, R9 290X, installed on an SSDPerformance: solid 60fps at 1440pFirst some cons:- Full screen doesn't work correctly. It seems capped at 900p or something. So I play in windowed mode.- You really ought to use a controller- Fan service galore. Can't recommend this to my female friends.- Washed out color palate, similar to the first game, but gets tiresome after a while. A few points punctuated with color are welcome relief, but don't expect to see much more than brown, white, and a bit of green.Pros now:- Incredibly satisfying combat mechanics. Kind of a dumbed down Bayonnetta, but still very slick.- Setting is as dreamy as the last NieR, and nice to get lost in. Oddly relaxing.- Kind of addictive.... hang on, I just need to play a bit more.			"

The Story is fantastic, the grapics and fps are good for me (Besides Some Cutsenes) the soundtrack is outstanding and the combat is amazing as hell. If you are a Dark Souls Fan and played the old NieR games, you will love this one. So yea, I do recommend this game for you guys. It is a fun Open World Hack and Slash Action.			"

												Enjoying the game thus far. Fluent movement system and the boss battles remind me of the old school boss fights we used to have i.e. not tanky just shoot at me bullet sponges, but enemies which require timing, knowing their movements and attack patterns.

												New to the series. I haven't got into it a great deal but everything i have played thus far is really quite promising..The graphics are surreal and just beautiful, although i have encountered some frame drops via cutscenes which is for me a non factor (Running on a Gigabyte Laptop with single GTX980M) it is really not a problem for me (yet)The controls are really well optimized for me and no issues present with button mapping which is customizable in game ( I am using a wireless Xbox One Controller via receiver for the game).The story seems very interesting and promising and the Music is just so Fricking amazing and atmospheric!  Also 2B's knickers frequently flying in your face is always a +++ factor and oh so very.... yes yes you get the picture pervert. Overall i strongly advise you to purchase this game as it is really quite something and i have spent similiar money on other games which don't even nearly feel this fresh and very satisfying 10/10. Love the series.			"

												I hate single player games. I only bought this because I was extremely bored, and it turned out to be one of my best purchases in awhile.In a few short hours, I've had some of the best boss fights I've ever experienced in any video game. Everything feels larger than life, and 2Bs abilities make me feel like I can take on anything. Really the only negative for me is the amount of running I have to do to get to boss fights, but at least the music is good : ).

												First thing, absolutely incredible game.Although the port is pretty bad, playable at best. I'm running the game in windowed mode simply because i'm having issues with black borders/fuzzy resolution with full screen. I get a solid 60fps with no drops, gameplay feels incredibly smooth although cutscenes are still 30fps and are pretty choppy.My biggest irk is the lack of DualShock support, you'd think for a PS4/PC exclusive it'd atleast have that. I really hope they patch this within the next couple days as I can't wait to really get into the game as what i've played so far has been amazing.Specs -i7 7700kEVGA GTX 1080 SC16GB DDR4 RAM 2400MhzTL;DR - Game is incredible, port needs severe patching due to framerate caps, lack of DualShock support and resolution/full screen issues.

												This has been my first JRPG ever, and let me tell you, so far it has been an amazing game to open me up to the world of JRPGs and RPGs alike. In my first 8 hours of playthrough (which will probably be higher by the time you read this), I have experienced a challenge that actually punishes you for dying, fair and interesting progression, two unique and fun mini-boss battles, and an intense boss battle that required you to understand the mechanics fully to defeat the boss successfully.Pros:- Graphics: The graphics for me have been stunning and smooth. I have the game set at 1920x1080p with max texture settings (Nvidia 970) and have been experiencing almost no lag or frame drops. The closest I've come to lag/frame drops is when I teleport to another location and just load in, although the frame rate almost immediately fixes itself.- Story: The story in this game despite having a slightly cliche intro turns out to be intricate and unique in many ways. The general background of the story is that aliens have attacked Earth with their robots they've created, and the few humans who have survived fled to the Moon to begin the Resistance and YoRHa Android Infantry. You as 2B, the main character, are an android soldier in YoRHa whose been tasked with tough missions against the robots on Earth. From then on you learn all the twists and turns the game's story has to offer, and what has just begun to happen down on Earth.- Gameplay: The fighting/combat system was created by Platinum Games, and as I've seen and been told by others, there's no doubt that it's fantastic. And experiencing it for myself, I can safely come to the conclusion that those people are right. Nothing in the combat system felt clunky, there are not a ton of attacks and combos available which I personally prefer (having to learn and master 30+ attack pattterns/combos isn't that appealling to me), and the attack patterns/combos the combat system does have are well designed and very easy to pick up.- Music: As a gamer, music is something that I listen closely for. Nier Automata's soundtrack has been fantastic so far, with intense tracks for heated battles, calm and casual tracks for neutral/allied areas, and cheerful and upbeat tunes for the happier places in the world. This soundtrack has been so good so far that I have already listened to and fell asleep to it. Not sure if they've made the soundtrack purchasable yet, but if or once they release it I will most definitely instabuy it.Cons:- Choices: So far in my playthrough of Nier Automata, I have been faced with little to no choices I can make that affect what happens and what plays out in the game. Maybe I haven't gotten far enough yet to need to make important choices, but there are a few things that I would have liked to do or chosen to do different throughout the story so far. But if you expect a wide variety of choices or multiple choices you can make that affect the game, this game might not be the best for that.- Weapon Variety: I have come across a few choices of weapons so far, that look different and play slightly different, but none of them have been better than my upgraded original one yet. This may just be a problem on my end because I may need to get farther or explore some more, but otherwise I have no reason to buy a replacement weapon from the weapon shop at the Resistance Camp (one of the main places you head to often)Aside from that, there's really nothing else I can think of that needs improvement. The game is very polished and enjoyable in my opinion, and from the negative things I've seen people saying about this game, it's more than likely an issue with their hardware and graphics settings rather than the game's ""poor PC port."" Because I haven't had a single issue regarding the graphics on my end.			"

Main protaganist look very anime style(and very sexy) which I loveeeeee<3. Boss fights are EPIC and are definitely challenging. What I didn't like: Right after the download completes, there are tons of things you've got to do. For me, the game chose my Intel as the main display system instead of my Nvidia. And there were some graphics problems like the screen was flickering so I had to turn off the Vsync which solved the problem. Full screen = 1600x900 not 1080p but people discovered how to fix this. Well I personally played with 1366x768 simply because my computer was not good enough. Nvidia people had more issues with the graphics than Radeon people. But all and all, all issues are fixable.9/10 , I'd say the money was worth.			"

From then on you learn all the twists and turns the game's story has to offer, and what has just begun to happen down on Earth.- Gameplay: The fighting/combat system was created by Platinum Games, and as I've seen and been told by others, there's no doubt that it's fantastic. And experiencing it for myself, I can safely come to the conclusion that those people are right. Nothing in the combat system felt clunky, there are not a ton of attacks and combos available which I personally prefer (having to learn and master 30+ attack pattterns/combos isn't that appealling to me), and the attack patterns/combos the combat system does have are well designed and very easy to pick up.- Music: As a gamer, music is something that I listen closely for. Nier Automata's soundtrack has been fantastic so far, with intense tracks for heated battles, calm and casual tracks for neutral/allied areas, and cheerful and upbeat tunes for the happier places in the world. This soundtrack has been so good so far that I have already listened to and fell asleep to it. Not sure if they've made the soundtrack purchasable yet, but if or once they release it I will most definitely instabuy it.Cons:- Choices: So far in my playthrough of Nier Automata, I have been faced with little to no choices I can make that affect what happens and what plays out in the game. Maybe I haven't gotten far enough yet to need to make important choices, but there are a few things that I would have liked to do or chosen to do different throughout the story so far. But if you expect a wide variety of choices or multiple choices you can make that affect the game, this game might not be the best for that.- Weapon Variety: I have come across a few choices of weapons so far, that look different and play slightly different, but none of them have been better than my upgraded original one yet. This may just be a problem on my end because I may need to get farther or explore some more, but otherwise I have no reason to buy a replacement weapon from the weapon shop at the Resistance Camp (one of the main places you head to often)Aside from that, there's really nothing else I can think of that needs improvement. The game is very polished and enjoyable in my opinion, and from the negative things I've seen people saying about this game, it's more than likely an issue with their hardware and graphics settings rather than the game's ""poor PC port."" Because I haven't had a single issue regarding the graphics on my end.			"

												♥♥♥♥ me this game is brilliant.On the gameplay front, it's another Platinum Games masterpiece. The Bayonetta and MGR Platinum, not the starfox platinum. The only slight problem I have with the gameplay is 9S, I'd prefer to have heavy attacks for combos than an flash game hacking minigame as a heavy.And story wise, it's Yoko Taro through and through. Deep, relatively complex and very, very intriguing. I only wish it linked more to the original Nier than just the odd reference here and there, though it's still cool to see some returning characters.It's one of the most satisfying games i've ever played, up there with Dark Souls.P.S. Concerning the port, it seems it varies heavily based specifically on your setup. I've heard ""bad fps with high end PC"" and yet I manage to pull a constant 60 on max settings. I never had a single problem with the PC release.			"

												10/10 easily one of my favorite games of all time+Fascinating and powerful story and characters+Powerful feeling of scope+Artistic and aesthetic character and world design+Great combat system, reminiscent of dark souls and devil may cry+RPG elements are simple and well designed, I especially like the chip upgrade system+A few arcady feeling fights, camera angles and whatnot, touhou style gundam fights too+Didn't expect an open world but it works+Quests are fun and generally varied+dat soundtrack though+Other than the costume (which in my opinion is dope) there's no real fanservice, if you were worried this was panty simulator 2k17 then take solice in knowing that there are no actual panties, it is a leotard.-Lacks a few intricacies that would have made it perfect, difficult to describe, but the world could be more populated with more content. Not a blatant issueThese next few are me really reaching into the bucket for negatives-World design is low rez (The aesthetic is still on point though so I'd hardly call it a complaint)-Tutorial mission is pretty difficult at first and requires a new start piror to the first save. If you die within the first hour of the game you need to start again from scratch, intro cutscene and all. Pretty annoying on the third or fourth time.-Keyboard and mouse controlls aren't great, highly recomend a controllerAlso since it's been noted before, I have not had any problems with the port or subsequent graphics. There's a few annoying bugs but they're few and far between. These include execution moves not working and game crashes (I've encoutered 2 in 15 hours) Running gtx 970, amd i7 4790k and 16gb ram.Overall the atmosphere, gameplay, and story are insurmountable. The very few number of actual issues are overshadowed by the great experience you'll have playing this.			"

												Gameplay itself is solid and addictive. Runs extremely smooth on GTX 1070 and i7-4790K at 1080p. I've been having trouble putting the controller down since release, which is surprising to me because the reviews and gameplay I saw of the PS4 version released earlier this month didn't seem to be the most exciting but I bit the bullet anyways since Yoko Taro is a MF champ. Combat FLUIDITY and STYLE are ridiculously impressive, to the point where even if I've torn the same machine mob to scraps over and over, I'm still excited to go at it again. For anyone who's played Bayonetta 1/2 before, you understand the high points of this Platinum Games signature blend of combat fluidity and style. On the PC release of NieR:Automata, this is executed with intense style but not in excess. It's also MUCH CLEANER than previous Platinum-developed titles. Combat is fast and always has you on your toes, but it never skips a beat in every confrontation you enter, especially if you're playing on the higher difficulties. I wasn't interested much in the story concept when I was just learning about the premises of the NieR universe, but when I actually dove into the game, it was so easy to get gripped into everything going on around me. I just was not prepared for the level of weird (I say this in a good way) that was to come while progressing through the game. The basic premise is fairly vanilla and easy to understand from the game description and introductory scenes but the way it's executed is just, well, it's gonna leave you contemplating if you bought the game you thought you did in the first place. Combining this impressive combat system and a well-driven story with Mr. Taro's hundreds of genius eccentricities visible throughout the game create an impressively addictive work of art that's mischievously fun. It goes without saying that you have to experience it yourself to understand what I'm talking about. Don't be dissuaded by the high concentration of negative day one reviews complaining about small technical bugs, the fabulously unique gameplay experience and value in this package is worth what you pay.THAT SAID, although the technical problems don't affect the playability of the overall experience, they are noticeable enough to unfortunately burn the immersion from time to time. Cutscenes are unfortunately prerendered in 30fps, really punching you out of the game you were in when you've been playing at 60fps the whole time. In my experience with games in the past, this is probably never going to be changed no matter how much PCMR loses their ♥♥♥♥ about it. Normally I would forgive 30fps cutscenes if they were smooth (again, looking back to Bayonetta), but honestly the choppiness of these cutscenes would make me believe they were rendered on a standard home use desktop from 2008, which is really unfortunate. No really, *they're that bad* and it kills me that they plague this brilliant game's overall execution so significantly with some cutscenes just painfully giving you that 15fps Cinematic™ feel. In relation to framerate, the game is capped at 60fps, vsync on or off. Whether this matters to you or not depends on your monitor but I'm assuming most play on a 60 Hz panel anyways.There is also the resolution bug in which trying to play in fullscreen 1080p or above really screws the perceived framerate and actual resolution displayed. This can currently be fixed by using third-party apps such as ""Windowed Borderless Gaming"" and others the community has developed. It would have been nice if this problem didn't exist in the first place, it's 2017 for crying out loud. Once you manually iron this issue out yourself (although I dearly hope this issue isn't ignored for the sake of future players), the only things really disturbing are the poorly rendered cutscenes, which I BEG TO BE REDONE FOR THE SAKE OF HAVING A NEAR PERFECT GAME HERE.And of course, 2B T H I C C			"

												Overall - 9/10NieR:Automata is a 3rd person OTS story-driven spectacle fighter about a really pretty android fighting robots. Did I mention how pretty 2B is? The game takes place throughout several zones, with main quests and side quests ranging from fetch quests to escort quests to boss battles. After finishing your first playthrough (30 hours if you do the side quests), there are 4 more main playthroughs that dramatically change the game (many events are the same, but core mechanics change and the stories deviate), and provide replayability beyond normal NG+ systems. Great music, great visuals, great game. Weird graphics bugs which I hope get patched soon aside, I'd recommend this game.Combat: 9/10In NieR:Automata, the player can equip two weapons per loadout and can switch between two loadouts in the middle of combat. Weapons generally fall into light swords, heavy weapons, spears, and battle gauntlets (think Yang from RWBY). Because weapons in different configurations and situations perform different attacks, the player has a lot of freedom in customizing playstyle and how they fight. All of the weapons and attacks provide a lot of mobility so you rarely feel rooted in place, and fighting swarms of enemies is a lot of fun.Bosses come in a lot of different shapes, sizes, and attack patterns, including humanoids, large mechs, and giant mechs out of Shadow of the Colossus. Well placed dodges and timing attacks is important, but one complaint I've had is that most bosses can either be stunlocked or can barely be interacted with (one boss near the end has a phase where it goes invincible and harms you if you come close. The phase lasts much too long in my opinion, and a lot of the rest of the time, I was constantly breaking off pieces and stunning him, which made the fight a little underwhelming). Aesthetic/Direction -- 9/10NieR as a whole has a fairly muted color palette which makes the splashes of color in each area all the more interesting. Bright greens of the abandoned city and the forest contrast with the blues and greys of the flooded city and so on. Attacks are flashy and satisfying, enemies are interesting, characters are charming, and the immersion is really well done. The music in each area is absolutely wonderful and I'm surprised the OST doesn't come with the game or a dlc or something. The camera work is fascinating, and Platinum impressed me with how fluid the transition between over the shoulder 3rd person and side scrolling castlevania to top down shooter. Every change in perspective was refreshing and interesting, though some perspectives can make it difficult to play. Since a lot of combat happens in the air, a top down perspective makes it difficult to tell whether or not you are actually hitting an enemy or whiffing over its head, and some sidescrolling perspectives are really far away such that you can barely see 2B. Luckily you can change a lot of these camera settings in the options.Story -- ?/10NieR has 4 main storylines that dramatically change gameplay between playthroughs, adding and changing combat mechanics and minigames, etc. I've finished line A, and line B seems interesting. The story only gets more complex as you play, and I find myself caring a lot for 2B and 9S a lot more than most of the other characters. "

												I bought this game on PS 4 Pro and I bought it for PC. Such a masterpiece of a title, it's too bad it's not getting advertised at all. Not even on Sony's Store can you find this game without digging to find it. It'll be a Sleeper Hit title that will gain fans with time. The music is fantastic, the combat is super fun, and the dialogue is Fantastic!        It is however without faults, as most know already from reviews of the pc version, the game has full screen upscaling problems. The cutscenes also run at 900p 30fps. On the PS 4 Pro it runs at 1080p 60 fps... I'm sure a fix is on its way. Others report constant crashing. Fortunantly I haven't come across the crashing problems and I can get over the 30fps cutscenes. You also want to play this game with a Controller, I can't imagine playing this game with a keyboard. The game runs beautifully in windows mode, I use a Program called Borderless Gaming to get my Fullscreen enjoyment. PS4 Pro Version: 9/10PC Version: 8/10 "

The soundtrack is phenomenal, the story kept me hooked throughout my entire playthrough wanting to know what was going to happen. The combat is fluid and enjoyable as well as easy to pick up. My personal attachment to the characters by the end of this story was unreal and even brought me to tears in some cases, they were well written and the voice actors did an amazing job at bringing them to life!

												This game is great in my opinion.It has really good graphics, the environments are amazing and the theme really strikes my personal fancy. The music is also well put together and fits the environment and intensity very nicely.The gameplay is fluid and fast-paced with seamless transitions between the various gameplay elements (Shmup, hack and slash, side scrolling action) as well as enough depth in each so that none feel underdeveloped. The hack and slash is the main experience though the other types are never a chore to go through either and platforming definitely leaves you feeling as though you are in control of a powerful and agile character.Storywise the game excells as well, the cinematics are vibrant and easy to watch (and skippable!) and the other story-telling devices (such as chatter and journals and other collectibles) are optional enough that they aren't intrusive, but if you take the time to read/listen to what the various characters have to say then the story is enriched. There are a few issues though, which in no way should spoil your enjoyment.Personally I haven't had any issues with stability/graphical glitches/crashes and my rig isn't too high spec but apparently a lot of people have issues with Gpu compatibility and various crashes. If you're interested, check the discussions for problems with similar setups, if you can't find any give it a try and see how it runs, don't be afraid to refund it if it doesn't work for you.The initial gameplay sequence is difficult to get through, owing to the first save point being after a boss. While not terribly difficult, a mistake and/or death can be costly as it means you have to sit through the lengthy opening sequence and fights therafter. Feel free to start on a lower difficulty before the first save point if you have difficulties, since the game's difficulty can be changed at any time from the settings.Overall this game sits perfectly in my zone of interest and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who thinks they might enjoy a highly atmospheric world full of interesting characters and fun combat action.

												PC Port is beautiful a bit confusing at first with the controls depending which gameplay mode your character is in at the time. There are occasional frames per second loss depending on how your settings are and your computer runs, This game also requires a lot of hand-eye coordination and memory for combos and tactics on its higher difficulties. The only downside I can say is on easiest mode or easy mode whatever you want to call it the game basically plays for you, which is both amusing and frustrating as it leaves you with little to do playerwise. Now I'm speaking as a fan of the NieR/Drakengard/Drag On Dragoon franchise, a new fan but a fan none the less, this game is glorious, I am such a die-hard fan that you can choose to look over my review because it's very hard for me to find something wrong.

												NieR Automata is fast becoming one of my favourite games of all time.  The game traverses between a first-person hack 'n' slash, 2D platformer, side-shooter and overhead-view, and it works really well.  The combat system is simple but effective, the bosses are challenging without being OP, the storyline is as wonderfully weird as you'd expect from a Yoko Taro game and the soundtrack is one of the best I've ever come across.  Seriously, it needs to be released as a stand-alone, it's that good. Drawbacks?  Well, sometimes fights can get a little confusing if you're up against a lot of enemies at once, and the tutorial is needlessly long.  Other than that, NieR Automata should be a serious contender for GOTY, IMHO.			"

												I didn't go into Nier:Automata with any great expectations, I simply was looking for a fun game to play to fill a lull in my gaming life, but what I got was so much more. First thing's first; I've never played a Nier or Drakengard game before this one so you don't need that level of familiarity to enjoy this game, though I don't doubt it would add more to the experience. The combat is fast paced, varied, and fun without being overbearing so of you're looking for a game that actually is just fun to PLAY then this is your game. However, it's the story and the emotion it brings to bear that really prompted me to write out a review. Most of your time will be spent getting to know our stylish androids better, but if you see everything the game has to offer you'll feel a part of this world and this community in a way few games are capable of achieving. To summarize an already brief summary, I wholeheartedly recommend it.			"

												Two of my favorite gaming genres are fighting games and shmups, I love arcade style action. Platinum managed to blend those styles of play into a JRPG of all things leaving me very impressed.I came to this game via being a fan of Platinum. I never played the first Nier game and don't play a ton of RPGs in general. This combat system is a bit more forgiving than games like Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, which Platinum also designed, but I totally loved it. The boss battles were especially rewarding with timing of blocks and counter attacks and on-the-fly weapon loadout swaps.The system of managing your character's stats as chips is also really cool. You have a finite area to plug them in, and the more special chips (with a diamond symbol) can perform the same routine while taking up a smaller number of ""slots"" so you get the same stat boost more efficiently. The game allows you to re-arrange and swap out chips to rebuild your entire character's spec as needed. I really enjoyed remapping the whole stack for boss encounters - really unique system and I hope other games steal this idea.I just finished playing my 3rd play through (2nd is a different perspective same timeline, 3rd is continuation of the story so at least 3 plays needed, don't stop!) and wow - it shot to the top 5 games of all time for me. Don't miss it - what a surprise. A Masterpiece like this doesn’t come along very often.			"

												♥♥♥♥ me this game is brilliant.On the gameplay front, it's another Platinum Games masterpiece. The Bayonetta and MGR Platinum, not the starfox platinum. The only slight problem I have with the gameplay is 9S, I'd prefer to have heavy attacks for combos than an flash game hacking minigame as a heavy.And story wise, it's Yoko Taro through and through. Deep, relatively complex and very, very intriguing. I only wish it linked more to the original Nier than just the odd reference here and there, though it's still cool to see some returning characters.It's one of the most satisfying games i've ever played, up there with Dark Souls.P.S. Concerning the port, it seems it varies heavily based specifically on your setup. I've heard ""bad fps with high end PC"" and yet I manage to pull a constant 60 on max settings. I never had a single problem with the PC release.			"

												I'm bought this game going in completely blind, just off of what a friend told me, the gameplay trailer and a webtoon i just read called Nanos List. (b.c androids). I'm enjoying it pretty solidly so far.Here are some things: - Quicksave where ever you can! I made that mistake, luckily really early. - Game runs pretty good! No fps lag so far, even with the huge boss/mini boss fights. - I usually love running a keyboard/mouse setup but I don't think I can with this game. I resorted to using my XB1 controller (runs pretty well! If you have Windows 10 you should already have the drivers installed, just plug the controller into a USB slot and enjoy.)- If you DO use a keyboard setup,  you're going to have to tweek it, how you tweek it is going to be your own preference. - Will add more helpful tips/tricks as I think of them!

												This game is amazing and needs to be bought. However, it needs to be done so on PS4 at the moment. The game is recommended absolutely, this platform is not atm.Get the game on PS4. This was a game currently developed for console. I waited for the PC release today because of obvious wanting to try the game on my more powerful system. Running an Intel i7 and GTX 1080 so my rig is more than capable of handling the game. However, the optimization isn't there. The cutscenes run worse than in game graphics. The default keyboard mapping is not fluid at all. And the mouse sensitivity is all over the place. When aiming in the bullethell mode you're expected to use the keyboard arrows instead of the mouse. The mouse is way too sensitive in the bullethell mode, but slow when trying to move the camera in CQC. There is no dodge button, but you're instead expected to double tap the movement arrows. However the timing and animations are off and make dodging a much more difficult task than it should be. Not to mention if you want the game to actually run at the full 1080P settings, you can't fullscreen. It's only windowed, or fullscreen, no windowed full screen. And when it is full screened, the resolution is not 1080. And it will be off-centered and worse looking than in the windowed display at 1080. I played through the demo on PS4 and had a much better experience. I played the same length on the PC and was very disappointed with it's running. Refunding on Steam and going to gamestop to get the game for PS4 and now have to pay horrendous tax and deal with the drive and people. We all now how it is.TL;DR - NieR is going to be a great game. It definitely needs to be purchased. However, if you cannot wait to do so, then buy it on the PS4 because the PC port is not going to do it justice.EDIT: I've seen people recommending third party fixes. It's a valid argument, I suppose. But it shouldn't be necessary. The PS4 version runs fine as is. There shouldn't be a need for a third party application to run this game. Unfortunately, if you want to play it now, buy it for console.			"

												[I ""finished"" the game, as in I finished the main endings and am now in the process of 100%ing it, this Review contains very minor spoilers.]This could very well be my new favorite game ever.The fighting is great (although I feel like 2B is still the best, 9S might me the most powerful due to his hacking ability, but judging from pure fighting, 2B feels like the best allrounder) and allows lots of variety with different weapon types in either the light or heavy attack slot, I personally mostly used two heavy weapons for example. Different Plugin-Chips allow for further specialization. The System for Plugins is great in general, allowing you to even sacrifice UI elements for more splots for other things. My only complaint in that regard is that the same Chips don't stack, so your inventory can get a little cramped, so it's best to sell or fuse regularly. Sometimes it can be useful to have different upgrades for certain quests.The different pods (that you can switch on the fly) can also be upgraded and equipped with different powers, there's a lot to customize and improve in the game.The hacking game is sometimes a little easy, but it's still a nice variation from the normal (although when playing 9S it get's a little tedious, cause it's technically his main attack).But a good fighting system was kinda to be expected since this is a Platinum game.I came for the combat, and stayed for everything else.The story and lore of this world is so interesting, I wanna explore every last bit of it.It's hard to explain, but this game keeps suprising you with new twists, story and gameplay-wise.Again, this might be my favorite game ever in terms of singleplayer games. And to everyone who is interested in some aspect of the game, or even just curious or open enough to try it, I can only recommend it to you.A little bit about the technical side of the game (since early reports claimed some issues),I get steady 60fps in all situations on Highest settings 1080p, and 55-60fps on 4k medium settings.Keep in mind that the game is locked at 60fps and officially doesnt support resolutions beyond 1080p.This is my setup:-MSI 980Ti Gaming-intel Core i5 6600k @ 4.6GHz-16GB HyperX Fury DDR4Test on my notebook (960m+i7-4720HQ):Runs at 40-60fps in 1366×768 on low details.

												I'm having fun with the game and don't have much negative to say, however there are a few things that I hope get fixed. Gameplay is fun and feels like a open world mixture of games like Devil May Cry, Dynasty Warriors, and Legend of Zelda (Certain combat elements from past 3D games I mean), along with some 3D bullet hells. The story is interesting and so far, so are the characters. For me the framerate runs fine during the gameplay and has no real problems, however the complete opposite can be said for the cutscenes, where I guess the game decides to turn my graphics card into a potato and run everything poorly. I'm hoping some type of patch with come out to fix it. Other than I'd say the game is really fun and makes interesting use of things like death, results of the death of other players, and exploration. Odd subjects, but you'll understand once you play. Definitely recommended.			"

I can still hear my character jump and attack in the background but I'm staring at a frozen screen.  The game looks fun for what i've seen on through videos.

That being said, the game is still very fun and offers a very unique style of gameplay. while playing it will switch from a third person view to a 2D side scroller, to a Top Down Shooter fairly seamlessly. This does however mean that the KB+M controls are absoluete garbage. If you play this game you will need a controller. This is a pretty bad port, but the game is still fun. the best way to describe it would be to look at Dark Souls.

Anything harder than normal gives an experience reminiscent of a Dark Souls game (maybe even harder) so if you're looking for that challenge, this game is great! If you aren't looking for a challenge, the game is still amazing on the medium mode!!			"

												So far, so good. There are some issues with the port, but that goes without saying. There are workarounds/fixes currently and it is working well for me.Aside from the performance, I'm enjoying the game thus far, and would like to recommend it to those who are curious to try. I will likely update my review as i play through the game.			"

												Great game, poor port.Some of the issues of this port are:- Broken full screen mode.- Low res textures- Low res shadows- insane popping elements- frame pacing issuesI've changed my review to positive not because theyhave fixed the game but because I'm having so much fun with it.			"

												Borderless gaming and disabled instant replay and I have 1080p max quality and 60FPS no drops. Gameplay is great and the sound track is amazing, always been a fan of Yoko Taro games but wouldn't recommened them to most people but this one I would.45 hours to get through the game actually and still have some of the smaller endings to do, this game is amazing.

												Not gonna mince words here, Nier Automata is experience like none I've ever had before in a game and you should totally play it, because holy ♥♥♥♥ it is worth playing.If I had to nitpick then the map takes a bit of getting used to and the graphics are a tad washed out and crap. It's not very hard to ignore that stuff though as the game is just so damn good. Pretty much everything else is excellent as far as I'm concerned and the music might be the best I've heard in a game yet.And if you do play it, go into NG+. I'm not gonna spoil but there is a LOT more stuff after you ""complete"" the game the first time.			"

The story is interesting so far also if you have played or know the lore of the Nier games it makes some of the items and people more interesting.I have had minor frame drops on my 1060 and other than that no problems with the port.The ability to completely rebind your controller in the game is awesome suprised that more developers are not doing this.

It has a lot of different styles all in 1, side scrolling action, to hack in slash in 3rd person mode... and it's done very well. The camera works well and the visuals are excellent.

												How do I say this...At first I wanted to give this game a negative review because of the bad PC port. It was horrid. Crashes, sttutering, you name it.However with a little bit of work and with the help of the FAR mod (which solved most of the crashing/stuttering problem), I can finally experience the game.And oh my god. This game is not a game. It's art.+The music is insane. Every single location have a theme and it is stunning.+The storytelling on this game is one of the best I've ever seen.+It actually has a pretty high replaybility.+the graphics is beautiful, the character models are very detailed.+2B is waifu material.+Combat animations are sick, new players can just do hack and slash, while some experienced players can pull off some interesting combos.- If you are playing on PC, the controls are clunky.- The message system (You can leave a message next to your corpse when you die) is pretty useless.I definitly think this game is worth $60, and if you did get it, DO NOT WATCH/READ ANY SPOILERS!!!!! It ruins your experience.			"

												One of the best games i played in long time along with witcher 3 ofc, this game has outstanding story and its toryteling lets you speechless in some of the plot twists. Highly recomend to any RPG fans out there you wont regret it. Graphic could be better but what do we want when games are made for consoles than made as PC ports, in this case the only downside for me was the fullscreen windowed option not there. And when you have it on Fullscreen the resolution is not properly adjusted and you are playing something like 1024x720.I would give it a solid 9/10 (1 point down for the resolution and graphic problems , which i fixed with Windowed borderles gaming software). Story told from 3 perspektives by playign 3 different android units. Tons of plot twists, side quests, weapons and skill combinations to choose from.Highly recomend !  "

												This game is one of the best this year, i am suprised by how well this is done, for a japenes console title it really is above my expectations, i have played through the first story line and very much enjoyed everything in the game, the gameplay, the music (THE MUSICE), the graphics although it is a console port, the story line is quite diffrent to what i am used to but nonetheless it still is great, as for the issues mentioned by other players thankfully i havent seen any in my experiance, am running a GTX1080 and have not seen frame drops or glitches as of yet, the cutscenes run at 30fps but i guess that was intentional, other than that i think this is one if the best games i played in the past few years and i have played many, for what it is, its worth the money, i woulkd recomend it not just for anime and japenese games fans, but anyone who is looking to play a great RPG hack and slash game.i hope more japenes devs make such games not only targeting anime fans.

The only bad thing is that its not really good for PC. I bought a controller which i found a lot easier. It works to play with keyboard and mouse but customization is a must. Also the quality of the game in fullscreen 1080p was bugged. So i had to download a thirdpart program to make the windowmode borderless.

												Some issues, overall seems to be a decent conversion (especially considered the typical standard of japanese games ported on PC).I compared it to the PS4 and PS4 Pro version, here's my comments in detail1) Framerate is much more stable than even the PS4 Pro, locked at 60fps. Only saw TWO small drops in the first section of the game, even in areas where some frames would be skipped on the PS4 Pro (lava section underground in the lava factory). Framerate is 30fps for cut-scenes, don't remember if this was the case for PS4/Pro versions too but I assume it was.2) There's no borderless windowed mode. Fullscreen is lost if you alt-tab3) Game doesn't run at real 1080p if you set it that way, but something slightly lower. 900p? Bit higher probably. There's a small black frame if you set fullscreen 1080p4) The additional effects present on the Pro version, are also present on the PC versionGame is still as extraordinaire as the console version, hope they can fix those small annoying issues, but I got no hopes for that. Being that the game runs on DENUVO I'm afraid modders won't be able to fix them either.I tested the game on a GTX 1070 with an intel i7 3770, windows 10			"

												Large open world and high action combat makes for a good blend for action fans and the types who enjoy exploring. Game runs reasonably well even when using a GTX 760 for those worried about performance. The action combat is quite unforgiving, even on normal. But thats a good thing. Its not overly difficult (unless you play on hardest setting), the bad guys have visual and audio queues for attacks meaning with good timing you can get away without geting touched. However, failing to dodge an attack can leave you chugging health restores even vs the most basic of baddie.As my first venture into the series, I'm quite happy with how this game was designed. The plot needs a little bit of fine tuning, but flows reasonably well.All in all, solid game. 7/10			"

This title really caught me off guard as I could not stop playing until I got endings A through E which are the required endings to fully understand the game. I havent been this invested in single player story driven game in such a long time that it brought great joy to my heart as I just had to know what was going to happen next.Now the pros of the game+Music is absolutly fantastic and would rate as one of the best video game soundtracks of all time+Sounds are varied and bring life to actions+Engaging and fanstic story that had me hooked +Really good atmosphere+Really good hack and slash combat with top down shooter mix and mash gameplay+Beautiful character animations and unique character design+Great character interactions from funny to heart wrenching+Side quest dont feel like a chore and help with weapon upgrade matierals, no annoying faming (most of the leveling up comes from side quests)Cons-Game looks pretty dated-Top down shooting sections really start to overstay there welcome-F#$k escort side quest only ones I didnt likeIt took me 46 and half hours to get endings A to E which spanned exactly a week of playing from the release date of the game. It is well worth the money, and if your tight on money at least check it out when it goes on sale. Oh be aware of performance issues which theres mod fixes out there for.			"

Game has been out for 4 days and I stopped talking to my friends and abandoned all homework for it. Holy ♥♥♥♥ this game was really good. Don't worry about the port or your computer running it. If you are unsure, buy it and if it doesn't work out, refund it. You will probably need Borderless Gaming, available for free on GitHub. Even though I already beat it, I started an NG+ playthrough and the game is continuing to surprise me. I would not be surprised to spend many more hours in this game. I cannot recommend this game enough, it is absolutely phenomenal.Ran fine on my GTX 750ti at 1600x900 windowed.Edit: A driver update pushed this up to a full 1080p, though I did experience a fair amount of FPS issues very close to the end of ending C.

												First off, I came into this not playing any of the previous games and just based off of the trailer/screenshots and thought what the heck. Holy. ♥♥♥♥ing. ♥♥♥♥. This is probably the most fun I've had with a game since the release of Skyrim, GTA and possibly even Rocket League (I know the genres are different; speaking on fun factor here). I've never played a game quite like. It's got some of everything, from arcade-like combat, to a twin stick shooter, to a hacking mini-game, to Dark Souls ""holy ♥♥♥♥ wtf"" style bosses. Exploration is encouraged and rewarded with side-quests. The humor in the game is just right. Too many times I've played games in which developers ""over-did"" humor, making it seem like some sort of B-movie.Pros: Diverse Gameplay Beautiful Graphics/Scenery 2Booty Fun Combat Mechanics Interesting Story; a lot of ""what is life"" sprinkled throughout Soundtrack is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing Voice acting is good Amazing game atmosphere/settingCons: Some grahics issues on certain hardware. I've not personally had any issues other than a framerate dip.  60fps cap. Not a gamebreaker for me even though I'd like higher Sometimes 9S can get in the way when you're picking stuff up. For the 1000th time I don't want to change your combat style, 9S.All in all I'd give this game a 9/10. It's definitely worth the money in my opinion. And this is coming from someone that does often play Hack n' Slash RPG's. I'm sure you'll find this to be your ""new favorite game"" in your steam library. I couldn't put it down the day I bought it. Give it a shot.  "

												Amazing game, questionable port problems by Square Enix. Pros:The combat is tight and fluid.The soundtrack is stellar, Keiichi Okabe has nailed it once again.There's quite a sizable amount of graphics settings available.I get a pretty stable 60fps at 1080p.Cons: Resolution upscale issues and KB-M controls need fixing. Highly recommend using a controller due to the SHMUP/Twin-stick elements of the game. Crashes seem to occur for AMD GPUs.I imagine this will be fixed relatively soon, as the rest of the game is stellar, but I would have imagined a better release after there being such a sizable wait between console and PC releases.GPU: GTX 980CPU: Intel (R) Core (TM) i7-6700k  4.5 GHz Memory: 32 GB RAM (4x 8GB DDR3)Resolution: 1920x1080 60HzHDD: 2 TBSSD: 256 GBStill a masterpiece that I will hold close to my heart. But I would encourage those on the fence to wait for an official response by Square Enix and a patch to fix the aforementioned issues.			"

												The game has some glaring issues with performance. During my play through at the 12 hour mark I had unfortunatley experianced two game crashing bugs and various graphical issues. Hopefully these issues get patched out soon because the game is truely an astounding experiance. Characters, story, music, graphics (when they worked), and gameplay are all top-notch. A highly recommand for anyone who enjoys single player experiances like ""The Witcher"", ""Dark Souls"", and ""Monster Hunter"" if they are willing to focus more on story than gameplay (and the stroy is very engaging).

												Great game. I hate its overused ""God bashing"" philosophy cliche, but its a fresh experiance worth trying. Graphic art looks amazing. Most of the story surrounds the main charecter, so common robots have no depth and are just hack and slash targets. Maps are also hack and slash and mission support, meaning the scenery pretty much has no value than looking good. No ""Goron city"" or any iconicness to the area you expore. The boss battles and music are amazing and may make up for all the flaws you might notice			"

												Going into this game, I knew nothing about Nier outside of it looking interesting. Now that I am close to finishing my 2nd playthrough I must say that I really like the game. The story CAN be fairly short if you skip side quests, but the game is also meant to be played through a few times. I love how the game implements different playstyles in to one game (bullet hell, side scroller, ect...). Sometimes they feel a bit too forced, but nonetheless end up feeling good and keeping the game interesting and changing.For those who are having fullscreen/windowed issues, there are programs out to help with it, I use something called ""windowedborderlessgaming"" from a WesTech site and it works great for me.

A Windowed Borderless would definitely be recommended for this game. Asude from the above cons, gameplay is extremely enjoyable, addicting, while still difficult, and feels really smooth. The subtitles are off-sync to Japanese audio in most voice sequences, so it breaks immersion slightly, but otherwise, I am thoroughly enjoying my experience in this game.

												ok first let's talk about the bugs and issue the fullscreen bug that the one i found i've setting at 1920X1080 fullscreen but it's just 1600X1024 stretcting so i figure it out that you'll need to setting at windows and using programs like borderless gaming and you'll get full screen at your monitor resolution (mine 1920X1080) that's all problem solvedthis is all bugs that i've found after playing for 9 hourswell let's talk about the gameplay as you all well know for platinums games this was like DMC+MGR RISING with open world (and hot chick with nice butt)the combo goes smoothly and i really enjoys that you can switching weapons to Heavy and Light (and in easy mod there's an auto switch but other diffuculty doesn't)and you'll have cute shota (9S) alongside your journey (and little robot for shooting) he is really dependable because you don't have to worry about him he's no HP and does some damage that no more no lessfor the performance my gears is GTX970 I54460 8GB of ram and i setting it on high and AAX4 (some folk says that is no need just X2 will fine) 1080Pi didn't turn on fps monitor but from what i saw FPS run along by 40-60 which totally fine for me and there's some freezing for 1-2 sec at some point but that not bothered me at allthe story is amazing so far from the starts and there's 26 endings you can get (A-Z) and for the last thing that i really love about that is Soundtrack i might say that if they has Soundtrack available i'm gonna grab it for sureso if you are not offend by playing female protagonist and really love hack and slash plus open-world and Great Soundtrack (oh and probably didn't having potato computer) i'll recommended you should grab this game  "

												Was quite frustrated with this game at first, mainly because the controls on PC are so strange, but soon it got fun, and the story line is fantastic so far. If you liked the first game, I could honestly say you'll like this one. It's a little slow paced in the beginning (as most games like this tend to be) but it does indeed pick up.			"

												The game has some glaring issues with performance. During my play through at the 12 hour mark I had unfortunatley experianced two game crashing bugs and various graphical issues. Hopefully these issues get patched out soon because the game is truely an astounding experiance. Characters, story, music, graphics (when they worked), and gameplay are all top-notch. A highly recommand for anyone who enjoys single player experiances like ""The Witcher"", ""Dark Souls"", and ""Monster Hunter"" if they are willing to focus more on story than gameplay (and the stroy is very engaging).

Beware: the game ran by default on my integrated video card. I had to go in Steamapps, find the file, right-click on it and pick 'run with graphics processor...'I believe many steam users couldn't recommend the game because they didn't know the solution to this common problem.

												This game is one of the best this year, i am suprised by how well this is done, for a japenes console title it really is above my expectations, i have played through the first story line and very much enjoyed everything in the game, the gameplay, the music (THE MUSICE), the graphics although it is a console port, the story line is quite diffrent to what i am used to but nonetheless it still is great, as for the issues mentioned by other players thankfully i havent seen any in my experiance, am running a GTX1080 and have not seen frame drops or glitches as of yet, the cutscenes run at 30fps but i guess that was intentional, other than that i think this is one if the best games i played in the past few years and i have played many, for what it is, its worth the money, i woulkd recomend it not just for anime and japenese games fans, but anyone who is looking to play a great RPG hack and slash game.i hope more japenes devs make such games not only targeting anime fans.

While we were there we went to a restaurant where I had the best pulled pork sandwich I have ever eaten in my life. In fact, I was quite sad when I was done eating it. This game is that pulled pork sandwich my friends.With a compelling story as usual from Yoko Taro, a god-tier soundtrack, and superb combat/gameplay mechanics thanks to Based Platinum, you wind up with my personal game of the year. Maybe even of the decade. I highly recommend to almost anyone to pick this up. As long you have the specs to run it that is. 11/10 butt of the year			"

												Nier: Automata is a crazy, beautiful, and highly entertaining journey full of nutty ideas and awesome gameplay.

												As of right now, I cannot recommend this game to any AMD card owners. The screen frequently turns white and you won't be able to see any thing. I've updated my drivers, verify the cache, and tried many other things to fix this but it has not worked. Another thing is that you cannot save the game until you're a hour or so into the game. I've played the introduction at least five times now and every single time, I was forced to close my game due to the white screen and restart from the beginning.EDIT: It seems that the community has found a fix to the white screen bug. I uninstalled my current driver and reinstalled the 16.11.5 version. I was finally able to play the game without the white screen bug.PROS:-Fluid and awesome looking combat system. The hack and slash element works and fits the theme of the game perfectly.-Amazing soundtrack. The music really draws you into the world you are exploring for the full immersion.-Good voice acting. (I'm playing with the Japanese VO)-Keyboard controls are surprisingly good once you get use to it. It's very simple and not at all hard to get use to.CONS:-This game suffers from poor optimization and many other technical bugs that render the game unplayable for many people.-A lot of pop-in that ruins the immersion of exploration. (Grass, trees, buildings, etc)Overall, I would suggest this game for any one who's into hack and slash type of game. It's definitely worth picking up!			"

												This has been my first JRPG ever, and let me tell you, so far it has been an amazing game to open me up to the world of JRPGs and RPGs alike. In my first 8 hours of playthrough (which will probably be higher by the time you read this), I have experienced a challenge that actually punishes you for dying, fair and interesting progression, two unique and fun mini-boss battles, and an intense boss battle that required you to understand the mechanics fully to defeat the boss successfully.Pros:- Graphics: The graphics for me have been stunning and smooth. I have the game set at 1920x1080p with max texture settings (Nvidia 970) and have been experiencing almost no lag or frame drops. The closest I've come to lag/frame drops is when I teleport to another location and just load in, although the frame rate almost immediately fixes itself.- Story: The story in this game despite having a slightly cliche intro turns out to be intricate and unique in many ways. The general background of the story is that aliens have attacked Earth with their robots they've created, and the few humans who have survived fled to the Moon to begin the Resistance and YoRHa Android Infantry. You as 2B, the main character, are an android soldier in YoRHa whose been tasked with tough missions against the robots on Earth. From then on you learn all the twists and turns the game's story has to offer, and what has just begun to happen down on Earth.- Gameplay: The fighting/combat system was created by Platinum Games, and as I've seen and been told by others, there's no doubt that it's fantastic. And experiencing it for myself, I can safely come to the conclusion that those people are right. Nothing in the combat system felt clunky, there are not a ton of attacks and combos available which I personally prefer (having to learn and master 30+ attack pattterns/combos isn't that appealling to me), and the attack patterns/combos the combat system does have are well designed and very easy to pick up.- Music: As a gamer, music is something that I listen closely for. Nier Automata's soundtrack has been fantastic so far, with intense tracks for heated battles, calm and casual tracks for neutral/allied areas, and cheerful and upbeat tunes for the happier places in the world. This soundtrack has been so good so far that I have already listened to and fell asleep to it. Not sure if they've made the soundtrack purchasable yet, but if or once they release it I will most definitely instabuy it.Cons:- Choices: So far in my playthrough of Nier Automata, I have been faced with little to no choices I can make that affect what happens and what plays out in the game. Maybe I haven't gotten far enough yet to need to make important choices, but there are a few things that I would have liked to do or chosen to do different throughout the story so far. But if you expect a wide variety of choices or multiple choices you can make that affect the game, this game might not be the best for that.- Weapon Variety: I have come across a few choices of weapons so far, that look different and play slightly different, but none of them have been better than my upgraded original one yet. This may just be a problem on my end because I may need to get farther or explore some more, but otherwise I have no reason to buy a replacement weapon from the weapon shop at the Resistance Camp (one of the main places you head to often)Aside from that, there's really nothing else I can think of that needs improvement. The game is very polished and enjoyable in my opinion, and from the negative things I've seen people saying about this game, it's more than likely an issue with their hardware and graphics settings rather than the game's ""poor PC port."" Because I haven't had a single issue regarding the graphics on my end.			"

												If you are like I was when I bought this game then you aren't familiar with the series, and that's OK. I really enjoyed it and I will say the demo is not indicative of a majority of the game. I am personally not a fan of bullet hell games, and if you arent either than rest assured there are fairly few top down arcade style dodge and weave sequences. Some of the boss fights feel lazy and some feel really good. The weapon and ability upgrades feel very in depth and the game rewards exploration. I will say there is a lack of character customization. I know it's an rpg with a specific main character but if they at least would've let me change the color of 2b's dress or maybe put more hair ties and hats in the game i would have been satisified. The game doesn't tell you everything, which is nice since it means there are mechanics and abilities that can be used in different ways and discovering them as a player feels awesome. The mechanics are good, i believe the studio who made nier:automata also made beyonetta and one other? Overall a solid 8/10, which is a high score for me.  The two major downsides for me is that it can feel kind of repetative and grindy sometimes, but it is a hack and slash and the story kind of detracts from the grindy aspects of it. Also cutscenes don't show what weapon you are using, it just shows the default kitana which i find lame. Also fishing is fun and the best way to get money.			"

												While i do enjoy the game and looks well crafted.  It does have its irregularities including stuttered movement almost like a slowing of response to keystroke.  glitch patches pop up from time to time and the first hour i played was trying to make it through the intro.  lol i think i will either wait for a few patches or upgrade my GPU because that may be the issue to.  Even though my GPU is hardly outdated.  Will update review upon returning to play.-second entry,  Got to the boss fight and died no save method found still so have to start from beginning even though game said saving on top right corner.

												Really good game, I'll just say that even with all the problems, I am still enjoying the game a hell of a lot.But there are problems though.- Crashes, combined with no autosaving this one can be quite a ♥♥♥♥♥.- Resolution seems to be a bit off, not sure what that is about.- Dropped frames during cutscenes. Honestly can't tell if it's my computer or the game that's being weird.- Open world feels very closed off, with a lot of invisible walls. Not too big of an issue, but it makes the world feel a lot more empty. Especially if you're trying to enter a building with a large whole in the wall, and you get blocked by a wall that isn't there.But it really is a lot of fun, story's pretty good too. Bossfights have been a lot of fun so far, but I strongly suggest turning up the difficulty option to hard. Very hard is just silly hard though.			"

												First impressions on how the game runs. I am running a 970 with no problems having a smooth 60 fps at 2560x1440 with no work arounds or tweaks needed. So the graphical issues are not universal. Cutsenes are limited to 30 fps, which is a drag, but not anything that makes the game unplayable. Just a bit jarring. No black bars or anything.As for controlls, I'm playing with the Steam Controller and it works brilliantly. Haven't tryed kb+m yet, but no real reason to if you have a SC.So far it has been one of the best and most refreshing gameplay experiences I have had in a long time. Sadly it is kind of a crap shoot to see if you are able to run it or if you have issues, but I expect a quick patch to take care of that soon.			"

												I liked the gameplay when I could play it but now the game crashes and goes to a small white window everytime I try to run it. I'm assuming this might be an issue with AMD chipset because I run an Fx9590 CPU, Radeon R9 390x 8GB VRAM, 16GB RAM. I love the game and really want to play it, but I guess I have to wait until either they release a patch that remedies this issue with AMD chipsets or wait till AMD releases a new update for Crimson. Till then I guess I'll just watch this sit in my library while I wait. T.TEdit: Well I turned off AA and dropped Texture Filter to I think about 6 or 8 and I get like 40-45 FPS. I'm just assuming the game isn't optimized for AMD so until they patch it later on.			"

Usually, I'm a one and done type of guy but Nier has kept me coming back. Yes, I did unlock all the main endings. Now, I'm starting a new save to experience the game with the English voice acting. I have barely ever replayed games before. That is how amazing Nier Automata is. The story and gameplay are enough for me to go for a second round. You will connect with the characters.

												AMAZING. I was super hyped for this and could have been easily let down... but let me say, this game is CRAZY and incredible and beautiful and everything I hoped it would be. I have an NVIDIA 1070 and have had absolutely no problems running it, no crashes or fps drops, nothing. Fullscreen is fine too. I did read the reviews on here before playing and I was super worried it would run like crap. I have turned off AA and Vsync just in case, and I haven't tried the game with these settings turned on. So I would say just make sure your computer can handle this game before buying. My boyfriend has an NVIDIA 1060 and his is almost as good, only some rare fps drops. I have played some BAD ports in my time, and this is pretty smooth and great in my opinion. It's day one, after all!I've been playing for about 4 hours now, and the story has already got me hooked, but the real draw is the beautiful, ballet-like combat. You fly through the air using all sorts of combos and it's gorgeous. Sometimes it'll switch to side scroller and shooter and it just flows perfectly. The prologue is fairly hard and I did die (and got one of the endings, woohoo) but once you get through it, the desolate, beautiful world opens up and you can explore, upgrade, ride wildlife, and try to figure out what the hell is going on. Overall, I wholeheartedly recommend this game. It looks great, the characters are dynamic and the story is so so intriguing. I can't wait to play more!			"

												I have played this game non-stop since launch, and I had never played any sort of JRPG or Nier game before. After finally completing the game after over 34 hours I can say that this game is truly one that I won't forget any time soon.The gameplay is pretty damn good, I never seemed to get bored of the combat even in the more tedious parts of the game.The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic, and never seems to be boring.The story is pretty good, other than the fact that it starts with the good ol' ""aliens took over the world and humans had to run aaaahh"" type thing.The cutscenes were pretty well done and I must say that some of the story moments absolutely haunted me and made me think.The only issues I encountered were the awkward controls in the 2D scenes, as I suppose they were probably made for console players. The only other issue were occassional frame drops, but this rarely ever happened.This was definitely worth $60.			"

												My rig is:i7-4790K@4.6GhzGTX1070@2.0Ghz16GBI got myself the borderless gaming app which worked like a charm. At the moment I am still playing in the industrial complex area in the first hour of the game, but I have all details cranked up to max playing at 1920x1080 including setting AA to 8x and the game only ever dips below 60FPS by a few frames! Update: I have now progressed beyond the prologue into the city ruins which deliver the same excellent FPS, rarely ever below 60. I also noticed that with AA set to 8x my GPU gets stressed so much that in some areas I end up getting screen artifacts, specifically randomly occuring white orbs - this even appears to happen when my 1070 is not OCed!Otherwise, an excellent game and well optimized! Update: Okay, after reaching the desert zone I did have tiny micro-stutters, but is nothing that would diminish the enjoyment of the overall experience. I am playing with reshade... the first preset which became available, which only sharpens the game a bit and adds more contrast, i.e. boosts the colours a bit... would recommend!

Recommended to play the intro on Normal or Easy, Normal or Hard in the actual game- While the overall graphics are up-to-date, all buildings look the same and objects are not time-matching (year 4000)- 1080p only with Borderless Gaming- Heavy FPS drop during cutscenes, 60 FPS all the way in gameplay			"

												This is by far the best game I have ever played. I have never been so pulled in, so emotionally connected, so... in love with a game in my life. I can just talk about all the reason I like it for days. But I'll list out a pros and cons list.Pros:- Long, well written and driven story mode.   - This game has over 50+ hours of content for those will to go through and look for it. Just finishing the base story takes about 25 hours if you try to do everything. It is well written and never feels like a waste of time, and all of the characters are loveable and add to the story in only ways that improve the overall feel of the story.- Fast paced, fluid Combat System.   - The combat within the game always makes every fight interesting, especially on the higher difficulties. Enemies are predictable up to a point, but then can still manage to cause you some issues by doing the unexpected. As the player though you have many chance to weave in and out of close range combat, and perform a wide variety of strategies to succeed in any fight, regardless of level difference between you and your enemies. - Beautifully Composed and Scored Soundtrack   - This feels like self explanatory statement, but to add to it all of the sngs fit the emotion you should be feeling in the areas that you here them in. The music provides you with all of the extra emotion to properly indulge in the games story and character development process. Cons: - Camera Angles.... rarely but happensThis game feels like what you would get if you paid $60 for a movie ticket to the best experience of your life. It is well worth every penny and I recommended any and all people to try it out. You will not be disappointed.			"

												While it does indeed have a small set of quirks that prevent it from being perfect, it's easily one of the best games I've played in a very long time. I haven't dedicated so much time in such a short amount of time to a single video game since Zelda: Twilight Princess all those years ago.Tight controls save for an occasional hiccup here or there, an interesting plot that kept me engaged, decent plot twist (not something that blows away, but instead gives a sense of melancholy), unbelievable OST, interesting characters and main characters with depth, and a main story length that doesn't overstay its welcome. It's hard to write a review that does this game justice, so all I can really do is urge a reader who's teetering on whether or not to puchase it...to purchase it.  I think Jim Sterling said it best: [www.thejimquisition.com]  ""Nier: Automata is a piece of art that could only effectively exist as a videogame. ... If history forgets this game, then f*** history.""			"

												Update:Managed to find access points and camps where save becomes enabled, after another hour of gameplay from start. I admit that I'm not super great at games, but one hour without any way to save your progress just isn't friendly to beginners. Hope the developer can add more save points, especially in the begining (overall I'm still not a fan of restricting save for single-player games).Changing my recommendation as now I finally get a chance to explore the game. Love the fast-paced actions. Visuals aren't as spetacular as Witcher 3, but still quite enjoyable.Seriously, you can't save?!!

												After 5 hours I already feel like I have gotten my moneys worth and I've only just started.  I don't really write reviews but this game hit a bunch of boxes for me.- The combat is very remenicent of DMC or Beyonetta but so far I am liking it much more. It feels very fluid and responsive and you have lots of ways to change it up even at the start.- The graphics are beautiful, it runs really well on my 1070 which I understand is a higher end card but my set up is only about $1400 CDN so nothing special. I love the visuals and the character animations while fighting- The story so far has me sucked in, I love the world and characters and their dialogue is great so far. I wish every single line from every one off NPC was voice acted but I'm going to be reading everything and talking to everyone.I will update this review if I feel there is more to add but right now I don't see how this could turn into a negative review.

												FIX FOR CRASHES / LAGOn laptops with multiple Graphics Cards ensure the stronger one is set to default, for some reason Nier was using my intel default one instead of my Nvidia.Game runs beautifully now and reminds me so much of Kingdom Hearts hack and slash, really impressed.Old Review:Running an Intel(R) Core i7 - 5700 HQ CPU @ 2.70, 16Gb RAM with a bloody 970x on my PC. Drivers are all updated (tried as fix for game) and the game is unplayable at the moment due to unrelentlingly slow frame rate.It took 20 minutes to get past the intro flight scene due to the settings which I tried on High, Medium, and Low with no result. The flight scene was atleast completable with serious desync of voices to game, and once on the first hand to hand combat it became completely unplayable.As a side note I preloaded the night prior and the unpacking of the game took 3x as long as the download did which is odd. I have a 15Mps internet speedWill check back in a few days to see if a patch is put out but as of now I can not recommend.			"

												Large open world and high action combat makes for a good blend for action fans and the types who enjoy exploring. Game runs reasonably well even when using a GTX 760 for those worried about performance. The action combat is quite unforgiving, even on normal. But thats a good thing. Its not overly difficult (unless you play on hardest setting), the bad guys have visual and audio queues for attacks meaning with good timing you can get away without geting touched. However, failing to dodge an attack can leave you chugging health restores even vs the most basic of baddie.As my first venture into the series, I'm quite happy with how this game was designed. The plot needs a little bit of fine tuning, but flows reasonably well.All in all, solid game. 7/10			"

												I recommend the game, though maybe not the port. You'd think that a game DESIGNED FOR THE PS4 would recognize the PS4 controller's input, but it doesn't. Being that I don't own an xinput controller, I now have to either play on keyboard or deal with the latency of using a program that disguises my PS4 controller as xinput. Also, what self-respecting PC game doesn't have borderless window mode in 2017?Greivances of the port aside, the game is fantastic. Just get it on PS4 if you own one.			"

												Wasn't a fan of the camera movement, no smooth mouse option. Looked online and couldn't find anything. I'm sure they'll fix it or someone will find a way to fix it. Until then it'll go back to my wish list. The story seemed interesting (for as much as I played) but the gameplay would have been greatly improved with a smooth camera. Made me feel like I was playing on console.I did have fun, but again the camera ruined it ""for me"" but it might not for you.			"

												After nearly 21 hours dedicated to playing the game, I can say that without a doubt NieR: Automata is a game that will captivate players that are fans of stories, combat and world exploration. A little bit overpriced but I asure you that once you jump in everything else fades away. The story takes place in a desolate version of earth where war left heavy scars on it. The two things that stand out the most in the game are soundtrack and combat. The music is amazing in this game, sadly the game has no ""jukebox"" option where I can just hear the songs during boss battles. It always fits the atmosphere and helps one connect with the world and characters. I was exploring and revisiting areas just for the songs and almost nothing else.The combat is fast paced, fluid and will satasfy most of your needs to look awesome in a fight. You can collect beautifuly crafted weapons to decimate enemies and chain together in impressive and acrobatic combo moves. Boss fights are tough, but the fights are simply amazing and backed up by the music I always felt a little bad about the fight ending. There are a few downsides to the game. Namely a few bugs that stepped on my toes.- The game sometimes will switch to windowed mode and you have to manually set it back again. This happens if you use the ""Windows"" key or your screen goes dark if you AFK for too long.- During combat when enemies are stunned and vulnerable you can perform a special action by pressing ""E"". B2 will do a combo move but it sometimes doesn't work since the target either breaks out of the stunned state or slides into another direction. B2 ends up hitting an invisible target in that case.- 9S will almost always get in your way. Yes, he is immortal so he's a good punching bag. He even gains the same weapon status and skills you have making him even stronger. But he will invade your personal space 99% of the time and either shove into you, block you from moving or running and lastly screw up your jumps.- Depending on the combat behaviour for 9S, he will sometimes not fight. He will attack a target if you engage it in melee or just follow you if you don't want to fight. But in some instances where he has to stay ""Ranged"" he won't do anything except watch or run around after you. - You can get a game over at any given moment. Not exactly a bad thing, this is my fault for not saving and being too curious and stupid. But yes if you do not save at all and made a lot of progress then did a stupid decision in a quest you can get a game over and start over or load a last save.- The camera will sometimes screw you over. During a fight the camera isn't locked on the character's backside and lets you run around and manually rotate the camera. The keyboard adapts the controls to the angle of the camera and sometimes this results in poor responses. Like unresponsive dodges that will only make B2 stutter in place instead of dashing.- The game could use some more ballance for its graphics. Not take me wrong the graphics are beautiful in this game, sadly their are a little rough and not fully pollished and you'll have to work around the settings to get that much desired shine to it (since 80% of the world's players are into the game for looks only and get bragging rights for their rigs). The game doesn't fully support 4K and is locked at 60 fps. You can get some better performance by disabling AA and VSync (that are maxed out by default) Besides these flaws the game is amazing and the best part is that it has multiple endings depending on what you decided to do during the main mission and the best part is that you can carry out your gear into a new gameplay if you want.

												New to the series. I haven't got into it a great deal but everything i have played thus far is really quite promising..The graphics are surreal and just beautiful, although i have encountered some frame drops via cutscenes which is for me a non factor (Running on a Gigabyte Laptop with single GTX980M) it is really not a problem for me (yet)The controls are really well optimized for me and no issues present with button mapping which is customizable in game ( I am using a wireless Xbox One Controller via receiver for the game).The story seems very interesting and promising and the Music is just so Fricking amazing and atmospheric!  Also 2B's knickers frequently flying in your face is always a +++ factor and oh so very.... yes yes you get the picture pervert. Overall i strongly advise you to purchase this game as it is really quite something and i have spent similiar money on other games which don't even nearly feel this fresh and very satisfying 10/10. Love the series.			"

												Okay, so I am going to recommend this game, even if it has its problems, im going to tell you them.Right now the fullscreen is messed up, when I make it 1980x1080 its not really that and i have a 1080p screen.also, the game is a bit unoptimized.I have an gtx 960, i5 3000 something, and i can run this game okay on medium settings and the resolution 1768x992. sometimes the game loses some frames, and i have no problems with that.if you really want 60 fps tho, use the resolution the ps4 have, wich is 1600x900, make the settings to medium, and most of the time its smooth, the only places u will lose frames are in the open areas, espacially the grass, look out for that lol.although im a little sad i cant run the game in the settings i want because of my pc being to bad or the bad port, it dosent really matter to ME, I can run the game as if it where on the ps4, and that i am happy with, cuz i really wanted that valve pre order thing haha.but if you dont want the problems the pc have you might have to wait, they might not even fix it.i do recommend that IF you have a ps4 pro, get it on that instead, or if you have reaaaaly beffy computer get it on here.

												This has been my first JRPG ever, and let me tell you, so far it has been an amazing game to open me up to the world of JRPGs and RPGs alike. In my first 8 hours of playthrough (which will probably be higher by the time you read this), I have experienced a challenge that actually punishes you for dying, fair and interesting progression, two unique and fun mini-boss battles, and an intense boss battle that required you to understand the mechanics fully to defeat the boss successfully.Pros:- Graphics: The graphics for me have been stunning and smooth. I have the game set at 1920x1080p with max texture settings (Nvidia 970) and have been experiencing almost no lag or frame drops. The closest I've come to lag/frame drops is when I teleport to another location and just load in, although the frame rate almost immediately fixes itself.- Story: The story in this game despite having a slightly cliche intro turns out to be intricate and unique in many ways. The general background of the story is that aliens have attacked Earth with their robots they've created, and the few humans who have survived fled to the Moon to begin the Resistance and YoRHa Android Infantry. You as 2B, the main character, are an android soldier in YoRHa whose been tasked with tough missions against the robots on Earth. From then on you learn all the twists and turns the game's story has to offer, and what has just begun to happen down on Earth.- Gameplay: The fighting/combat system was created by Platinum Games, and as I've seen and been told by others, there's no doubt that it's fantastic. And experiencing it for myself, I can safely come to the conclusion that those people are right. Nothing in the combat system felt clunky, there are not a ton of attacks and combos available which I personally prefer (having to learn and master 30+ attack pattterns/combos isn't that appealling to me), and the attack patterns/combos the combat system does have are well designed and very easy to pick up.- Music: As a gamer, music is something that I listen closely for. Nier Automata's soundtrack has been fantastic so far, with intense tracks for heated battles, calm and casual tracks for neutral/allied areas, and cheerful and upbeat tunes for the happier places in the world. This soundtrack has been so good so far that I have already listened to and fell asleep to it. Not sure if they've made the soundtrack purchasable yet, but if or once they release it I will most definitely instabuy it.Cons:- Choices: So far in my playthrough of Nier Automata, I have been faced with little to no choices I can make that affect what happens and what plays out in the game. Maybe I haven't gotten far enough yet to need to make important choices, but there are a few things that I would have liked to do or chosen to do different throughout the story so far. But if you expect a wide variety of choices or multiple choices you can make that affect the game, this game might not be the best for that.- Weapon Variety: I have come across a few choices of weapons so far, that look different and play slightly different, but none of them have been better than my upgraded original one yet. This may just be a problem on my end because I may need to get farther or explore some more, but otherwise I have no reason to buy a replacement weapon from the weapon shop at the Resistance Camp (one of the main places you head to often)Aside from that, there's really nothing else I can think of that needs improvement. The game is very polished and enjoyable in my opinion, and from the negative things I've seen people saying about this game, it's more than likely an issue with their hardware and graphics settings rather than the game's ""poor PC port."" Because I haven't had a single issue regarding the graphics on my end.			"

While it generally wasn't unplayable (45 to 60 fps), sudden fps drops occured and the 30fps cinematics stuttered heavily.This is just an example of another bad PC port of a Square published game. Unfortunately I can not recommend Nier Automata right now, solely because of these widely reported performance issues.

 Boring game. I would give this game a 1/10 honeslty.  The story from what i've saw is dry.  The combat and controls suck.The drone that follows you around just makes combat so much worse by making shooting and running away from enemies extremely simple and efficeinet.  Enemy types are boring.The voice actors for the characters sound even more bored than I was.  The dialog sounds like it was made from a five year old after watching his favorite anime. The combat in the flying jet things is absolutely the worst thing in this game.  It was just awful and unfun and I hope to never deal with anything like it again.No saving at most points so if you die or quit you have to redo an entire level.  Game cost $60 when I would have a hard time paying $15 for it.  The only positive I can think of is the game looks pretty.			"

												First off, I came into this not playing any of the previous games and just based off of the trailer/screenshots and thought what the heck. Holy. ♥♥♥♥ing. ♥♥♥♥. This is probably the most fun I've had with a game since the release of Skyrim, GTA and possibly even Rocket League (I know the genres are different; speaking on fun factor here). I've never played a game quite like. It's got some of everything, from arcade-like combat, to a twin stick shooter, to a hacking mini-game, to Dark Souls ""holy ♥♥♥♥ wtf"" style bosses. Exploration is encouraged and rewarded with side-quests. The humor in the game is just right. Too many times I've played games in which developers ""over-did"" humor, making it seem like some sort of B-movie.Pros: Diverse Gameplay Beautiful Graphics/Scenery 2Booty Fun Combat Mechanics Interesting Story; a lot of ""what is life"" sprinkled throughout Soundtrack is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing Voice acting is good Amazing game atmosphere/settingCons: Some grahics issues on certain hardware. I've not personally had any issues other than a framerate dip.  60fps cap. Not a gamebreaker for me even though I'd like higher Sometimes 9S can get in the way when you're picking stuff up. For the 1000th time I don't want to change your combat style, 9S.All in all I'd give this game a 9/10. It's definitely worth the money in my opinion. And this is coming from someone that does often play Hack n' Slash RPG's. I'm sure you'll find this to be your ""new favorite game"" in your steam library. I couldn't put it down the day I bought it.

												1080p does not work in fullscreen.For some reason is the name ""Ferazu"" banned.The game could have been a bit better optimised (although turning off AA did actually help a lot).Don't forget to turn off other monitors (if you got multi-monitors). I play at 1920x1080 with everything maxed and AA turned off. I have solid 60 FPS most of the time (with some dips to 53-55 when fighting bigger bosses in larger areas).Also there seems to be small lag spikes when loading into new areas in bigger zones (might be due to me having the game on my old HDD and not on my SSD).I play with the xbox 360 controller and it's perfectly fine. I havent tried mouse and keyboard yet but there seems to be issues with the twin-stick aiming, or so I have heard.My specs are following:I5 2500K OC @4.5GhzAMD Radeon R9 290x 4GB8GB DDR3Old ♥♥♥ HDDWindows 10z77 ASUS motherboardBesides the issues above, the game is easily the best I have played in a looong time.Fluid animations and combat, immersive story and amazing soundtrack.I have downloaded Borderless gaming and with that I can play the game on borderless windowed mode (which solves the 1080p problem).Hopefully a patch gets released next week which solves the issues above.

Enemy types are boring.The voice actors for the characters sound even more bored than I was.  The dialog sounds like it was made from a five year old after watching his favorite anime. The combat in the flying jet things is absolutely the worst thing in this game.  It was just awful and unfun and I hope to never deal with anything like it again.No saving at most points so if you die or quit you have to redo an entire level.  Game cost $60 when I would have a hard time paying $15 for it.  The only positive I can think of is the game looks pretty.			"

												The only reason I am reccomending this game is because the gameplay impresses me from what I have seen so far. The combat feels fluid and the animations are godly. The graphics are also quite good from what I have seen so far. I will say however, that if you have a GTX 780ti graphics card,  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW!!!  The game crashes after playing through the first flight section and about 5 minutes into the actual game. The hour and change I have on this game is due to me trying to get past the prologue without crashing. Unfortunately I failed in all of these attempts. With the massive amounts of issues I have read both on reddit and in the game discussions. I can safely say that this PC port leaves a hell of a lot to be desired. I urge you all to read up on the issues of this game (reddit/nier/ has a gigantic megathread detailing the issues) before you buy this game, just so you can be sure that you can run it.			"

												This is honestly one of the best games I've ever played. It's so well done, so well rounded, and constantly surprises me. You know those games where you think you're going to be clever, and the game calls you out on it? This is one of those games in the best possible way. It draws you into the world so hard, and it's filled with little mechanics and concepts that feel familiar from other games, but that are executed here exceedingly well. The combat in the game feels like Bayonetta, it pulls some familiar death mechanics from Dark Souls (seeing where other players died, collecting parts from your own previous bodies). The overall feel of the game reminds me so much of Phantasy Star Online, from the operators in a space-base communicating with explorers and soldiers on the ground trying to claim a dangerous planet for human settlement. Some of the massive bosses remind me of Shadow of the Colossus, and I'm sure there's dozens of other small, interesting ideas they've picked up from various other sources to refine and create a game that all my friends are honestly sick of me gushing about constantly. Buy this game, play through it- There are like 26 endings because the creators are literally insane. I cannot even put into words how much I love this game.			"

												*--POTENTIAL SPOILERS!!!--* (maybe small bits)I just finished my first run, and WOW, I haven't had an experience like this in a while.I'm not sure where to start so i'll just list my favorite thing about this game.The Story: I like the dystopia overrun by machines who left by an alien race that died off years ago, what made it especailly interesting was learning the differences in machines between areas, how they ""lived"" their lives. Not to mention the relationship 2B and 9S had, it was nice to see 2B progressively warm up to ""nines"".The Ending(s): I only have the A H W on my endings ( for those who dont know, neither do i), but the replayablity of this game is interesting and im really hoping its not the exact same story repeated, though I dont see that happeningThe Music: ...Byoutiful...The SKILLS: very well done I must admit. It has a Dark souls vibe to it aswell, where death means losing your upgrades and having to back track for them, or lose them which by the way not recommended. They can get expensive when you get in the higher tiers.That was most of the good... Now the BAD (Keep in mind this is on the experience of one playthrough)The camera angles: omg, i wish this wasnt an issue, but having to get use to a new camera angle whenever the game decides its time for TOP DOWN/3D-2D/THIRD PERSON/ETC is really obnoxious. I had moments where I kept taking damage from enemies i couldn't see because the camera forced a perspective on me and i couldn't adjust it properly.Length: I uderstand the replay mechanics, but it still seemed too short. I may, however, change my mind after a couple more replays.Weapons: so far theres not much in weapons that interested me. I ran with my entry katana and beastlord (can literally get it at the beginning of the game) the whole playthrough because no other weapons base damage where better.Traveling: the fast travel comes a little late in the game, not too late though. You had two options, Run or take the time to bait a beast and ride it. I would've much perfered an actual vehicle, like a hoverbike maybe? make it easier to travel through land, because you trip on every bush, dip and elevated step while sprinting, make worth a lot so you work for it like 20k-30k.All in all I give it a solid 9/10, I feel my dislikes of the game isn't too much to set it off too much. Except the camera. "

												I have never written a review before, but let me just say that I've never been impressed with a game simply 30minutes in before. It normally takes awhile to get into a game, regardless of what it is. Now, don't mind the 1.8hours playing this, as I've literally only JUST sinked my teeth into this game due to issues that I had with this. I'm not a frame junkie, so framerates don't bother me much, however, I couldn't actually play the game. The last hour was spent trying to get this game running and I finally did! Those of you who have the same system specs as me (as I will list), I'll give you the required information to properly run this game smoothly (though cutscenes will be cut in half):System Specs:Intel(R) Core(TM) I7-6700HQ CPU @ 2.60Hz x2 16GB RamNvidida GTX 960MNow, for whatever reason, if you're having terrible drop rates check to see if the game is automatically selecting your integrated graphics card. My system was automatically selecting it, making the game run super choppy and practically unplayable. Here's how to fix it:1. Right Click on Desktop2. Select nVidia Control Panel3. In left panel select ""Manage 3D Settings""4. In right panel select Globalicon1.png Tab5. Under ""Preferred Graphicsicon1.png Processor"" select ""Auto-Select"" and hit APPLY buttonNow try again and see if it properly selects correct GPU. If not6. Repeat steps 1 thru 3 above7. In right panel select ""Program Settings"" tab8. Under section 1., check the box for ""only programs on this computericon1.png""9. then hit the ""Add"" button and find the program that you want to run on nVidia card10 Go down to section 2. and select nVidia processorCredit to this site: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/583807/my-computer-wont-use-my-nvidia-graphics-card/For those of you who are more frame/graphic junkies that want better frames and run this game with higher graphics and an actual borderless fullscreen, follow the instructions on this site: http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=1353278Currently, the best specs to run this game on for a smooth gameplay experience with little to low issues (in the game setting itself) is: Ambient Occlusion - OffAnti-ailiasing - offDisplay Mode - Full screenEffect  -lowResolution - 1360x768Shadows - LowTexture Filter - offHaving been on the verge of refunding this game, I did some research and found great progress. Now I can play this game and enjoy it! I stopped at my first save point to help you guys out. Hope this helps!			"

												Very good work, as always, from Platinum.  This game has a lot of appeal for people that like tough action games (took me about 4 hours to beat the intro stage on Hard mode, Very Hard is for mutants) and for those who prefer RPG exploration and story (Normal mode on down is much easier).  I haven't played all the way through the story yet, but there are plenty of sidequests, lots of characters, and apparently about 23 endings to find (I got well aquainted with the ""W"" ending).If you like action games, buy it, if you like JRPGs, buy it.  If you like both, buy it now.			"

												Typing this a few hours after release.PC Specs:Intel Core i7 4790K3071MB NVIDIA GeForce GTX 780 Ti16.0GB DDR3Also running the game from an SSD.Incredibly bad FPS even on lowest settings and small resolution (1600x900) and also repeated crashes. Have tried windowed and fullscreen, VSync on/off, nothing made made any difference. Cannot recommend in its current state, really quite awful. Though for some people it seems to work fine so... who knows.Edit: It seems 780 Ti users specifcally are having the worst issues. I've managed to make it playable by doing 2 tweaks:Go into Nvidia Control Panel > Manage 3d settings > and set 'Power management mode' to 'Prefer maximum performance'.Second, run the game and open Task Manager and set the game's Priority to High.These tweaks have let me play the game at 1280x720 on lowest settings without (many) crashes and a smooth frame rate.As a side note, the game fkn rocks.Edit 2 - After finishing the game:Don't care if it runs like complete garbage and still crashes sometimes for me, it's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ masterpiece. I think this may be my favourite game ever.			"

												First things first. IF you have a PS4, then 100% get it there! I'll just make a quick list for people to read quickly.PROS: Good Graphics! Awesome Story! Addictive Gameplay! Great Game All Around!CONS: Bad Port All Together! FPS Locked at 60 Cutscenes FPS Locked at 30 Random And Sometimes Constant Stuttering  Random Pop Up Textures / World. (Yes, buildings can pop up out of nowhere and lag your game) After you IGNORE the fact that your game is stuttering (Which can be hard), it's a really fun game that I  can recommend all the way, but that may get in the way for some people. More so with people with motion sickness or just people who can't play games below 60 because it bothers them that much.

 Notes: Luckily, I wasn't affected by the current issues that many PC players have been having with the game like the internal resolution bug w/ fullscreen. Performance wise is pretty solid for me as I was able to keep up with 60FPS during gameplay. In general, I was able to focus on the game itself. In addition, I am unfamiliar with Nier's lore so in short this is my first Nier title. Intro: With that said, the game made a big first impression as it just jumps you right in. For some that may be challenging, personally I thought it was great as it didn't hold your hand right from the start. Hell, not even 10min and you get your first boss fight. Combat: It's Platinum Games, the same developers of Metal Gear Rising and Bayonetta. If you're familiar with those titles, then you would feel right at home. Easy to pick up but can be hard to master. The game rewards you for well timed dodges and counter attacks. At first you may think it's convulated and clunky, however I can say for certain that the combat is smooth and fast. There also many segments of bullet hell where enemies would just barrage you with constant fire. If it's still difficult, there is an option for auto mode where the game literally plays for you, although I do not recommend it. Music: SWEET MOTHER OF JESUS, where to begin? In short, the soundtrack is good. Like VERY good. It represents a both eerie and sad tone that overall produces a very beautiful composition. During the introduction, it pounds you with epic battle music that can make your heart race with excitement. During exploration, it plays a very smooth tones with excellent vocals. There were times where I stopped just to listen to the music. Controls: With these types of games, I usually play with a controller and I highly recommend it. Keyboard and mouse can be reconfigured. Won't get into detail as it is straight forward. Story: I am not very far into the story as of yet so I can't provide the details but I am liking what I see so far. From what I've heard the game contains 26 endings. 21 of which are just a joke. The other 5 are the real endings which can be obtained from multiple playthroughs. The 5 ending are dictated in routes that your actions can influence the game's ending. Each routes represents a different ending. In other words, having patience by playing the game multiple times can earn you a complete story. Conclusion: It's a VERY good game, but it is plagued by many issues on the PC version. I would highly suggest to wait until patches roll through so that the game's current issues won't hinder your overall experience. If you're willing to risk with dealing the issues then I would recommend a purchase. "

												Neir: Automata still suffers from some pretty bad Optimization issues. FPS drops down to 15-20 is very common in the most mundane of areas that should have no problems running at 60 fps. That being said, the game is still very fun and offers a very unique style of gameplay. while playing it will switch from a third person view to a 2D side scroller, to a Top Down Shooter fairly seamlessly. This does however mean that the KB+M controls are absoluete garbage. If you play this game you will need a controller. This is a pretty bad port, but the game is still fun. the best way to describe it would be to look at Dark Souls. The game desparately needs to have some serious work done, as I dont believe it was completely finished upon release, however it is playable and it is a very interesting and fun game from what I've played so far			"

												Beat this game on PS4 with all endings and almost 100% at 50+ hours and counting. Just gonna put some random thoughts and criticisms but I'll be honest and say that this has become one of my favorite games of all time coming from someone who never played a Yoko Taro game before this one. I fell in love with this game so hard that I had to buy it on steam while I was still halfway through it on my PS4 and just preordered the soundtrack.Addictive and versatile combat that can be dramatically changed depending on your plugin chip loadout and weapon sets. It may seem cheesy by spamming ranged attacks if you're playing on a higher difficulty to avoid getting two shotted. It's very important to customize your plugin chip loadouts early on and continue to see what works and what you like and don't like. Gameplay and story elements are intertwined in clever ways, e.g. individual characters' aptitude for combat are reflected in their playstyles and abilities.Beautfil music score all throughout. Seriously.Graphics are okay, environment isn't as interactive as I had hoped. The game is semi-open world which I somewhat preferred since all the recent open world games are starting to drain me. At first I thought some of the environments were somewhat bland and devoid of color but I'll just say that they each have their own charm and grew to be comfy for me.IMO one of the best video game endings of all time (true ending), the game started pretty strong and held itself throughout and ended so strong.Plenty of twists and emotional points in the story, some may seem insignificant or poorly executed at first glance but there is depth and subtlety in the details that may require a 2nd playthrough or at least scene and dialogue investigation to fully appreciate. I had to read up and watch some videos on Nier and Drakengard before playing to get a sliver of the appreciation that people who played through those games would have gotten from this game. The game as a whole is simply amazing even with its faults, I'm in love. "

												first off, there are some bugs with resolution, and I would DEFINITELY recommend a controller for this game, certainly if you want to play the higher difficulty levels where target lock-on is disabled, but all in all, the game plays great, sure every now and then you might get your ""imersion(?)"" broken but tiny little things(9S follower Ai gets stuck on doors some times, 2B's skirt glitching a little when you lie down). but the combat is solid and considering that's what the majority of this game centres around I think I greatly over shadows the little things you could nit-pick.

												This is a true master piece! The world feels alive, great dialogue and graphics are phenomenal.The weapons are fun to use, lots of combos to pull off. Different levels of challenge if you so choose so. Voiced in Japanese and English. Accompanied by 9S (which is a pleasure to listen to his dialogue)throughout your adventures along with the pods. Game seems very well optimized for the PC, I do get some low frames during very populated bot areas and during certain cut-scenes, but for the most part I'm pleased with the frame rates. The way the game forces the camera into top down, side view(shoot-'em up arcade game) is a welcoming fresh experience in a fully 3rd person RPG.  Not to mention the use of the pod being your personal infinite projectile shooter is awesome! Including the fact that 2B(your character) has no limit/stamina so you can potentially sprint/dodge for as long as you want.It's easy to see that the developers had alot of fun creating this game and pulled out all the stops to make this game a 10/10. Best to give this game a shot, I'm very content with this purchase.I can see myself completing this game.			"

												This game is a ♥♥♥♥♥, no question about it. It starts off easy but quickly shows off its true colors and kicks your ♥♥♥ every chanse it gets. So should you buy it? Duhhh Peoblems- dosent want to render in 1080p while in full screen mode, it looks like it got stuck at 720p and said duck it. The fix for this problem is running it in windowed mode.Another issue, the game is poorly optimized. So if you are under the minimum specs avoid unless you like runing games at 200p. Pro- if the other reviews are 2b believed, dat asssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss. But I think they missed the wonderfull combat, you can fight robots with your bair hands and when you jump in the air and hold down the heavy attack(while using bare hands) you get a better picture of what makes this game truly awsome.

												The port is kinda bad, and this isn't the most beautiful game around, but god damn. It's so good....That's not really enough to go by, so let's elaborate a bit. People have been going on about this being a Platinum game, but just hearing that will give sorta false expectations.This isn't pure action game like Bayonetta, or Metal Gear Rising. This is JRPG with leveling, with combat being pretty nice stylish action. The game doesn't go through individual stages, instead you have world that you travel in, optional and revisitable locations.A lot can be said about setting and the story, but it's best kept short. The game will surprise you, and you'll be going through roller-coaster of emotions. This is truly fantastic stuff, all aided by great soundtrack.So, what didn't I like? Some of the quests are kind of pain in the ♥♥♥, and getting some upgrade materials was pretty grindy, but none of that is mandatory.Given how absolutely diverse the game is, I'm not sure what kind of genre you could sell it as easily. But if you enjoy games, this is totally worth playing.			"

												In honor of ending E, I'm writing a new review.After launch, this game consumed my life for a few days.  I loved every minute of it, and I didn't want it to end.  And yet...  Nier:Automata's entire story is built on the inevitability of conclusions.  The inevitability of death.  All things must come to an end, and Nier:Automata ended as well.Something about this game wouldn't let me put it down until I had finished it, but now I can hardly bring myself to start it up again, even for that sweet 100% achievement.  Not because it's going to take additional time and effort, but because it was inevitable.  I played Nier:Automata.  I loved Nier:Automata.  It will forever remain a precious memory of mine, and that's all it needs to be. (for now, at least)There is so much more to this game than meets the eye, and there's already plenty for the eye (beyond how nice 2B looks, but definitely also that).  I urge all of you to see it through to the final conclusion.  Feel that final moment of uncertainty, that hesitation as your hand hovers over that single acknowledgement...  ""Are you truly-TRULY-sure about this?""""Yes.""And so, Nier:Automata ended for me in the most beautiful way I could ever imagine.  Not with a grand spectacle, but with the gentle closing of a door.  A door which I'll open just a crack, to look through and smile at what I left behind.			"

												This feels 100% like a game, built from the ground up to BE a game. This doesn't feel like a ""product"", which is something that is sadly becoming harder and harder to say with every passing day. An amazing experience throughout the whole thing - the visuals are breathtaking, the combat is smooth and satisfying, the music is stellar, the characters are likeable, and the story is intruiging.You're really passing up a lot if skip over this game. I beat my first playthrough after 20 hours in, but I still haven't even seen half the game's content or story; it requires multiple playthroughs to truly beat the game, and each one is different from the last.My only real gripe with the game is how bad the port is. Without any tweaks or fixes, it screams ""bad console port"". Look around in the Steam guides for details on how to turn this terrible port into a tolerable one.EDIT: AND THEN YOU FINISH THE SECOND PLAYTHROUGH. OH MY GODDDDDEDIT: And then the third one... this honestly might be the best game I've ever played			"

												10/10 easily one of my favorite games of all time+Fascinating and powerful story and characters+Powerful feeling of scope+Artistic and aesthetic character and world design+Great combat system, reminiscent of dark souls and devil may cry+RPG elements are simple and well designed, I especially like the chip upgrade system+A few arcady feeling fights, camera angles and whatnot, touhou style gundam fights too+Didn't expect an open world but it works+Quests are fun and generally varied+dat soundtrack though+Other than the costume (which in my opinion is dope) there's no real fanservice, if you were worried this was panty simulator 2k17 then take solice in knowing that there are no actual panties, it is a leotard.-Lacks a few intricacies that would have made it perfect, difficult to describe, but the world could be more populated with more content. Not a blatant issueThese next few are me really reaching into the bucket for negatives-World design is low rez (The aesthetic is still on point though so I'd hardly call it a complaint)-Tutorial mission is pretty difficult at first and requires a new start piror to the first save. If you die within the first hour of the game you need to start again from scratch, intro cutscene and all. Pretty annoying on the third or fourth time.-Keyboard and mouse controlls aren't great, highly recomend a controllerAlso since it's been noted before, I have not had any problems with the port or subsequent graphics. There's a few annoying bugs but they're few and far between. These include execution moves not working and game crashes (I've encoutered 2 in 15 hours) Running gtx 970, amd i7 4790k and 16gb ram.Overall the atmosphere, gameplay, and story are insurmountable. The very few number of actual issues are overshadowed by the great experience you'll have playing this.			"

Main protaganist look very anime style(and very sexy) which I loveeeeee<3. Boss fights are EPIC and are definitely challenging. What I didn't like: Right after the download completes, there are tons of things you've got to do. For me, the game chose my Intel as the main display system instead of my Nvidia. And there were some graphics problems like the screen was flickering so I had to turn off the Vsync which solved the problem. Full screen = 1600x900 not 1080p but people discovered how to fix this. Well I personally played with 1366x768 simply because my computer was not good enough. Nvidia people had more issues with the graphics than Radeon people. But all and all, all issues are fixable.9/10 , I'd say the money was worth.			"

												So far seems very good, a final fantasy type of RPG with regularly changing combat modes from top down shooter to 'Devil May Cry-esque' to 'Einhander' & 'Starfox'The Good:  Playing for about an hour and a half now, and I've played ""bullet-hell"" style shooting sequences alongside a well put together 3rd-person beat-em-up sequences, the changing perspectives and styles flow pretty well and keep things interesting.  Gameplay looks great at solid 60fps 2K with a GTX 1070, and I'm looking forward to dumping alot of time into this game! The not-so-good:  Many cutscenes stutter pretty badly and cut the framerate to 30fps.  I would prefer unlocked framerates, and some of the nice scenic cutscenes that do play at 60fps are hampered by transluscent black bars at the top and bottom of the screen...I also think the 3rd person 'DMC' mode could pull the camera out a bit, it makes for a kind of claustrophobic battle in some areas, though when the view pulls out for side-scroller and flight I think it's perfect.   Recommend!			"

Since lock on can't be bound to any mouse buttons, you're stuck awkwardly moving your finger back and forth from one of your movement keys to hold down lock on.  Aiming is also a bit finicky, but you should pick up a controller and enjoy this game.  Gameplay is amazing, and it feels very smooth.  This game is not for the faint of heart.  You cannot just save this game any time you want.  There are specifics locations you can do it, which is a key feature of the game.  So SAVE OFTEN.  It will be a very challenging game.  It took me about 2 hours before I could even reach the first save point, but it did take me a bit to get used to the controls.  I would recommend buying this game if you like a challenge, but playing with keyboard and mouse right now is pretty much impossible.			"

												Really awesome game right here.I would go on to tell you how great it is BUT it is blatenly obvious to me that this is a really bad port. It feels and looks like a console game on my rig, which is brand new with a gtx 1070. Therefore i will just skip the detailed review and go into the technichal aspect of the game right away, since i know that that is what really matters here. For me, and for a lot of others alike.The game made a really bad first impression when i realized that you can't play it fullscreen, or i was unable to figure out how. Guess that's a possibility. BUT it should be made so that it is easily played in fullscreen. On top of that, everything was set to either middle or low specs by default. Again, bad first impression. Once in game i notice pop ins and severe problems with shadows on trees. The game does look good, but the pop ins and weird shadows make it really hard to enjoy it. Which sucks since the combat is amazing, but not only the combat. The game made a really good first impression gameplay wise in general. So all in all a great game, but the poor optimization will turn you off if you are easily annoyed by things like that. I hope the devs fix this, the fullscreen issue especially. I will still rate this game positive however. But i will come back to turn it around if i do not see positive change.			"

												A healthy mix of Dark Souls, Touhou, 2D platforming, Top-Down games, RPG and Hack'N'Slash.No problems encountered as far as maxed setting and a PC port go.You will run into 1 problem, not sure why this is so unbalanced but a lot of quests I started had enemies over 2x my level.I.E. Started a robot escort mission at lvl 15, enemies were 35-38. It needs proper scaling. I beat some of them but then go back to main mission which kills some quests having the enemies there be lvl 8 to my 15.Fast travel does not work at the start, which is terrible, got stuck in the deserd where you fight Adam and the only way to leave was to go through a ring of lvl 38 enemies that 1 hit my lvl 14. Absurd. Died 4 times trying to get through and lost a rare heal over time chip.I can see why this got 10/10 and I agree, besides balancing this game is amazing, must have.			"

												This is honestly one of the best games I've ever played. It's so well done, so well rounded, and constantly surprises me. You know those games where you think you're going to be clever, and the game calls you out on it? This is one of those games in the best possible way. It draws you into the world so hard, and it's filled with little mechanics and concepts that feel familiar from other games, but that are executed here exceedingly well. The combat in the game feels like Bayonetta, it pulls some familiar death mechanics from Dark Souls (seeing where other players died, collecting parts from your own previous bodies). The overall feel of the game reminds me so much of Phantasy Star Online, from the operators in a space-base communicating with explorers and soldiers on the ground trying to claim a dangerous planet for human settlement. Some of the massive bosses remind me of Shadow of the Colossus, and I'm sure there's dozens of other small, interesting ideas they've picked up from various other sources to refine and create a game that all my friends are honestly sick of me gushing about constantly. Buy this game, play through it- There are like 26 endings because the creators are literally insane. I cannot even put into words how much I love this game.			"

												Going into this game, I knew nothing about Nier outside of it looking interesting. Now that I am close to finishing my 2nd playthrough I must say that I really like the game. The story CAN be fairly short if you skip side quests, but the game is also meant to be played through a few times. I love how the game implements different playstyles in to one game (bullet hell, side scroller, ect...). Sometimes they feel a bit too forced, but nonetheless end up feeling good and keeping the game interesting and changing.For those who are having fullscreen/windowed issues, there are programs out to help with it, I use something called ""windowedborderlessgaming"" from a WesTech site and it works great for me.

												Very good work, as always, from Platinum.  This game has a lot of appeal for people that like tough action games (took me about 4 hours to beat the intro stage on Hard mode, Very Hard is for mutants) and for those who prefer RPG exploration and story (Normal mode on down is much easier).  I haven't played all the way through the story yet, but there are plenty of sidequests, lots of characters, and apparently about 23 endings to find (I got well aquainted with the ""W"" ending).If you like action games, buy it, if you like JRPGs, buy it.

												♥♥♥♥ me this game is brilliant.On the gameplay front, it's another Platinum Games masterpiece. The Bayonetta and MGR Platinum, not the starfox platinum. The only slight problem I have with the gameplay is 9S, I'd prefer to have heavy attacks for combos than an flash game hacking minigame as a heavy.And story wise, it's Yoko Taro through and through. Deep, relatively complex and very, very intriguing. I only wish it linked more to the original Nier than just the odd reference here and there, though it's still cool to see some returning characters.It's one of the most satisfying games i've ever played, up there with Dark Souls.P.S. Concerning the port, it seems it varies heavily based specifically on your setup. I've heard ""bad fps with high end PC"" and yet I manage to pull a constant 60 on max settings. I never had a single problem with the PC release.			"

												This game is fun and has potential, I've been waiting to play this game for a long time. I didn't want to get a PS4 just for this game, too expensive for me, so PC verison was my choice. But that may have been a mistake, the overall performance is... unfortunately awful. I'm just gonna refund and buy it later when they update the performance and issues (if they care to make any patches). The thing is, my PC is actually decent to play almost any game including MMORPG games. If my PC can run games like Black Desert Online, Titanfall 2, Arma, etc. It SHOULD be able to run this game with no issues. But appearantly most people are receving a lot of the same issues. My only deal is how laggy/choppy the cutscenes look along with the audio is not in sync. And worst of all, the 3rd person gameplay is hella slow, like moving 2B around to hack and slash was in slow motion for some reason. Changing settings barely made any differences. Until they can actually fix these gameplay issues, I'm gonna have to refund incase nothing happens in the future. If you have no problems with the choppy cutscenses and very slow action, then do get it as the game is worth for the characters, story, style of gameplay(like changing camera views), and especailly the music!

												This is mostly a port performance review since I haven't played the game enough to talk about anything else.Specs: Intel i7 6700K | Gigabyte G1 980Ti | 16 GB DDR4 RAMAt this point, I've gotten through the prologue and the first area (forested city) and haven't had any crashes so far. You can select a resolution of up to 4K, although the visuals make it look like an upscale from 900p rather than an actual change in render resolution.The prologue was stupid amounts of fun with a mix of combat scenarios, camera views and a few boss battles. The game managed a constant 60 fps throughout the prologue (except for cinematic cutscenes which seem to be rendered at 720p@30fps). You do very quickly notice the subpar English voice acting though, which you can't change until you quit, except the prologue doesn't save until the end. The music is a bit muted compared to the original, but still trademark Nier and gorgeous to listen to.Things dip a bit during the first mission with more complex scenes including wildlife, settlements, trees and vegetation. I hung somewhere between 45 and 55 fps and in a combat game, you notice the difference. The visuals don't really justify the FPS dips, with rare flashes of color between drab exteriors and sparsely populated areas.I'd still recommend the game based on what combat I've seen so far and what I've heard of the story and all that, but maybe wait if rock-steady performance is important to you.EDIT: With a few more hours under my belt, I can wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of quirky worldbuilding, bonkers characters and drip-fed storytelling.

Not as hard as Dark Souls but the game stops you from spamming one attack button and getting away with it.-Fair. The game has an item (not a spoiler) that automatically recovers your health if you're low.

												Neir: Automata still suffers from some pretty bad Optimization issues. FPS drops down to 15-20 is very common in the most mundane of areas that should have no problems running at 60 fps. That being said, the game is still very fun and offers a very unique style of gameplay. while playing it will switch from a third person view to a 2D side scroller, to a Top Down Shooter fairly seamlessly. This does however mean that the KB+M controls are absoluete garbage. If you play this game you will need a controller. This is a pretty bad port, but the game is still fun. the best way to describe it would be to look at Dark Souls. The game desparately needs to have some serious work done, as I dont believe it was completely finished upon release, however it is playable and it is a very interesting and fun game from what I've played so far			"

												In honor of ending E, I'm writing a new review.After launch, this game consumed my life for a few days.  I loved every minute of it, and I didn't want it to end.  And yet...  Nier:Automata's entire story is built on the inevitability of conclusions.  The inevitability of death.  All things must come to an end, and Nier:Automata ended as well.Something about this game wouldn't let me put it down until I had finished it, but now I can hardly bring myself to start it up again, even for that sweet 100% achievement.  Not because it's going to take additional time and effort, but because it was inevitable.  I played Nier:Automata.  I loved Nier:Automata.  It will forever remain a precious memory of mine, and that's all it needs to be. (for now, at least)There is so much more to this game than meets the eye, and there's already plenty for the eye (beyond how nice 2B looks, but definitely also that).  I urge all of you to see it through to the final conclusion.  Feel that final moment of uncertainty, that hesitation as your hand hovers over that single acknowledgement...  ""Are you truly-TRULY-sure about this?""""Yes.""And so, Nier:Automata ended for me in the most beautiful way I could ever imagine.  Not with a grand spectacle, but with the gentle closing of a door.  A door which I'll open just a crack, to look through and smile at what I left behind.			"

												A Great Game, once you get past all the bugs and ""features"" that come with games that werent developed for PC, but rather ported from console.""Features"" include:- Forced camera angles that dont make much sence. Confusing at first, then irritating. Fighting my first giant enemy was very awkward.....camera tries to focus on the enemy- Cannot camera distance without digging thru menu- There is something broken if you play FullScreen. There are fixes for that.- PreRendered Cutscenes at 30 fps....probably the biggest issue i have with the game. I can look past other negatives. I can wait for fixes. But when a gameplay at 1080p 60fps cuts into something crappy with only 30fps it just kills it for me. I hope devs ?re-render? the cutscenes.There are other things, but these were major for me. Game is designed for the controller, not mouse/keyboard.Now to the Positives, at least for me:- Very engaging, challanging enough, but not too difficult.- I like the story. I have only 12 hours played, but those were 12 hours well spent.- Very pretty. Wish there was a ""freeze"" function and ability to move camera to wherever I want. Environment is Beautiful. - You are actually not completely alone. Pet robot, and pet android, with another pet robot.Word of Caution:If you are coming from Skyrim, Fallout, or Witcher worlds, negatives i descibed above are going to be a MAJOR barrier. It takes time to get used to those controls and camera angles, but once you do get used to them, the game will be a lot more enjoyable			"

												NieR Automata is by far the best game I have played in my life, and for many reasons.I initally got into the series at NieR Gestalt, and went back and played some of the Drakengard games  as well.As much as those games are master pieces in their own right, this game goes far above, and beyond it's predecessors.Simutaniously this game gives many nods to the old games in a way that doesn't impede upon a new players experience.This is a game that stands proudly, and firmly on it's own two Android legs.It is full of highs, and lows, and explores themes of love, hate, anger, consciousness,  life, existence, death, and much more! (It is my wish to avoid spoilers, so I will keep this review as ambiguous as possible.)More mature players that are willing to surrender themselves to this experience will truly appreciate their time with this game.Too easy/hard? Change the difficulty settings!On my first playtrhough on normal I found the difficulty to be very fair.My advice is to go through the story, as much as you can without worrying, or looking too many things up.If you have your own experience with this you will be greatly rewarded in a way that most games won't fulfill you in.Finish it at your own speed, be it fast or slow.I personally favoured a very slow pace, and enjoyed the combat, and scenery as much as I could.It was very easy to do this once I set aside my usual overly efficient mind set, and mentality. This game was well worth the money, just make sure you have a gamepad for the best experience!I will eventually come back to 100 % this game, but for now it has left an after glow that will radiate, and resonate within me for a very long time.Thank you to everyone that was involved in the making of this game, truly! Thank you for allowing it to come to PC, as I wouldn't of gotten to experience it had it not, and after playing this game I can truly say it was an experience worth having.			"

												Highly recommended and possible GOTY contender for 2017Nier:Automata is a really good game that turns into a great game the more time your invested. This title really caught me off guard as I could not stop playing until I got endings A through E which are the required endings to fully understand the game. I havent been this invested in single player story driven game in such a long time that it brought great joy to my heart as I just had to know what was going to happen next.Now the pros of the game+Music is absolutly fantastic and would rate as one of the best video game soundtracks of all time+Sounds are varied and bring life to actions+Engaging and fanstic story that had me hooked +Really good atmosphere+Really good hack and slash combat with top down shooter mix and mash gameplay+Beautiful character animations and unique character design+Great character interactions from funny to heart wrenching+Side quest dont feel like a chore and help with weapon upgrade matierals, no annoying faming (most of the leveling up comes from side quests)Cons-Game looks pretty dated-Top down shooting sections really start to overstay there welcome-F#$k escort side quest only ones I didnt likeIt took me 46 and half hours to get endings A to E which spanned exactly a week of playing from the release date of the game. It is well worth the money, and if your tight on money at least check it out when it goes on sale. Oh be aware of performance issues which theres mod fixes out there for.			"

												I hate single player games. I only bought this because I was extremely bored, and it turned out to be one of my best purchases in awhile.In a few short hours, I've had some of the best boss fights I've ever experienced in any video game. Everything feels larger than life, and 2Bs abilities make me feel like I can take on anything. Really the only negative for me is the amount of running I have to do to get to boss fights, but at least the music is good : ).

												This game is amazing, combat the most.Yet if you want to buy this game it throws you in your first mission, only teaching you the basics, so you will die … a lot. This might actually the worst part of the game, because with every death you end up at the main menu and you need to start all over again; no checkpoints, no autosave nor skippable cut scenes, which can be quite a pain in the ♥♥♥, especially if you planning to play on higher difficulties (haven played below hard, so I can’t tell anything about it). If you can handle this and made it past that point this game is awesome: Good graphics, good story, interesting passive skill system, nice difficulty and fast paced hack n slash combat.

												I'm still making my way through my second playthrough as I attempt to 100% this game. I have to say that I'm really impressed considering I found the original game to be pretty mediocre at best. The combat is excellent. The world is beautiful and memorable. The story is touching. The music is simply magnificent and has been on my daily playlist since release. Just YouTube the OST if you don't believe me. As far as I can tell the game is meant to be played through at least 3 times and you see the world from a different pair of eyes each time. The story unveils even further with every successive playthrough and one playthrough is not all that long. The port itself is decent, but not that great. However, most of my issues with the port were resolved with Kaldaien's FAR mod. It should be on the discussion board for this game.This is a rating from what I've experienced so far. I know I haven't completed this game in its entirety yet. However, I have a feeling that my conclusion won't change much upon completion. In fact, it may just get better. This game is damn good and truly a treasure.			"

												The Westworld of video games. You will like it if you enjoyed Megaman Legends.I enjoy the skill chips customization the most, you can make your characters overpowered. Be sure to buy all memory space upgrades early on.I play the game using the optimal setting that GeForce Experience says, the quality of optimal settings is probably poorer than PS4 Pro quality. Wish they optimized it. It runs at max settings when I put the game on my Solid State Drive (OS) drive.I would like to see more games like this and or the first NieR remade and optimized for PC.I can't get past a certain part of the game because in the hacking minigame my controller or a bug makes the direction of the triangle point in a direction which I do not want it to go and then I get hit and die, over and over again. It is almost as annoying as the last boss in Drakengard 3 which was a rythm game which didn't have a retry immediatly feature you had to load the whole scene and then watch the begining over and over. Or as anoying as in Final Fantasy 15 where the secret dungeon is a platformer reminiscent of the old crappy platformers on PS1, and had nothing to do with the game's main form of gameplay. Wish they had an option to make it a bit easier on people who are having controller problems or is that a bug. There should be some type character customization of the hacker game that makes it easier.			"

												Really good game, I'll just say that even with all the problems, I am still enjoying the game a hell of a lot.But there are problems though.- Crashes, combined with no autosaving this one can be quite a ♥♥♥♥♥.- Resolution seems to be a bit off, not sure what that is about.- Dropped frames during cutscenes. Honestly can't tell if it's my computer or the game that's being weird.- Open world feels very closed off, with a lot of invisible walls. Not too big of an issue, but it makes the world feel a lot more empty. Especially if you're trying to enter a building with a large whole in the wall, and you get blocked by a wall that isn't there.But it really is a lot of fun, story's pretty good too. Bossfights have been a lot of fun so far, but I strongly suggest turning up the difficulty option to hard. Very hard is just silly hard though.			"

												I've never really ever been invested into the plot of games, usually I play games for the gameplay aspect and that alone. I discovered Nier:Automata about a month before its release and followed it closely anicipating the release. When I finally finished the game (make sure you continue playing after the first playthrough) I realized how much I became invested into the story and characters. The gameplay is somewhat smooth, the combat is fluid, the atomosphere and environment are brilliant, and don't even get me started on the soundtrack. This game sucked me into the story really fast and every day I was dying to get home so I can see what happens next. Now I feel an empty void completing the story, but I don't plan to stop playing the game and I can see myself doing another playthrough in the near future. This is definitely my game of the year. If you're anything like me, this game will not disappoint and I 10/10 recommend this game to anyone.P.S. If you have an Xbox or PS controller I would highly recommend using that because for me the KB&M combo is a little wonky, at least for me			"

												Another excellent game by Platinum. Probably one of the best action games I've played in a long long while. On top of that, the story is a cut above the rest. It's a really cool story that throws you plenty of curve balls and gives you something to chew on. There's a whole lot of weapons, skills, and abilities to let you kind of do what you'd want within the game's combat. The game is meant to be played in multiple playthroughs, and from what I've heard there are 26 endings, technically 25 if you don't count the one joke ending (hint: OS Chip).That said, there are a few points where the game kind of drops off. For instance, the game's pacing through the first playthrough is a little weird in that if you stop and do every side quest, you end up a little overleveled for the final quarter of the first playthrough which takes away from the weight of it. Sometimes, the quests get a little tedious to the point where I began to ignore ones that I thought were going to be tedious or bad (E S C O R T M I S S I O N)Overall, I loved this game, and I will continue to love it as I torture myself for those 25 endings.P.S. nice ♥♥♥ tho			"

												One of the most sophisticated, gripping, and philosophical video game stories that I have ever played married to a fast paced and smooth combat system. Despite its lackluster graphics, relatively poor performance compared to graphically demanding games, a few annoying bugs (the fullscreen resolution bug was the only one that I encountered), and mechanically terrible but thematically superb side quests, this is one of the greatest games of all time. This also has one of the greatest sound tracks as well that dynamically changes during game play. If you enjoy 3rd person action games and deep stories, you owe it to yourself to play this game.I should also note that the keyboard and mouse controls are horrendous (eg. mouse control feels like an emulated analog stick). I highly recommend playing this with a controller.			"

												For a game I had 0 knowlage of at all until a friend reccomened it to me. It was phenomenal. Any story driven game that makes me sit down and question what is what is always a must buy for me. The true ending is the greatest ending of any game I've seen in a while. Solid 10/10 for me. 100% worth the cost.Side note a controller is highly recommended.			"

												Driven by a strong and compelling plot, satisfying gameplay, and an unforgetable soundtrack, few games can offer an experience comparable to NieR:Automata. What starts as a decently fun hack and slash game quickly evolves into a gripping rollercoaster of emotions. It should be noted that this is the first game I've played in this series so my opinions will be reflective of that.The Good:- Absolutely amazing story- Strong main cast- Beautiful soundtrack- Satisfying gameplay (combat, progression, gear)- Open world - Side quests that provide more meaning that just ""do this, do that""- Multiple endingsThe Not so Good:- 60 fps cap- Infrequent crashing- Limited/linear gear upgrades- 900p, 30 fps cutscenes make transitions especially jarring- Port is not very well optimized for its technical prowess- Washed out colour palette (subjective)- A few shockingly low resolution textures (i.e. the rusted red crate in the resistance camp)- Hacking becomes repetitve after a whileDespite the existance of a few bugs [which will hopefully be addressed soon] and limitations that hold the game back, the unparalleled experience delivered by NieR:Automata easily outweighs its drawbacks. This is one of the few purchases as of recent that I've felt was worth the full price tag.			"

												Okay wow, on the surface this was an okay game with some fun familiar gameplay mechanics but going a little deeper, this game delivers some pretty heavy story notes that upon first impression appear to be superficial. I'm impressed Mr Yoko Taro and surprised that I've never discovered your games before this one. There are some heavy philosophical/existentialist themes in this game and without saying more it pulled a very heavy ""6th sense"" on me; emotionally it went from okay to extremely sad and melancholic.For anyone wanting to try this game, I can't stress this enough, beating the game once, isn't beating the game at all; it is just a chapter break in the story. They take 'new game+' video game mechanic and completely flip it on expectations.			"

												So far I'm enjoying this game, if you played the first one it hits you hard when you see things reappear that were from the first game, the weapons being the most noticeable I can say without going into spoilers, The combat has gotten much much better compared to the first one, granted it's still small combos but it's much faster and easier to pull off. And the story so far is still just as depressing as ever. and I love it. If you are a fan of the first one or even a fan of Dragkengarud I would say pick this game up.If you are new to this, give it a shot and see if you like it. And if you do maybe look into the lore a bit to understand some of the hints to the first game.			"

												This game is wierd, and I don't mean because of the story or because its Japanese.So I am a big Platinum fan and enjoyed most of their work even from back before they became independant from Capcom. As for Nier and Drakengard, well my knowledge of those games basically comes from watching Clemps' summary, btw hes youtube channel is great, check it out if you need some background on the world of this game.I came into this for the Platinum gameplay experience and on that front I was dissapointed. While this game is deffinately fun to play, due to it's length and lack of variety things gets pretty repetitive quite quickly.Now the story on the other hand while not quite the same tone as most Platinum games, is VERY good. Even if mostly non-sensical it will strike a cord with most gamers on an emotional level. I can now see why Yoko Taro's games have such a cult following.This leaves me very conflicted because I played this game for one thing and ended up enjoying it for another.Do you like sories that resonate on an emotional level (maybe not so much on a logical level)?Are you a fan of Yoko Taro's previous work?You should deffinately play it!If you are looking for 'dat Platinum feel'? Maybe try it out but this game is not quite that.  "

												I haven't bought many games recently at full price on release, especially without proper research, however I took a gamble on this game, and it payed off. This will sit in my library as a classic to come back to once I'm finished with this (whole) playthrough, I'm sure. The story is a bit slow to start, but becomes quite engaging and interesting. The setting looks fantastic, and the gameplay is really varied and interesting. The ground-based combat reminds me a lot of a semi-open world Bayonetta.There are bad points. The port isn't great; I wouldn't play without a controller and I had to use a 3rd party application to run it in a borderless window for proper 1920x1080 resolution (Day 1 release). The game plays fine on high on my i5 4670k, 8GB RAM and 970 GTX though.			"

												I have played this game non-stop since launch, and I had never played any sort of JRPG or Nier game before. After finally completing the game after over 34 hours I can say that this game is truly one that I won't forget any time soon.The gameplay is pretty damn good, I never seemed to get bored of the combat even in the more tedious parts of the game.The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic, and never seems to be boring.The story is pretty good, other than the fact that it starts with the good ol' ""aliens took over the world and humans had to run aaaahh"" type thing.The cutscenes were pretty well done and I must say that some of the story moments absolutely haunted me and made me think.The only issues I encountered were the awkward controls in the 2D scenes, as I suppose they were probably made for console players. The only other issue were occassional frame drops, but this rarely ever happened.This was definitely worth $60.			"

												Can't say anything bad about the game in all honesty. I find the game incredibly beautiful, along with absolutely fantastic music. The world feels mostly big enough, it's not excessively big, but big enough that I can go exploring a bit. I only had one crash - and that was very early in the game, and I've not encountered anything too buggy or what have you, at least yet. Not going to type out a big long review, but if you like fast paced combat, beautiful music and scenery and massive bosses, it's great. And Kudos for the controls on keyboard/mouse feeling excellent (to me) and I love how the game can transition from 3rd person to platformer, to top-down seamlessly at times. No regrets so far.			"

												Let me start off by saying this game looked and seemed like it would play amazing.. until i tried to change my graphics setting. I switched to 1920x1080p and got a white screen. The game is still going, just cant see anything. I went through a few hours of trying to reset the settings, from valve command prompts, re-installing the game multiple times, to actually trying to corrupt the steam cloud and clear it out. Sadly to say none of this worked and i continue to have a game (thats still technically running) that i cant play because of a white screen. Many are having unacceptable issues with this game, and i for one will have to downvote this until they actually try to fix these issues.edit: after taking a few suggestions, i managed to get it working again. game plays great, but id stil like like to hope that i can use the 1080p at a later date. overall good game			"

												first off, there are some bugs with resolution, and I would DEFINITELY recommend a controller for this game, certainly if you want to play the higher difficulty levels where target lock-on is disabled, but all in all, the game plays great, sure every now and then you might get your ""imersion(?)"" broken but tiny little things(9S follower Ai gets stuck on doors some times, 2B's skirt glitching a little when you lie down). but the combat is solid and considering that's what the majority of this game centres around I think I greatly over shadows the little things you could nit-pick.

												After 5 hours I already feel like I have gotten my moneys worth and I've only just started.  I don't really write reviews but this game hit a bunch of boxes for me.- The combat is very remenicent of DMC or Beyonetta but so far I am liking it much more. It feels very fluid and responsive and you have lots of ways to change it up even at the start.- The graphics are beautiful, it runs really well on my 1070 which I understand is a higher end card but my set up is only about $1400 CDN so nothing special. I love the visuals and the character animations while fighting- The story so far has me sucked in, I love the world and characters and their dialogue is great so far. I wish every single line from every one off NPC was voice acted but I'm going to be reading everything and talking to everyone.I will update this review if I feel there is more to add but right now I don't see how this could turn into a negative review.

												I must start to say this game is amazing.When i first started this on high settings and everything on max  in fullscreen everything worked very nice, then i restarted the game to try a few things and suddenly i got micro stutter, but some minor changes discussed nearly everywhere sorted that.Played near 10 hours so far, turning every stone i can find killing most stuff i can see, i really enjoy this game.My specs are win 10, i7 3820, geforce 1060 6gb, 16gb ram, ssd.  running at 1920x1080 at high setting with AA and Vsync off every thing else is maxed, using borderless gaming app. keeps 58-60 fps most of the time, cutscenes that many complains about is running okay some micro stutter hardly noticble for me.Had zero crashes aswell. When this is patched I will really recommend this to everyone but as many know this is a hate or love game.Othervise if u hate fiddle with settings and such, wait a bit untill most is sorted and if u have an older pc say 9xx geforce and older u might wait aswell untill u are sure it will work correct, as for now i wouldnt start this game with a weaker setup.Edit: near 40 hours gameplay, zero crashes and the games is running smooth 99.9% of the time.

												Lurked on steam forever, my first review.  I did not play the original Nier for PS3.Pros:  Immediate story catchup, no cryptic ""what's happening"" in this world filling in the blank, for example as was done with the Metal Gear series.  Most started on MGS1 (that I know) and you had a vague idea who Big Boss was until you played MGS3.  A very well done story yes, but unless you played the two low key NES games you otherwise never heard of it.In game adjustment of difficulty/camera movement.  The camera style can be odd, alternating from a very open sandbox world to a corridor for a very quick alternate from 3d to 2d movement.    The game difficultly flat out tells you for the extreme gamers out there... you die in one hit, and you have one ressurection to get your ""gear"" back.  Con:Personal morality thing, without spoilers you are trying to kill objects that are trying to kill you... but saying things that would soothe crying children or were otherwise heartstring tugging events and I just thought ""I have no soul, I am extremely heartless.TLDR;  Buy it, the $60 is a bargain with the in depth detail given for it.

												Now that I have finished Ending A (the main ending) as well as part of B, I feel I am ready to review this game.I'm going to break up this review into 5 sectionsPlotCharactersControlsGameplayOptimizationPLOT-While some have labeled the plot as cliché (and I can see why), This is the first game in a while that had a story that I actually found myself wanting to continue and push further. It's a very odd tale that, while not as deep, reminds me of MGS. Plot 8/10CHARACTERS-The character design was... interesting. While everyone was gawking at 2B's butt, I was confused as to why they were blindfolded as they can see/operate fine without it. If video game characters are your cup of tea for 'certain viewing times' this game will please you. if not its kind of meh. The dialogue was pretty good, I heard both English and Japanese voice actors, and both settings were good (Japanese was better IMO for obvious reasons). I never thought that the characters were too talkaive, and they never seemed to get on my nerves. Characters 7/10CONTROLS-If you have a controller, use it. While the KB&M controls are not bad per se, they definitely could have been better. While the options do not apear to accept mouse controls for attacks, THEY ARE ALREADY MAPPED. It is very odd and never is noted that you can use your mouse, but that is much better than the alternative(Shift and /). Dodging got repetitve and isn't fun to perform (double tap a movement key). However I saw a mod that fixes this, I may pick it up. CONTROLS 6/10GAMEPLAY-Dear god is this game just an absolute blast to play. The combat is fluid and fun. the animations are incredible. There's tons of stuff to keep you occupied (Reportedly up to 45 hours). The Boss fights are a ton of fun, not being to easy, but not too difficult either. Exploring, Item hunting, side questing, and ...fishing, It's all a ton of fun. GAMEPLAY 10/10OPTIMIZATION-If you haven't heard, the port of this game is nothing to write home about. with an odd 1600x900 res lock, 60 fps lock/30 fps cutscene lock. Multiple people reported a whitescreen game crash after about 10 minutes(I was one of them) but rest assured, there are fixes to almost all of the problems. The Devs are also woking to fix the port up, but there is community mods to make this game more pc friendly. OPTIMIZATION 5/10TL;DR-This game is going to become a classic. This is easily my GOTY so far. Pick this gem up as soon as you can. If you manage to grab this on sale, you might as well be commiting theft. This game will stick with me for a long time, and I will be watching for Platinum's works from now on.OVERALL-9/10 GREAT			"

												A great game hindered by the annoying no safe beginning area and for some pc port issues. Those 2 negatives get far outshined by the greatness of the rest tho! After getting used to the combat (By you guessed it, repeating the no save area) the game becomes incredibly fluid and fun. Dodging around doing combo's, parrying attacks and shooting powerfull lasers it all feels absolutly great. Now i have to say as well the game contains several gameplay modes like normal action mode, twin stick mode, 2d platformer mode and likely many more however i feel like some of them do not work well in the game but nevertheless these are mostly short sections so i can live with them.Audio and visually the game also does a decent job although some of the enviroments are visually lackluster but the soundtracks in every map definetly make up for any issues in that regard. About the story i can't say much yet since i havent finished it at this point. But overall i feel like this game is easily worth a buy.EDIT:Finished the story and i have to say this game really starts to shine when its all coming together at 2/3 of the game. If it wasn't for the enviroments and some repetitive aspects of the game then this game would have truly been a masterpiece.			"

												The combat is exciting and fast-paced, and the variety of weapons keeps it interesting throughout the game. Although if you use the same weapon and never change throughout the entire game, it will start to feel repetitive. Boss battles are massive set-pieces that feel like accomplishments to take down, even when they aren't too difficult, because of their scale. The soundtrack to this game is amazing. Even if you don't play the game, I would recomment at least litening to the ost online. With the gameplay providing a solid backbone, the story, and writing are what elevate this game to something amazing, although multiple playthroughs as different characters are a must if you want to experience the story in its entirety. This game made me feel things I haven't felt in a long time. Each playthrough comes with a different perspective, and more details on the world being brought to light. This is one of few games I would recommend even if you don't like the core gameplay loop, because the story and ost are so good.			"

												if you play through the game once, its a solid a game. If you play through the game twice you unlock an entire second arc to the story. If you play through that second arc it's game of the year easily. If you complete every single ending, it's the greatest game of all time. This game has done more than just been a fun game, it was an experience that challenged me morally and philosophically. It went above and beyond what I expected from not just this game, but games in general. It would be a shame to pass up this one because it is unlike any feeling any other game will give you or any other form of media will give you. 100% a perfect game.Sidenote, if you're having performance problems turn down the shadows first. high vs medium is a 10fps difference.second sidenote, play with a controller for the love of god dont use kb+m			"

												If you like a game with a captivating and unpredictable story, NieR:Automata provides that. Many times have I thought that the game was going to have a predictable and cliche outcome but never have I before been proven wrong this many times that I continue to play over and over again regardless of knowing the story because just when you think the story is over, you replay it to find something new that changes the gameplay.Would rate this game a 10/10 and I highly reccomend it to people with a lot of time on their hands!

												Epic gameplay for the creative players out there who don't just hack and slash. Music is great too.As others have said, this could use a patch for the upscaled 1080p blurry visuals.Workaround is to run the game in windowed mode and use ""Borderless Gaming"" app to make it ""borderless windowed."" This will retain the 1080p visuals and not degrade it. Plays well with Xbox One Controller. I'd buy it if you can deal with the 1080p-upscaled short-coming until a patch comes out (hopefully). "

												Excellent game, but the port leaves much to be desired.NieR: Automata is a strange hybrid of JRPG, platformer, hack n' slash, and twin stick shooter set in a distant dystopian future. It comes with a phenomenal soundtrack, vast multi-biome open world, and satisfying combat system baked in. The boss fights are original, challenging, and often very strange, and the storyline is pretty interesting (if a bit strange).Keep in mind that there are multiple endings: 5 main endings with individual stories, and 26 different possible ways to end the game.My only issues with the game are with its porting. There's a well-known resolution bug that changes your resolution to something lower if you're playing in fullscreen, microstuttering if you're not using VSYNC, 60FPS cap, and several other issues. While they are annoying, they don't completely detract from the gameplay. If/once these issues are fixed, I'll have absolutely no problem with the game.Pros:Wacky but exciting storyFantastic soundtrackPlenty of content/questsSatisfying and fun combat systemVery pretty visualsCons:Multiple technical issues (Resolution bug, microstuttering, white screen on AMD)Wonky camera anglesLimited settings menu (Can't adjust draw distance)Poor keyboard + mouse supportLocked to 60FPS, 30FPS cutscenesThe game runs fine on my system with no crashes, but I've heard of framerate drops/crashing on systems with AMD cards			"

												Probably one of the best Action RPGs I've played in a long time, and it's definitely gonna need a few fixes, but the issues the game has doesn't really detract from the experience.

If you like anime, large action set pieces, or heavy story with great gameplay, you're gonna love this game.			"

Good graphics, gorgeous artstyle, amazing work with colors, absolutely fantastic soundtrack, excellent character development, intriguing story and great pacing plus refined Platinum gameplay make this the best game of 2017.

												This is honestly one of the most memorable games i've played in a long time. The characters create an emontional story while the combat kept me entertained and challenged throughout my 20 hours digging straight through the main story. The best part is i'm still not done and still have more to work towards.I'm afraid that many people will stop playing when they see the credits roll for the first time. Its something I almost did, but i'm thankful I loaded my save again. This game features multiple endings, so keep playing to the very end.The music is astounding, even though i'm not the biggest fan of the vocals. I'm hoping steam will include a OST download at some point...On regards to the PC port, I had no issues with gameplay on my 1080 card. I hope others will get their fixes too. The only issue i had graphically was with the light rays on environments and characters, particularly in the side scroller sections. The glare makes a ugly blur and looks blocky around the character heads.The RPG elements are a nice addition, including weapons and chips that augment stats or give extra combat/ support functions. I can't really say this is a choice-driven game aside from persuing the endings, but its not an issue. Once you've FINISHED the game to the very end, you'll be allowed to backtrack through the story, whilst keeping all progress, levels, chips, and upgrades.Overall its been an outstanding experience and hope to see more games like this.Some cons:-Invisible walls around some buildings, mainly the city.-Not entirely voiced. The main story progression is fully voiced, but most sub-quests and convesations are text.-Permanent loss of chip upgrades if you die again before reaching your body, like how Dark Souls has you loose souls. Upgraded chips can be purchased towards endgame, but there are rare chips with reduced memory usage that would be a pain to loose.-Keyboard/mouse gameplay was difficult for me, particulaly in trying to aim the Pod's fire. Controllers are recommended.			"

												This is one of the best games I've ever played.Yes, the combat and hacking can become a little boring after 20 or so hours and getting 100% is tedius as ever due to Yoko Taro being such a troll looking at you Nier and your flowers. But in the end it's all worth it.This game also have some of the best music and sound design I've ever experienced.I don't recommend starting with new game+ directly after finishing the game once due to it might give you a burnout. Ease into it.But all in all, one of the best games I've ever played, easily top three.In the end the only question I have for you if you beat it, are you willing to give someone else that experience?I did and I don't regret my decision a single moment.

												So far, the combat in this game is awesome. You have little dynamic galaga-like spaceship and mech fighting levels that are fun as hell, and kind of reminiscient of the Gummi ship from Kingdom Hearts II only waaayy better. And then you have the third person sword-play combat (which is 99% of the games combat) which is so beautifully refined and awesome. For abilities you have these chips that take up a certain amount of space and a limited of allocated space to put them in, so you have to decide which power-ups will benefit your playstyle more and its very unique and original. The swordplay has weight and the combat becomes very instinctual and fluid once you get the hang of it. And if you're playing the game on 'hard' it is HARD AS ♥♥♥♥, which is awesome. Only about five hours in and the story is already building tension and mystery. Also, the soundtrack for this game is breathtaking. It reminds me of the original Ghost in the Shell film OST, which is what I think they were going for considering the many similarities between the two. So far, it's one of the best RPG's I've played since The Witcher 3, and the best game released within the past year, and I've only played so little of it. I had to come and leave a review because of this euphoric feeling I have from playing this game. It's truly a work of art.			"

This doesn't however, change the framerate issues w/ cutscenes and hiccups in game performance. HIgher tier graphics cards (97+/10xx) are imperative for any sort of performance boost above what's already present on the PS4 ver. It's def. a faulty console port that could use patch fixes, but that doesn't detract from the game content.			"

												I’d like to start my review with a little story from my short playing session today:***When I play games on my PC I have two options:1) I play them on a 24“ monitor + a rather good speaker system2) I play them on my 40“ TV + a really good surround systemToday I went into a new area in the game while playing on my computer monitor, because I didn‘t want to switch on all that other equipment for a playing session that would only be rather short. End of story: I felt genuine regret! Not that it was a bad experience. Oh no, far from it! It was awe-inspiring. It‘s just that the visual and sound design in this game is ‚that‘ awesome.***Apart from that: The combat is satisfying, the story pulled me in right away and I so far enjoyed every single minute of gameplay!Oh, one more thing: I’m incredibly bad at action games. I usually only play turn-based stuff or very specific types of games that don’t require incredibly good reaction times. I’m so bad that I often have to quit games like this one after about two or three attempted battles. Luckily the lowest difficulty is just right for me, so that I can enjoy this awesome game. In this title boss fights are challenging, but not too difficult for me.You are good at action games and looking for a challenge? There are difficulty levels for everyone in this title.Overall there is no reason not to buy this game right now … except:The port is competent overall, but does have some severe technical problems. The worst of them ARE fixed by applying an unofficial fix (named ""FAR"": see the thread at the top of the forum) and using windowed borderless gaming, but IF you belong to that group of people who absolutely refuse to apply unofficial patches and use 3rd party tools: DO NOT GET THIS GAME NOW, BUT INSTEAD WAIT FOR A PATCH! (Sorry for the caps, but this is seriously important. That’s just how mandatory the fix is until this port gets patched.)I for my part use the fix and the borderless tool and I’m enjoying the hell out of this game.-----EDITS and additions after posting the review:Strictly speaking the game is playable without the fix and 3rd party tool, but usually a combination of the following can happen:- In fullscreen mode the resolution may be off (window mode has borders)- button prompts for the controller can be messed up in fullscreen mode- ingame cutscenes may stutter far below the 30 fps they were rendered in even on very performant hardware- on less potent hardware: without the FAR fix you don't have access to global illumination settings, which impact the performance heavily and the visual fidelity much less than other settings (even on a GTX 970 it may be difficult to maintain a steady 60 FPS in 1080p unless you either disable AA and AO. Toning down global illumination by only one level gives me roughly the same performance benefit that I can gain by entirely disabling both of those features.)			"

Honestly can't tell if it's my computer or the game that's being weird.- Open world feels very closed off, with a lot of invisible walls. Not too big of an issue, but it makes the world feel a lot more empty. Especially if you're trying to enter a building with a large whole in the wall, and you get blocked by a wall that isn't there.But it really is a lot of fun, story's pretty good too. Bossfights have been a lot of fun so far, but I strongly suggest turning up the difficulty option to hard. Very hard is just silly hard though.			"

												The game is very beautiful with such astonishing music to follow.Graphics is on point. Sadly the fullscreen doesn't fully work yet. Hoping SE comes up with a fix with that ASAP.Pros:- Beautiful landscape and music- Music on its on is on another level- combat system 10/10- 2B's ♥♥♥ is good tooCons:- Prerendered videos is played at 30fps.- The fps is locked on 60fps (hopefully this gets fixed soon)- Playing in fullscreen 1080p doesn't set the game to 1080p, gets upscaled.Overall:Just beautiful to play.

												Only an hour in, but it's already scratching an itch that hasn't been seen to since Ninja Gaiden 2. This is exactly the type of insanity that PC gaming has been missing.Update: Okay, so once it gets past the prologue, things change a bit. It blends ninja gaiden, bayonetta and final fantasy with its own esoteric lunacy, and I really dig it. It shouldn't work as well as it does.			"

												Achievement unlocked: ""what are you doing ?""Self-destruction: ActivatedMore seriously tho, I'm not a big fan of japanese games, and it says a lot that I really enjoyed this one, its a wild and insane mix of hack and slash, slidescroller, bullet hell, shoot them up,..... the camera angles will determine the phases you are on, overall, it plays like nothing else and the novelty really is a great driving force in this game, always introducing new mechanics and throwing the player off balance.Graphically, its nothing groundbreaking, but the animations are excelent with few cliping and overall the atmosphere makes up for it, not a big deal, the PC port is meh but future updates will most likely fix it, and there already is a mod that fixes most graphical problems and uncaps framerate, so big deal either.The soundtrack is great and sinc perfectly with the action, lots of great songs, beware, the vocals are weird sometimes tho.The story is told in a very creative way, VERY MINOR SPOILERS (having the player go trough the story multiple times trough multiple characters, adding new mechanics, new quests, new perspectives and new infos allowing you to go deeper in the lore each playtrough) END SPOILERS The game is also an excelent value for money, having me play for 35 hours to complete the main story and roughly 50% of the sidequests.The only negative points IMO is the DENUVO drm which I am oposed by principle because it puts such a great game at risk in the long run and the sometimes samy sidequests in between the great ones.Overall, its a warm recomendation for me, its a japanese game so of course the fan service is strong with this one but there is so much more behind that I can't really complain, GET THIS GAME.

												A truly unique game. As someone who has played a lot of different games throughout his life, playing something this fresh and unique is very uplifting. Far from the rehashes and safe game design models of many other recent games, Nier automata blends a lot of different genres and aspects of games into one both for good and bad, but nevertheless for a very unique experience. Even if a certain blend doesn't work, many of the elements stay only for a short while, so you will quickly move on to the next. This is ontop of a great soundtrack, very entertaining and fun to play around with combat from platinum Games themselves and a crazy yet interesting story.Can recommend for any game enthusiast looking for something new.

												its a great game hampered by a few thingsthings you should know before buying:- you will need a third-party patch or the performance can get really really bad, but the patch is easy to install- you can't save for an hour after you start the game, and if you die in the prologue you will have to start from minute 0otherwise the combat feels really fluid and fun and (for the most part) avoids pressing the same button over and over again that plagues these kinds of games.  the script sometimes goes off the rails and some really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dialogue moments happen but it's a japanese game so that's to be expected; it's still way above average for most jrpgs			"

												Pro: The game itself is awesome. To sum it up: impeccable art direction (incredible graphics and audio, oozing style and atmosphere), the game universe is fascinating, the story is quite good, and the characters are great, you just want to know what's going to happen to them, while enjoying the walk and chases in these derelict cities overrun by vegetation and enemy robots.Con: The quality of the port is debatable: a recent AAA PC game, high-res, from a big name in the game industry, and it runs only in windowed mode? WTF? Square Enix has never been that great in PC computing anyway. But the pros overweigh the cons by a huge factor: you just can't afford to miss this game. I'm an old gamer (not old school: I enjoy what modernity brings us ; I just happen to haven some decades of gaming behind me), I'm a sucker for mature narration and good characters, and I know when I see them, and they're all here, just for us to play.

I'm running the game in windowed mode simply because i'm having issues with black borders/fuzzy resolution with full screen. I get a solid 60fps with no drops, gameplay feels incredibly smooth although cutscenes are still 30fps and are pretty choppy.My biggest irk is the lack of DualShock support, you'd think for a PS4/PC exclusive it'd atleast have that.

												Some issues, overall seems to be a decent conversion (especially considered the typical standard of japanese games ported on PC).I compared it to the PS4 and PS4 Pro version, here's my comments in detail1) Framerate is much more stable than even the PS4 Pro, locked at 60fps. Only saw TWO small drops in the first section of the game, even in areas where some frames would be skipped on the PS4 Pro (lava section underground in the lava factory). Framerate is 30fps for cut-scenes, don't remember if this was the case for PS4/Pro versions too but I assume it was.2) There's no borderless windowed mode. Fullscreen is lost if you alt-tab3) Game doesn't run at real 1080p if you set it that way, but something slightly lower. 900p? Bit higher probably. There's a small black frame if you set fullscreen 1080p4) The additional effects present on the Pro version, are also present on the PC versionGame is still as extraordinaire as the console version, hope they can fix those small annoying issues, but I got no hopes for that. Being that the game runs on DENUVO I'm afraid modders won't be able to fix them either.I tested the game on a GTX 1070 with an intel i7 3770, windows 10			"

												As of right now I'm in the middle of playing through this game and if I remember, I will update my review when I finish the main story. Right now I'm really enjoying Nier. I don't have a good graphics card at all so I thought this game wouldn't run on my machine, I was pleasantly surprised to find I was wrong!If you're like me then you see a cute anime girl and feel inclined to buy (no shame, it was a major reason for my purchase) but to my surprise, 2B isn't the reason why I keep playing this game, it's the beautiful art, music, and battle animations in combination with a wonderful feeling pace of battle!My fair warning is that when it says hard mode, it means it! Anything harder than normal gives an experience reminiscent of a Dark Souls game (maybe even harder) so if you're looking for that challenge, this game is great!

												In its current state I would say don't grab this, grab it on PS4 if you REALLY want itMy main gripe right now is that mouse and keyboard controls are absolute garbage, while I get that you should be using a controller (and I would be, if it were not for my controller going missing into the void literally today) I don't find a PC game that is configured like this to be acceptable.In its current state these are problems I noticed that ended up making me just flatout turn the game off, despite waiting for it since announced.The game randomly ignores keyboard inputsThe game has digital mouse control, it essentially just sees that you recently moved it on X/Y axis and goes 'yo thats fine' meaning you only get 8 directions, some enemies are actually not possible to hit without lockon (which is disabled in harder modes)The game bugs out when camera angles change, you have to let go of all buttons for it to ""reset your inputs"" to the new cardinal directions.Sometimes when dashing it, no matter what, dashes you backwards and locks you in place.Default binds are fairly dumb, the biggest ones being light/heavy attach which are set to / and \ but also hardbound to left/right mouse.The game breaks all capture software permenantly when you change any video settings and requires you restart the game to capture again.The issues with the m+kb controls are bad enough that they seriously detract from the game, if you don't have a controller you should flatout not buy this.

I've found it increasingly harder to find games that can capture my enjoyment and provide me an awe inspiring experience that can take me away from the real world like when I was younger. Nier Automata is one of those rare gems in gaming that brings me back to why I fell in love with the medium in the first place.

												Excellent game, but the port leaves much to be desired.NieR: Automata is a strange hybrid of JRPG, platformer, hack n' slash, and twin stick shooter set in a distant dystopian future. It comes with a phenomenal soundtrack, vast multi-biome open world, and satisfying combat system baked in. The boss fights are original, challenging, and often very strange, and the storyline is pretty interesting (if a bit strange).Keep in mind that there are multiple endings: 5 main endings with individual stories, and 26 different possible ways to end the game.My only issues with the game are with its porting. There's a well-known resolution bug that changes your resolution to something lower if you're playing in fullscreen, microstuttering if you're not using VSYNC, 60FPS cap, and several other issues. While they are annoying, they don't completely detract from the gameplay. If/once these issues are fixed, I'll have absolutely no problem with the game.Pros:Wacky but exciting storyFantastic soundtrackPlenty of content/questsSatisfying and fun combat systemVery pretty visualsCons:Multiple technical issues (Resolution bug, microstuttering, white screen on AMD)Wonky camera anglesLimited settings menu (Can't adjust draw distance)Poor keyboard + mouse supportLocked to 60FPS, 30FPS cutscenesThe game runs fine on my system with no crashes, but I've heard of framerate drops/crashing on systems with AMD cards			"

												NieR Automata is by far the best game I have played in my life, and for many reasons.I initally got into the series at NieR Gestalt, and went back and played some of the Drakengard games  as well.As much as those games are master pieces in their own right, this game goes far above, and beyond it's predecessors.Simutaniously this game gives many nods to the old games in a way that doesn't impede upon a new players experience.This is a game that stands proudly, and firmly on it's own two Android legs.It is full of highs, and lows, and explores themes of love, hate, anger, consciousness,  life, existence, death, and much more! (It is my wish to avoid spoilers, so I will keep this review as ambiguous as possible.)More mature players that are willing to surrender themselves to this experience will truly appreciate their time with this game.Too easy/hard? Change the difficulty settings!On my first playtrhough on normal I found the difficulty to be very fair.My advice is to go through the story, as much as you can without worrying, or looking too many things up.If you have your own experience with this you will be greatly rewarded in a way that most games won't fulfill you in.Finish it at your own speed, be it fast or slow.I personally favoured a very slow pace, and enjoyed the combat, and scenery as much as I could.It was very easy to do this once I set aside my usual overly efficient mind set, and mentality. This game was well worth the money, just make sure you have a gamepad for the best experience!I will eventually come back to 100 % this game, but for now it has left an after glow that will radiate, and resonate within me for a very long time.Thank you to everyone that was involved in the making of this game, truly! Thank you for allowing it to come to PC, as I wouldn't of gotten to experience it had it not, and after playing this game I can truly say it was an experience worth having.			"

												Probably the best game I've played so far this year. Performance issues a side which for me at least wern't to bad with some FPS drops now and then and the resolution looking a little wonky. Other then that game was great. Its like you mixed Devil may Cry and a open world RPG all in to one. good story although to get the full story you have to beat it multiple times and i have just finished my first play through. Controls feel tight and a controller is recomended and  Combat is a blast.9/10			"

												So far this game is extremely solid and takes a little while to really appreciate what is actually going on structurally. I think people see it and assume it's some kind of Devil May Cry game, but the reality is that it's like a 3 dimensional bullet hell game and a close quarters melee game combined into one. Piled on top of that very interesting blend of game modes is a pretty interesting story that branches into multiple endings, as well as some pretty deep item/weapon/skill management elements. Overall it's a game that manages to have engaging gameplay that could've been really shallow, but is fortified through story and weapons/skills and an open world.Personally, one of the most interesting features of this game is the way it treats the camera. Often it will give you the standard dual axis control scheme, but other times it goes into a 2.5D sidescroller or a top down shooter style, which works remarkably well. Overall it has a pretty cinematic vibe in the way it handles player control with the camera. The story is also good, but like all good story driven games, it's mostly there to facilitate gameplay and doesn't really strike me as a movie I'd watch through cutscenes or anything like that.			"

												If you like a game with a captivating and unpredictable story, NieR:Automata provides that. Many times have I thought that the game was going to have a predictable and cliche outcome but never have I before been proven wrong this many times that I continue to play over and over again regardless of knowing the story because just when you think the story is over, you replay it to find something new that changes the gameplay.Would rate this game a 10/10 and I highly reccomend it to people with a lot of time on their hands!

												""Poor english"" warning!I was kinda expecting another MGR:R or Bayonetta game as platinum was involved with this title. What I got was a bit of that and whole lot of emotions that I though a game couldn't make me feel.If you are in for this for the combat alone, you might be a bit disapointed. Controls are snappy and responsive, although the camera is a bit jank at times. There just isn't that much to do with combos as enemies either die so fast or have hyperarmor and poise trough your attacks so you end up getting hit, unless you evade mid combo. My playthough was on hard and I was +/- 5-ish levels from the enemies most of the time. Some plug-in chips (permanent stat boosts and special abilities) and Pod-programs (your little turret friend) can help to counter some of the comboing thing which made the combat more fun for me.The feel of the world is empty, with the occasional mob pack roaming around. The amazing music adds very much to this feeling of emptiness. As the layout of the land changes so does the music to reflect it. The areas may not look graphically amazing by modern day standards (low quality models and textures up close) but the are each unique by their own means.Most of the sidequests are quite stale. ""Go there. Kill this. Talk to this person. Gather this. Come back."" But the little bit of dialogue you get from most of them made questing worth for me. Some of them made me a bit emotional, be it happy, sad, troubled... I didn't expect this from mere sidequests. But some might just find the story dull.When things do pick up, man do they pick up and fast and wierd ways. Story included. Most bosses are quite hectic and awesome aside a few bad ones. Bosses mix the games different mechanics nicely although most of them are just your typical Platinum style bosses with 3rd person view.I won't go to the story much as I want to keep it as spoiler free as possible. I just say it digs quite deep about the meaning of being human/alive. But if you get this game, DON'T STOP AT THE FIRST ENDING. The game has so much more content after you have beaten it once. Never have I felt so, I don't know, uncertain... ? at a games end. In most turns it manages to mess with your brain in wierd ways. The element of suprise is one of its biggest pros.Conclusion: Storywise the game is one of the most memorable I have played. It certainly got me interested in the universe. Gameplaywise it isn't the greatest character action game out there, but it's quite high up there. The genre mashing makes it unique (even though it's similar to the first Nier which I haven't played).And if you fear that the game is too difficult it does feature a easy mode so you can experience the story if you would like.

												Well I have to say this is one of the best game I've played in quite sometime. Story is sort meh or little above average. Has the typical angsty teenage love crush story been there done that in SO many animes. But I digress for a Japanese title, however gameplay is king. Part Rpg, part hack n' slash, part platforming, part shoot em up you'd think this game would be a mess, implementation seemlessly transition together quite nicely. At time times you'll feel badass beating enimies using certain atrributes and fighting style and be justified for it. Some parts do get a little odd or prolonged but for the most part it's quite well exicuited giving rise to some gripes.Especially when the game takes control that it's trying to be different or meta to an extreme. Example when you you're systems are infected with a virus you have to trot to a safe zone while immobilized and vunerable to enimies around around you. Tril and error and mostly luck will get you passed this point. I know the game is probably saying ""have you ever tried taking control of an fried toaster?"" and the game (umung other thing) gives that exerience. I understand it's trying to break the form. However it's an annoying, cumbersome, and really do not see the point in my eyes. Maybe I'm not understading the conveyance, but I wasn't a a happy gamer at that point. Maybe some could explain the intention and meaning. But I really don't see it.All in all great game; pays homage to many classic generas in direct and indirect ways with a lot of heart and care. Gives credence to replayablity in way that's works very well. I wish more game would offer it the way it's presented.			"

												Going into this game, I knew nothing about Nier outside of it looking interesting. Now that I am close to finishing my 2nd playthrough I must say that I really like the game. The story CAN be fairly short if you skip side quests, but the game is also meant to be played through a few times. I love how the game implements different playstyles in to one game (bullet hell, side scroller, ect...). Sometimes they feel a bit too forced, but nonetheless end up feeling good and keeping the game interesting and changing.For those who are having fullscreen/windowed issues, there are programs out to help with it, I use something called ""windowedborderlessgaming"" from a WesTech site and it works great for me.

It's hard to say, well really anything about this game without it being spoilers so I'll just say these two things.1: After the initial crazyness the game feels like it slows down to a crawl and you'll probably ask yourself if you even want to keep playing it. Follow the main questline until you're done with desert area. Don't give up before then, it will only take you a few hours at most.2: Make sure you don't stop the first time you see the credits roll. You aren't even half way done. Keep playing, it gets even better after your first credits.			"

												This game had such a prodound experience on me, I will remember it for the rest of my life. I realize this sounds cheesy, but let me explain.In the beginning I cared about my character. After a while I found myself caring about other characters not just myself. This then elevated to caring about other characters as my character would in the world. Then as I played more, and got deeper and deeper in the story and relationships, I began thinking, feeling, and acting as my character in the world. Nier is so incredible that when I played, I became that character fully, sharing their pain, thier love, their emotions...etc. I found myself reacting to situations as if they were actually happenening afk. I began to physically experience the story as the characters in the game would, getting chills, quickening heartbeat, sadness, joy, anger...I've never had this sort of experience with a game before.When I was finished, I honestly felt as though I had been with the characters through it all from the moment I began.I cannot express anymore how incredible the experience of this game is.( I'd recommend using the original language of Japanese and eng subs - but if you're really against that they have like 5 languages to choose from ^_^ )Nier Automata makes me happy. sad. angry. nervous. proud. confident. In some ways, just as (if not more) events in my actual life.			"

												This is quite frankly one of the best games I've ever played. A responsible active battle system, on top of a beautiful world for you to explore, with deep characters and a multi-layer storyline, topped with a great soundtrack.Keep in mind that ""playing again once you beat it the first time"", in this game, is not ""replayability"". It's part of the story. If you thought you knew what the game was about after finishing it once, you're in for a ride. You've not finished this game at all until you play it to at least three of the endings.The plot thickens. The characters get more human. You get to all the characters better (even the enemies), understand what happened from their point of view, and actually get to the bottom of what is actually happening.I highly recommend you play this with a joystick (I myself play with a DS4). Oh, and if you're wondering, you can play it with the audio in Japanese, and English subtitles.			"

												18 hours logged on steam,A few of them probably in pause menu afk..Spoiler free I wouldn't say I'm too far into the game..I've just unlocked fast travel.. Graphics, once I installed the mod..absolutely perfect running at 60FPS no glitches mostly maxed settings. Soundtrack, is absolutely amazing...adds real depth to the game, music is usually really well suited and fits well to the areas that your currently in. I think Emi Evans who did a lot of the Dark Souls soundtrack is quite involved..Gameplay, The combat is really adjustable,dynamic and fluent with many on the fly settings.. Plays highly similar to that of Metal Gear Rising mixed with Final Fantasy 15. Many ways and forms to evade certain enemy attacks,link hundreds of combos together..with over 40 weapons each with their own particular 4 styles.The chip system once you get past the peculiartiy of it is really quite intricate.. A way to describe or compare it would be to FF9 abilities stones/AP... You have a chipboard.. which is your max AP which is upgradable as you progress and farm materials.. And the chips you find along the way are the abilities...you can tailor them specifically for what you need.The story so far seems pretty rich, but easy to understand, I particurlarly like how it stands out from most other games as i've not really seen anything set in this setting...Controls..Have to be honest i'm using a 360 controller.But i picked up the controls in a matter of minutes.Check it out!

												I didn't go into Nier:Automata with any great expectations, I simply was looking for a fun game to play to fill a lull in my gaming life, but what I got was so much more. First thing's first; I've never played a Nier or Drakengard game before this one so you don't need that level of familiarity to enjoy this game, though I don't doubt it would add more to the experience. The combat is fast paced, varied, and fun without being overbearing so of you're looking for a game that actually is just fun to PLAY then this is your game. However, it's the story and the emotion it brings to bear that really prompted me to write out a review. Most of your time will be spent getting to know our stylish androids better, but if you see everything the game has to offer you'll feel a part of this world and this community in a way few games are capable of achieving. To summarize an already brief summary, I wholeheartedly recommend it.			"

												Here is a simple quick review:Easily game of the year 2017, or at the very least best soundtrack of the year.*Awesome fun gameplay----------------------> Check*Great polish and attention to detail-----------> Check*The absolute best soundtrack in a long time -> Check*Will it make you cry?-------------------------> Check*Will you want to play it all over again and again and again?---------->Check*Does it have any replay value?---------------------------------------->Check (26 endings)*Will you get your money's worth out of this?------------------------->Double Check!This game reminds me of how games used to be in old times, especially with it's weird (in a good way) style of camera movement and awesome gameplay, it will remind you of the good old times, to be frankly honest, if you buy this game for (60$) just to listen to it's score, then that alone is already so much worth it.Bottom Line: this is my first review ever and as you can tell I'm no expert in writing reviews,I just can't praise this game enough.10/10			"

												In the past couple of years I have played plenty of games, watched plenty of series and movies as well as spending plenty of time with my lads. After 5 years time this game reminded me what it is to enjoy a game. A game that is immersive, a story that is interesting yet sad. A combat system that is fluent. A grinding system that knows its limit so that you won't spend decades in the search of one item and the soundtracks... those are a masterpiece. There are plenty of games with better graphics, better effects, a better story, better sounds, but do they all have these great aspects in a single game? If it weren't for Witcher 3 and GTA V I'd call this game the most complete and finished product that has been created in the past 5 years. It reminded me once again what it is to enjoy games.Luckily enough my setup can handle this game at max settings without any resolution bugs or whatsoever. There are some players experiencing some issues, but that shouldn't stop you from trying this game as the person behind it is a genius that you will encounter rarely in the gaming industry. For the given issues there are plenty of work arounds. I talk about the content as this game is easily spoiled, but the trailers show you a fraction of what is waiting for you once you purchase this divine product.			"

												Epic gameplay for the creative players out there who don't just hack and slash. Music is great too.As others have said, this could use a patch for the upscaled 1080p blurry visuals.Workaround is to run the game in windowed mode and use ""Borderless Gaming"" app to make it ""borderless windowed."" This will retain the 1080p visuals and not degrade it. Plays well with Xbox One Controller. I'd buy it if you can deal with the 1080p-upscaled short-coming until a patch comes out (hopefully). "

												Played for well over an hour (my above play-time is inaccurate, as I hadn't yet found a place to save, so I went afk to eat), and have yet to find a save point. Enjoyed awesome edge-of-the-seat gameplay....and after fighting gigantic excavators and probably hundreds of hum-drum enemies, I decided to order a pizza....paused the game after ordering said pizza to return to a crashed game, that had not saved in any way whatsoever.....I tried to save manually before ordering my carb-laden dinner, but to no avail...so I thought it would be ok...I was very wrong....Why can I not save my progress an hour into the game Squenix? WTF? FIX YOUR GAME!I'm very reluctant to click the recommended button....the gameplay is fantastic, and the story so far is good, but why can't I save my game an hour into it? I'll recommend it only with a word of caution.....who knows when you'll be able to actually create a save file?What I've played so far is action packed, story rich, with a soundtrack that fits like a glove, but for heals sake, fix this shiz and offer us a save before the second hour of the game....otherwise you'll get a lot of bad reviews, sqeeenix.

												UPDATE - I'm still leaving this to not recommended for the time being until it is patched, but there is a work around for the blank screen on AMD RX 400 series cards. First, do a clean install with Display Driver Uninstaller. Make sure to do it through safe mode, and you might want to create a backup / system restore just in case. Link here. https://www.guru3d.com/files-get/display-driver-uninstaller-download,1.htmlNext, install driver 16.11.15 - http://support.amd.com/en-us/download/desktop/previous/detail?os=Windows%2010%20-%2064&rev=16.11.5#You should be good to go then. there is some noticeable stuttering here and there with this temporary fix, but it's certainly better than not being able to play the game at all. ORIGINAL REVIEW BEFORE WORK AROUND - Needs to be patched. There is definitely an issue with getting a freeze into a blank/white screen (one time it was blue for me even) for different users with different hardware. Many, including myself, can barely get pass the first boss, and for some it happens straight from launch. It seems to be fairly across the board for AMD users currently, despite Square Enix claiming its driver 17.2.1, and there are reports of it happening from Nvidia users. I have an RX 480 8gb personally, and have tried different drivers and messing around the settings and it still happened despite my efforts. It is unplayable due to this issue.There is also the issue of fullscreen not properly displaying, instead displaying a much lower resolution. For me I use 1920x1080, and it seems to be displaying in 1600x900 or so leading to desaturation and stretched images  or black bars. It can be worked around with the Borderless Gaming program, but Borderless Gaming does put in some input lag which is not ideal for a game such as Nier: Automata. This needs to be fixed as well.			"

												I liked the gameplay when I could play it but now the game crashes and goes to a small white window everytime I try to run it. I'm assuming this might be an issue with AMD chipset because I run an Fx9590 CPU, Radeon R9 390x 8GB VRAM, 16GB RAM. I love the game and really want to play it, but I guess I have to wait until either they release a patch that remedies this issue with AMD chipsets or wait till AMD releases a new update for Crimson. Till then I guess I'll just watch this sit in my library while I wait. T.TEdit: Well I turned off AA and dropped Texture Filter to I think about 6 or 8 and I get like 40-45 FPS. I'm just assuming the game isn't optimized for AMD so until they patch it later on.			"

												NieR Automata is fast becoming one of my favourite games of all time.  The game traverses between a first-person hack 'n' slash, 2D platformer, side-shooter and overhead-view, and it works really well.  The combat system is simple but effective, the bosses are challenging without being OP, the storyline is as wonderfully weird as you'd expect from a Yoko Taro game and the soundtrack is one of the best I've ever come across.  Seriously, it needs to be released as a stand-alone, it's that good. Drawbacks?  Well, sometimes fights can get a little confusing if you're up against a lot of enemies at once, and the tutorial is needlessly long.  Other than that, NieR Automata should be a serious contender for GOTY, IMHO.			"

												This is a good game. Pros:- Smooth like butter combat system- Great variety in gameplay- BEAUTIFUL graphics whether it be characters, world, or action- A great thought-provoking story which can be followed without prior knowledge of the first Nier Game(s)- Boss battles got me like OMGSOGUD- High replayabilityCons:- Not so much variety in minion enemies, most of what you fight will be machine-type. However there are many different forms within that type.- The balloon bullets. Its 2017 and I feel there are better ways to disguise the bullet hell nature of Nier: Automata. - The map. I got so sick of wandering around the same landscape over and over again to accomplish side quests. Its a beautiful world, but small and if you do all the side quests, Nier: Automata becomes such a grind.Like I said, a good game and in my opinion well worth the money.			"

												Two of my favorite gaming genres are fighting games and shmups, I love arcade style action. Platinum managed to blend those styles of play into a JRPG of all things leaving me very impressed.I came to this game via being a fan of Platinum. I never played the first Nier game and don't play a ton of RPGs in general. This combat system is a bit more forgiving than games like Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, which Platinum also designed, but I totally loved it. The boss battles were especially rewarding with timing of blocks and counter attacks and on-the-fly weapon loadout swaps.The system of managing your character's stats as chips is also really cool. You have a finite area to plug them in, and the more special chips (with a diamond symbol) can perform the same routine while taking up a smaller number of ""slots"" so you get the same stat boost more efficiently. The game allows you to re-arrange and swap out chips to rebuild your entire character's spec as needed. I really enjoyed remapping the whole stack for boss encounters - really unique system and I hope other games steal this idea.I just finished playing my 3rd play through (2nd is a different perspective same timeline, 3rd is continuation of the story so at least 3 plays needed, don't stop!) and wow - it shot to the top 5 games of all time for me. Don't miss it - what a surprise. A Masterpiece like this doesn’t come along very often.			"

												The game was good, great even. Not perfect. The music was amazing, the audio direction equally so.The story was a deep, but kind of falls off the deep end since its not fully explained. BUT, without a doubt, this games final credits sequence, the most emotional part of the whole game. Its so mundane, but the way they present it was the most powerful thing I have seen in a game, at least meta wise. Too bad they couldn't pull off that kind of thing across the board though. 10/11, so close to perfection, but fell a tad short. If they make another game, I am sure it will reach 11.			"

												Yoko Taro's approach to storytelling is like increasing the temperature of a hot tub by 1 degree at a time. You won't notice the difference until you look down after 30 hours and realize you're in a pool of lava. Only then will you realize you actually prefer lava.Each Drakengard game starts with a simple and relatable premise: Man and dragon fight evil empire. Father wants to find a cure for his sick daughter. And NieR: Automata, at its surface level, is about androids battling machine-servants of aliens while humanity takes refuge on the moon. If it sounds like your typical JRPG sci-fi story, congratulations: You've fallen into Taro's trap. To call the events of the game a mindf**k is both accurate and a disservice. It implies a lack of meaning or direction, when in reality you're given everything you need in order to understand the story; it just might not come in the order you like. Not only is the main story an enigma that leaves you hungry for more details, but even the sidequests add important context to the events of the story, as well as having some seriously strong foreshadowing that you'll likely miss until you're thinking in retrospect. And that's the real beauty of a Taro story: it keeps you occupied for weeks after you finish the game as you slowly stumble upon epiphanies, information the game gave you clear as day but that your brain failed to piece together until it was too late. After several of these moments you'll come to not only love the game, but respect the writers as intellectual superiors that played you like a damn fiddle while, somehow, respecting your intelligence at the same time. If you've played a JRPG in the past, you know that there is often a trifecta of qualities and you have to pick two and only two: graphics, gameplay, and story. If a game has great graphics and gameplay, it usually has a bad story (Bayonetta, DMC, etc.). If it has a fantastic story, it usually either has bad gameplay or bad graphics (Xenoblade). The pattern so far for Drakengard has been good story, decent gameplay, and bad graphics. However, they've teamed up with Platinum Games this time, who's known for great gameplay, good graphics, and bad story. Combined, they've managed to cover each other's flaws beautifully. This game is a treat to look at, the gameplay is fun as hell, and the story is some of Taro's best work yet.I can't remember the last time I had so few complaints about a game, and I'm an incredibly harsh critic of games (especially ones that I love). Throughout NieR: Automata, I kept thinking ""what's the catch?"" There has to be a really terrible part coming up soon, right? No game goes this long without any glaring issues. That point never came, though.If you've never played Drakengard, you'll probably still have a great time with this game. If you've played most of the series up to this point, it's a masterpiece.			"

												This is one of the most amazing games I have ever played. It is very enjoyable and the story is fasinating. It has a steep learning curve and thoughout the game you are taking new techniques that you ahve discovered and applying them to new situations as well as combining them for new combos. The varity of weapons means that there is several different styles of fighting that you can try out. The side stories themselves while not needed are also very interesting. Just when you think you have seen it all something new comes up. This is a game that you should buy and once you do the sheer enjoyment you get will be huge.			"

												It's pretty f*king amazing, that's what it is. Sublime combat, intense bullet-hell sections, characters you will fall for and a story as tragic as it is beautiful. There's a message that Nier:Automata delivers at its true ending (E), and everything from the start until that point is the epitome of what a video game should be all about. The shifting perspectives over the course of the game make for a compelling narrative. And if you don't care about all that philosophical crap, you'll enjoy the combat as a stand-alone too.I couldn't recommend this game more, as long as you have the time to devote to it. 40-50 hours at the minimum. Also, preserve your sanity and use a controller.A2 is best girl.Summary Gameplay Value - 4.5/5. Story & Writing - 4.5/5. Sound Design - 5/5. Visuals & Special Effects - 4/5. OVERALL - 4.5/5 "

												In a world filled with games trying harder and harder to work closer to real world rules and hyperrealism, Nier: Automata tries to be as videogamey as it can be, telling a story only a game could tell. This game made me rediscover my love for games.Gameplay elements are brilliant: this is the best ARPG combat ever made, and constantly freshens itself with dynamic twists and turns. You may or may not like english voice acting, I found it great. Every character was distinctive and recognizable by voice only. The soundtrack quality is marvelous and memorable. I ended up caring for all important characters far more than I expected. It has some flaws, like some pacing problems, graphics aren't great, and the PC port is not as good as it deserves to be. I'm willing to forgive all of it due to the amaizing ride it was, even the credits were able to convey huge feels into my heart! P.D. A big thank you to those who fell by aiding me, you are truly appreciated!			"

												I bought this game mostly on a whim because I had some money lying around in my Steam wallet and because Jim Sterling recommended it. This turned out to be a fantastic decision. Here's a quick rundown of why I can highly recommend this game:Pro:- The storyline is fantastic: it comes with several plot twists, is highly nuanced, extremely dark and full of philosophical undertones (-> existentialism and absurdism). As someone who really enjoys that kind of thing (e.g. I also really liked SOMA for this reason) this alone makes the game worth while.- The soundtrack is incredible and I really hope it finds its way onto Spotify. It's not just that the individual tracks are beautiful and memorable but also that they are used to great effect in the actual game. For example, some of the songs sync up really well with certain boss battles.- Overall, the game is quite original and is certainly a breath of fresh air in an industry oversaturated with AAA titles full of rehashed concepts.- The animations are really fluid and the combat (especially the boss fights) looks pretty damn cool.- While the graphics aren't particularly noteworthy from a technical perspective the game features tons of varied and beautiful environments. At the same time it manages to keep a cohesive aesthetic throughout the entire game.- Some of the sidequests are really interesting and tie into the main storyline in important ways.Contra:- Some of the sidequests have dull / annoying objectives (fetch quests, escort quests etc.) and there is quite a bit of backtracking. The game is clearly aware of this as one of the main characters even complains about it multiple times. That doesn't make it that much better, though.- There are some technical issues with the game such as the fact that it doesn't run in 1080p fullscreen currently (however, this can be easily fixed using Borderless Gaming). Also, there is a noticeable amount of texture pop-in particularly in the ruined city area. However, I did not encounter any serious glitches or crashes.- The combat can get a little bit repetitive by the end of the game.- The game initially recommends the ""normal"" difficulty but even as someone who doesn't really play singleplayer games for the challenge I found that the game became way to easy towards the end. If you put any effort into optimizing your plugin chips you'll be nearly invincible on normal.Overall I'd give NieR: Automata a strong 9/10 and even though we're only 3 months into 2017 I'd be quite surprised if a better game comes out this year. Also, if you decide to pick up this game you must keep playing after the first ""ending"" since otherwise you'll miss most of what makes this game so good.			"

												Neir is a fast-paced hack-and-slash title with lots of other elements - such as bullet hell, top-down combat, and platforming - tied together with an absolutely god-tier story and execution. Having completed the game, I can say with confidence this is one of the best video games I've had the pleasure to play, both because the gameplay is awesome and the story is unmatched.  It is absolutely a one-of-a-kind video game in all of the best ways.That said, a more detailed, spoiler-free breakdown below. See ""Verdict"" at the bottom for the tl;dr version:The Good: Story, direction, soundtrack, execution of gameplay mechanicsBasic combat is fast, brutal, and has a high skill ceiling (but, see ""Difficulty"" below)Non-traditional combat elements (bullet-hell, top-down combat, platforming) bring an interesting and fun feel to the game not present in any other hack-n-slash titlesThe story is absolutely incredible, both in its writing and presentation. Thematically, everything in this game fits so well; how saves, upgrades, respawning, and every other gameplay mechanic works in this game are explained within the universe that the game takes place. This does wonders for immersion and is a very unique experience you won't find in other titles.RPG mechanics find an excellent balance between allowing for customization, and not requiring constant micro-management.The soundtrack is phenomenal.Dual-Audio support; you can easily select if you'd like to use the original Japanese or English audio/voice actors in settings. Both have full subtitle support for all voices in game, whether in cutscenes or during gameplay.The Bad: Performance, difficulty, gameplay cameraNote 1: I'm running an Intel i7-6700k, Gitgabyte GTX 970 Windforce (4Gb), and 16Gb RAM on Windows 10.Note 2: The FAR fix by Kaldein, which can be found pinned to the top of Nier: Automota's discussion thread in Steam, will fix all performance issues listed below with little effort. Kaldein is a reputable and well-established modder in the community, and has put out a variety of high-quality fixes for poorly performing games.The FAR fix will fix the following performance issues:Performance is very poor by default. Without getting into the technical details, the game is terribly optimized and many features are broken by default (most glaring are fullscreen and vsync). FAR makes performance anywhere from 30-75% better framerate-wise.Fullscreen does not function by default, it is either totally broken or it will not run the game in fullscreen at your monitor's native resolution (instead it runs it at a lower resolution and upscales).In-game Vsync is broken by default; it causes performance issues and locks gameplay to 30fps.The following performance issues CANNOT be fixed:Freezing is a common occurence for some users. The FAR fix seems to mitigate freezing, but it can still happen. Disable all background programs and overlays to avoid freezingKeyboard/Mouse controls aren't the best, the main issues being with dodging and aiming in the bullet-hell parts. Keyboard/mouse is usable, but you WILL WANT to use a controller w/ NierGameplay is capped at 60fps, I don't personally see this as a huge issue, but some willCutscenes are capped at 30fps/900p, and suffer from noticeable stuttering and frame drops.Other non-performance issues: Difficulty, gameplay cameraDifficulty is hand's down the biggest issue with this game, bar none. Normal difficulty is very simple and presents little challenge. Hard is frustratingly difficult early on, but regresses to being very simple once you get about 1/3 of the way through the game. Very Hard literally makes all enemies one-shot you (that's the description under ""Very Hard"") and it's unbeatable for all intents and purposes. Default camera: The default camera settings are pretty poor, low-sensitivity and a close camera makes it very difficult to see what is happening. If you are playing on hard or very hard, you WILL take random pot-shots that one-shot you and you could not see coming. Increase the camera height and sensitivity for a much better experience.Hard/Very Hard difficulty remove the ""Lock-on"" button. The main purpose of this is so that you cannot constantly spam targeted range attacks at enemies, which makes sense. The problem is it makes it very difficult to quickly and accurately switch between enemies and change your camera, which is very important on Hard/Very Hard. To help with this issue, I suggest changing the default ""Lock-On"" key to ""Reset Camera"" when you are on Hard/Very Hard.Verdict: ABSOLUTELY BUY this game if you are even mildly interested.Though I didn't spend as much time on the great parts about this game so I can avoid spoilers, that's not to say the good doesn't vastly outweigh the bad. The story is GOD TIER. The thematic immersion of gameplay elements is one-of-a-kind. The melding of hack-n-slash with other gameplay types is extremely fun and very well done. The soundtrack and voice acting are stellar. The RPG mechanics are incredibly balanced. THESE THINGS FAR OUTWEIGH MY COMPLAINTS.The current performance issues can be a pain, but the FAR fix makes the game run extremely well and very enjoyable to play.The difficulty is my biggest complaint, but the gameplay is still phenominal. I'm a pretty hardcore hack-n-slash player though, so this may not be as much of an issue for others. "

												If you're a fan of action games from Platinum this may be a step down in the gameplay department by a bit if you play the game on normal. However, it can be a bit punishing if you play it on hard which makes it a tough sell as a pure action game.  All and all it's a great game with a deep philosophical undertone with some bad gameplay pacing issues. There's also a ton of side missions and a lot of hidden bosses and side quests that make it interesting after the story, but it’s marred that you have to select the correct chapter for that mission while the game doesn't let you know if the selection you're selecting has access to it.  TL;DR: Turn it up to hard and take your time with it to get as many side quests done on your first go around.			"

												2 weeks after its release, the game is still unplayable for GTX 700 series owners (and possibly RX 480 and noticed some GTX Titan complains here and there), it's still brimming with technical issues and poor optimization across platforms (poorly optimized for consoles which carried over and brought even more problems for the PC version).It's an action game and, given that the game's engine is bound to the framerates you can get, attaining 50+ or solid 60 is mandatory for the enjoyment of the game. And that makes the poor optimization that results to framedrops (no matter its source) worse than it is in any other game.2 weeks later, no patch yet to be seen. Imagine paying for a game you found you cannot complete due to crashing, and have to wait for ""some day"" to be resolved. Imagine that you waited for that game for months, if not years if you were a fan of the Nier/Drakengard games.I cannot upvote this game on the grounds of ""it plays on other people's machines"". If you cannot approproately support the hardware diversity of the PC. I cannot believe this it the kind of treatment PC consumers receive from Platinum, after the work they did with Metal Gear Rising:Revengeance. Now I know which company's game I won't preorder again.			"

												I would recommend this game to people who know what they are getting into and like these type of action-packed spectacle fighters. To those who are on the fence, I'd say wait for a sale because IMO it is a mixed bag. But overall still a good game and I quite like it.The good part:The gameplay itself. Altough I haven't played that much yet I really like the fighting, the variety (changing from 3d fighting to 2d and sometimes twin stick is actually more fun than I at first thought when I heard about it), the music and sound. In general I don't have anything bad to say about the game itself... and that is a good thing :)The bad is the technical side. I am running at 21:9 (2560x1080) and it does work without any tricks but it is clearly not optimized for that. You will sometimes see stretched and blurry menus and what you would expect. But the game itself and the cutscenes work in 21:9 just fine so that's a plus. Besides that I am running a gtx 1070 and had no fps drops, crashes or the likes so far. FPS were stable but the cutscenes are limited to 30 fps and you do notice that quite heavily. There are other times where you feel this is a console port (menus, twin stick shooter...) but overall it's runs fine on my pc.			"

												Developers have acknowledged the optimization issues and the community is trying to help at the time of this post.Nier: Automata is a sequel to Nier set in sum 7000 years into the future from Nier Gestalt in a post-apocolyptic setting following what was the 14th Machine War. The player plays as an android who belongs to an organization to protect humanity, or what's left of it, called YoRHa. YoRHa seemingly created these sentient androids as strategy to preserve what is left of humanity and hopes to defend the remaining humans on the moon. While open world games can be a hit or miss (moreover miss) Nier: Automata makes good use and sense for their open world enviornment through the different biomes and environments. Players will regularly inspect subtle design choices in the environments giving a very believable artistic edge to the fantasy style of the game. Even the fixed camera angels during some of the transitions feel right and add some integrity to the games style. (It's really nice to see a post-apocolyptic style game that isn't a brown and dusty bowl.)Gameplay is also very refreshing. Players are regularly rewarded for correcting their combat mistakes, even the tutorial forces players to really begin understanding the mechanics before you can even reach the first save point. This helps deter players who think they can glide through the gameplay by mashing buttons without a thought. And while the game is (what seems to be) loaded with sidequests to help add some gameplay fluff, they can be vital for extra materials, items, and levels so players are not grinding out levels to progress the main story more smoothly.The sounds are what I would expect from this series. Like Nier, Nier: Automata has the same excellent composers perfect for the style of the settings. Each track seems to have a lot of thought and care poured in by how well they reflect the setting and situation. Being as mechanical and robotic as it is, its surprising how much time went into giving the many robots and androids different personalities and traits giving a lot of life to the machines. And while I am not in love with the english voice acting they aren't necessarily bad in any way, though it is good the team decided to include dual audio as they should.While being familiar with Nier is preferred, it is in no way required to get the full enjoyment out of this game.This brings back what games should be.

This review is from someone who has never heard of Nier or played any of Yoko Taro's games. Deep story with well over 40+ hours of story to unfold. AND IM TALKING DEEEP M8!@! I have 55 hours at the time of writing this with only 15 endings under my belt, and I haven't started my ""Very Hard"" playthrough yet. Yes....I'm addicted. The Combat system while easy for newcomers to hack and slash, also has a lot of depth in terms of combos. Mostly being the combos that involve your Pod companion(he it pew pews while you slice and dice) and combos with delays.There a plenty more combos involving dash and jump, but you'll figure it out.With 30+ weapons that all have different weights/timings/combos that switch out on the fly , I'm sure everyone can find weapons suitable to their playstyle.Last but not least, the SOUND TRACK, this is the center piece that brings everything together. The chilling feel of anxiety brushes over you everystep of the way, drawing you in to the story. I even listen to the sound track when im not playing the game...it's that ♥♥♥♥ing good!I had no performance issues other than Video cutscenes run at reduced framerates (assuming due to the compression?).Other than that, the game crashed once in 55 hours of gameplay.Game is capped at 60 FPSCpu: i7-3770kGPU: GTX 1080Resolution: 1920x1080So make sure to call your phycologist and schedule an appointment for ~5 days after the purchase of this game. Tell them you need to talk some real deep ♥♥♥♥, they will more than likely know why you are calling and refer you to a Nier recovery specialist.Proposal: Buy this game for the Glory of Humankind :yorha:			"

												Game of the year contender. After completing the first ending i just thought it was pretty good and took a break from it. After coming back to finish the other endings I couldn't put it down until I fully finished the story I was so utterly encapsulated by it. 9S's character development makes him one of my all time favorite tragic characters, his voice actor deserves some serious praise. If you see any complaining about the length of the game its likely the person didn't play past the first 'ending' which is definitely not the end of the game at all, more like a chapter.			"

												TL;DR Worth every 0.00001 of a penny (penny value may varies base on your region)STORY: Yoko Taro story is legendary as usual, dark theme with humour mixed in that you just can't find anywhere else. He'll randomly try to cheer you up as you progress along and holy hell do you need one sometimes. Think of it like you suffering through college and your uncle popping in once a while and give you a fluffy cat toy even though you don't have a cat.MUSIC&SOUND: music fit every part of the story and story fit every part of the music. Can't ask for anything more except for....well........more. GAMEPLAY: play it on Hard cuz you won't regret suffering through every bit of it. Not on ""very hard"" though, that's just sadisticGRAPHIC&DESIGN: Do you like explosion that was placed in for explosion sake? You'll get none of that here. Everything has it's place and purpose. Fanservice is also baked right into the character so there won't be a filler/fanservice episode/part of the story. Probably the only game that make me return to singleplayer after 10 years of pure multiplayer. It's just amazing of how much work goes into this. "

												2 weeks after its release, the game is still unplayable for GTX 700 series owners (and possibly RX 480 and noticed some GTX Titan complains here and there), it's still brimming with technical issues and poor optimization across platforms (poorly optimized for consoles which carried over and brought even more problems for the PC version).It's an action game and, given that the game's engine is bound to the framerates you can get, attaining 50+ or solid 60 is mandatory for the enjoyment of the game. And that makes the poor optimization that results to framedrops (no matter its source) worse than it is in any other game.2 weeks later, no patch yet to be seen. Imagine paying for a game you found you cannot complete due to crashing, and have to wait for ""some day"" to be resolved. Imagine that you waited for that game for months, if not years if you were a fan of the Nier/Drakengard games.I cannot upvote this game on the grounds of ""it plays on other people's machines"". If you cannot approproately support the hardware diversity of the PC. I cannot believe this it the kind of treatment PC consumers receive from Platinum, after the work they did with Metal Gear Rising:Revengeance. Now I know which company's game I won't preorder again.			"

Honestly can't tell if it's my computer or the game that's being weird.- Open world feels very closed off, with a lot of invisible walls. Not too big of an issue, but it makes the world feel a lot more empty. Especially if you're trying to enter a building with a large whole in the wall, and you get blocked by a wall that isn't there.But it really is a lot of fun, story's pretty good too. Bossfights have been a lot of fun so far, but I strongly suggest turning up the difficulty option to hard. Very hard is just silly hard though.			"

												I've never really ever been invested into the plot of games, usually I play games for the gameplay aspect and that alone. I discovered Nier:Automata about a month before its release and followed it closely anicipating the release. When I finally finished the game (make sure you continue playing after the first playthrough) I realized how much I became invested into the story and characters. The gameplay is somewhat smooth, the combat is fluid, the atomosphere and environment are brilliant, and don't even get me started on the soundtrack. This game sucked me into the story really fast and every day I was dying to get home so I can see what happens next. Now I feel an empty void completing the story, but I don't plan to stop playing the game and I can see myself doing another playthrough in the near future. This is definitely my game of the year. If you're anything like me, this game will not disappoint and I 10/10 recommend this game to anyone.P.S. If you have an Xbox or PS controller I would highly recommend using that because for me the KB&M combo is a little wonky, at least for me			"

												I'm still making my way through my second playthrough as I attempt to 100% this game. I have to say that I'm really impressed considering I found the original game to be pretty mediocre at best. The combat is excellent. The world is beautiful and memorable. The story is touching. The music is simply magnificent and has been on my daily playlist since release. Just YouTube the OST if you don't believe me. As far as I can tell the game is meant to be played through at least 3 times and you see the world from a different pair of eyes each time. The story unveils even further with every successive playthrough and one playthrough is not all that long. The port itself is decent, but not that great. However, most of my issues with the port were resolved with Kaldaien's FAR mod. It should be on the discussion board for this game.This is a rating from what I've experienced so far. I know I haven't completed this game in its entirety yet. However, I have a feeling that my conclusion won't change much upon completion. In fact, it may just get better. This game is damn good and truly a treasure.			"

												I recently discovered the 'NieR' series on a hunt for music/OSTs that were akin to 'Shadow of the Colussus'. A lone comment in a reddit thread lead me to the first 'NieR' album and was pleasantly surprised to learn that NieR: Automata had literally just launched. Compelled by the music of that first album, I decided to purchase the game and give it a whirl.Initially I was concerned that I would need to play 'Drakengard' or the original 'NieR' in order to fully appreciate the game, as I had not. The game stands alone perfectly, like a different house in the same neighborhood (thousands of years in the future).I won't spoil the plot for you (So I won't remark on characters, etc.), but please note that game's story plays out a bit different than most. Instead of a -very- long story, it's a tad bit shorter if you think of it in a linear fashion. However, the story is structured in such a way that you revisit the same story from a completely different angle in a truly varied way, and it feels quite different (thus far). It's NOT the typical: change Yes to No and Ending A becomes Ending B. It's nothing like that, you'll definitely want to keep playing.Good: Combat is fun, the customization is an interesting spin, the music is SUPERB. Controller combat wasn't bad, I thought I was going to hate it, but it works well. Try all the weapons, try all the abilities. This game isn't about min/max. The scenery is bleak feeling, but gorgeous.Bad: Fullscreen looks atrocious, but the windowed setting looks great. There isn't an auto-save, so be warned! I was hoping for a little more varied enemies, but it's not too bad.Things I wish I knew first: Use your POD target/lock on to allow for certain combos. All weapons are fun in their own way, it's worth trying them all and upgrading them all as you can. Don't worry about 'maxing' them on the first play through.Last thoughts: For purchasing on a whim, based on the music, I'm more than pleasantly surprised how fun it is. This game is fantastic. 9/10			"

												So after beating the game (Completing all the main endings) I have to say that this has been the most fun I've had in a game for a while. From the smooth transition from attacks with different weapons (animations are on point from the start of the attack to recovering from a swing) to the hectic bullet-hell sections with constant views. Although I wish there were more bosses but every one we got was fantastic. Even the story although slow at some points kept me engaged and interested to the end. There are some small quirks with the game (frame rate drops between some cinematic parts. When shifting camera angles, movement controls go a little wonky. But nothing gamebreakinig that I have encountered. Overall this game was a blast to play and highly recommend to everyone to play.For the dark souls players try hard mode. From the first mins of the game it will force you to ""git gud"". And the bosses are easily the stars (outside of 2b,9s and A2) of this game. By far the final boss is the best encounter of any game I have played in a long time and shows how platinum games has beautifully combine all the mechanics to give us a satisfying fight.			"

												I'm usually one of those people that doesn't care about the stories and video games. I play games for the gameplay. Nier: Automata's story really left an impression on me. The story itself was good but it gained real impact from how it was told. I wasn't just watching something or reading something, I felt like an active participant in the narrative. It was an incredible experience.The gameplay is great and controls well.  The music is excellent and really enhances the tone of the story. Each area in the small open world uses strong visual designs and apart from the desert, which looks like a desert, I never grew tired of having to move through them.Overall, this game is one of my top gaming experiences.I also witnessed the best version of Romeo & Juliet as conceived by machines.

												*--POTENTIAL SPOILERS!!!--* (maybe small bits)I just finished my first run, and WOW, I haven't had an experience like this in a while.I'm not sure where to start so i'll just list my favorite thing about this game.The Story: I like the dystopia overrun by machines who left by an alien race that died off years ago, what made it especailly interesting was learning the differences in machines between areas, how they ""lived"" their lives. Not to mention the relationship 2B and 9S had, it was nice to see 2B progressively warm up to ""nines"".The Ending(s): I only have the A H W on my endings ( for those who dont know, neither do i), but the replayablity of this game is interesting and im really hoping its not the exact same story repeated, though I dont see that happeningThe Music: ...Byoutiful...The SKILLS: very well done I must admit. It has a Dark souls vibe to it aswell, where death means losing your upgrades and having to back track for them, or lose them which by the way not recommended. They can get expensive when you get in the higher tiers.That was most of the good... Now the BAD (Keep in mind this is on the experience of one playthrough)The camera angles: omg, i wish this wasnt an issue, but having to get use to a new camera angle whenever the game decides its time for TOP DOWN/3D-2D/THIRD PERSON/ETC is really obnoxious. I had moments where I kept taking damage from enemies i couldn't see because the camera forced a perspective on me and i couldn't adjust it properly.Length: I uderstand the replay mechanics, but it still seemed too short. I may, however, change my mind after a couple more replays.Weapons: so far theres not much in weapons that interested me. I ran with my entry katana and beastlord (can literally get it at the beginning of the game) the whole playthrough because no other weapons base damage where better.Traveling: the fast travel comes a little late in the game, not too late though. You had two options, Run or take the time to bait a beast and ride it. I would've much perfered an actual vehicle, like a hoverbike maybe? make it easier to travel through land, because you trip on every bush, dip and elevated step while sprinting, make worth a lot so you work for it like 20k-30k.All in all I give it a solid 9/10, I feel my dislikes of the game isn't too much to set it off too much. Except the camera. "

												What a fantastic game! Even with bad performance, I'm still having a great time playing this game! Just so you know, I'm playing with everthing on low and at 1366x768. And I have a GTX 760.This game needs to be played at 60fps, otherwise, it will look like it's in slow motion.About the game itself, I don't have many words to describe it.It has a good story, there is a lot of rpg elements, it's somehow open world...The gameplay is also quite good. Not very complicated. Every weapon has it's own combos.Anyway, this game is good. If you can somehow put behind the performance you will have a great game to play.9/10			"

												Reading about other people's performance issues, I actually researched Steam's return policy prior to purchasing this, and fully expected to use it.  I can happily say that I have not had any trouble with it.  I have this game for both the PS4 and my PC and I can comfortably recommend it for either system.  If you have any doubts about whether your PC can run it though, I'd suggest just springing for the PS4 version to be on the safe side.  My PC specs are:CPU:  i5-4690GPU:  MSI GTX 970 (Nvidia)RAM:  8 GB1 TB Hard Drive - Not SSDGamepad:  Xbox One Wireless controller for WindowsGame Settings:Full Screen1920x1080Anti-Aliasing: OnEffects:  HighShadows:  HighAmbient Occlusion: OffI'm not overclocking or anything like that and I run my computer power on Balanced mode.  I've had a few instances of frame rates dropping for a second or two, but it goes back up to full speed (60-ish).  I do have one minor gripe, a quirk with the mouse cursor not automatically disappearing when I use my controller, but moving it to the right edge of the screen is a simple enough solution.The 1920x1080 on fullscreen mode bug is still an issue, but the game still looks better than the PS4 version on my computer, so I can ignore it until a fix comes out.The game is an open-world(ish) action/hack-and-slash/rpg.  It is a smooth and fast paced combat system along the lines of Devil May Cry and God of War.The story telling and npc interaction really, really reminds me of the old Legend of Zelda games, though.  And the music also gives me that same sort of feeling that I had when playing those older jRPGs.It's worth buying, in my opinion, but if you have doubts, you can always rent it if you have a PS4 and try before you buy.

												Nier Automata.I love this game , I with held from buyig it because I saw that a lot of people complained about the poor PC port, especailly people with AMD cards.But I bought it anyways, at first it looked like crap yes, but come on guys, a quick search have led me to the FAR mode that fixed the game completely for me, gotten rid of the upscaling , improved my FPS , and the game is playable ++ for me.I'm only packing an i5 with a 280x graphic card and the game is running on 60 fps with everything on high.So for the game itself, it's amazing. I've gotten 35 hours and not even finished my first playthrough ( haven't reached the first ending as well )I love the characters, I love 2B especially because how she evolves from this stiff law following emotionless android to a caring and loving android.I love the story, I love the voice acting, I love the combat.This game is a must for me.

												So it seems like this is one of those games that runs well on some machines and not on others. Since on my PC it seems to run at smooth 60 fps (turned on MSI Afterburner to make sure) with some minor 2-5 fps (to 55 fps) dips on some enemy explosions, I have to rate it as running extremely well in my case. However there is something unique to my use case, which might indicate the problem. I am running the game on a 1680x1050 monitor (bet most of you don't have one of these 16:10 puppies), so the problem might include rendering 1080p or even 16:9 image or upsacling to certain resolutions, but who knows, not exactly my field. My default options were also kinda wierd, since it wasn't any of the presets, but it runs well I guess, albeit the X4 AA seems to do almost nothing (don't really care about the graphics too much anyway, but worth considering I guess), so maybe playing around with the options could help. Also there is a minor problem, which is that on 16:10 monitors the fullscreen option completely breaks. When fullscreen, the image will be rendered as if it was on a 16:9 display, which would be quite normal, but it renders at full height (without bars), meaning that some of the left screen space is literally not shown. Hence I am playing in windowed mode, which does work perfectly fine (but is not borderless, which screws with immersion a little bit). My rig (which is quite crapos in terms of it's CPU and mobo):ASUS STRIX 1060 GTX (6GB)AMD ATHLON II X4 651K (3Ghz Quad that is really old)8GB RAMMSI A75MA-P35 mobo (Again, really old)Windows 8.1 (Don't enjoy spyware)XBOX Controller (Not really the rig, but pertinent information)The game itself is extremely fun, though I am just starting out. It hasn't crashed at all, but there is no saving initially (haven't gotten so far) and I am playing it on Hard, which does kill you with 2 bullets or attacks with the exception of the Boss Bot, which can off you with one swing. The biggest tips I can give you is that when perspectives/control modes shift in flight mode, you can and must still shoot not to be flooded by bullets and the moment you land, the start button opens your menu which contains a ton of healing items, but I never saw the game tell me that. Here I go to replay that mission for whateverth time.Hope this info together with other reports helps clear up what's going wrong for other players and make your purchase decision. I guess if you have pretty much the same rig as me, it should be fine. Sorry for the grammar mistakes, I did type this out quickly since I want to keep playing. This had better have a good Yoko Taro story. >.<EDIT: Using Borderless Gaming as suggested by Gazda did fix the fullscreen issue, as long as I remember to get the mouse out of the way this is pretty much perfect. Also on perspective changes it can dip to 50s and even slightly sub that for a bit, not that I would notice without my FPS counter.			"

												I had to refund this. I cannot in good conscience recommend this in the state it is in right now. The game itself is amazing. An hour in and I'm already invested in the characters. However, this port is absolutely unacceptable. I wanted so badly to support Yoko Taro's game on PC, but not like this. *Ridiculous draw distance and unslightly pop-in everywhere (as others mentioned, entire buildings pop-in...)*Crashes are sporadic, though not -too- often for me personally(others can't even get past the start screen).*Fullscreen has a lot of issues, and seems to run at lower resolution than listed. 1080p isn't 1080p, etc.*No 4k support. Seriously, in 2017?*Antialiasing settings don't really have much effect visually.*Screenshots do not look like in-game on max settings.*Saving settings in the title screen has been glitchy for me, and will sometimes freeze the game.*Denuvo... although we all knew this going in.I could go on, but others have done a better job explaining than I have. I'm running the game on a GTX 1080, with an i7 3770k running at 5Ghz. I get better performance running The Witcher 3 or  Dues Ex: Mankind Divided in 4k than I do on this ps4 port.As it is now, I've refunded this game, and will consider repurchasing/recommending it when (if?) they polish these glaring issues. The port is the only thing holding back this gem of a game. This is not how you do a port. Not for $59. Very disappointing.			"

												I'm bought this game going in completely blind, just off of what a friend told me, the gameplay trailer and a webtoon i just read called Nanos List. (b.c androids). I'm enjoying it pretty solidly so far.Here are some things: - Quicksave where ever you can! I made that mistake, luckily really early. - Game runs pretty good! No fps lag so far, even with the huge boss/mini boss fights. - I usually love running a keyboard/mouse setup but I don't think I can with this game. I resorted to using my XB1 controller (runs pretty well! If you have Windows 10 you should already have the drivers installed, just plug the controller into a USB slot and enjoy.)- If you DO use a keyboard setup,  you're going to have to tweek it, how you tweek it is going to be your own preference. - Will add more helpful tips/tricks as I think of them!

												Each generation got their defining games.Ocarina of Time, Half-life, etc... they all marked a milestone in some ways.Nier : Automata is one of those games.It pushes the boundaries of video games in a manner we weren't imagining before.From the first to the last minute of this experience, the game will grab you and never let you go.You'll be sent into a rollercoaster of emotions, from the epicness of the action scenes to the sadness of some story scenes.It involves the player with real inventivity, using all means to make the player feel like a part of the game.And as always with this game franchise, it's technically beautiful, with on-point and gorgeous soundtracks.This is one of the most serious contender for GOTY at this moment and we can only hope that this game will receive its due reward.

												By far one of the best games I've had the pleasure of playing. I love the world that Yoko Taro created and am currently getting through my second full-game playthrough. As you play it, you can tell that the game was made with a lot of thought and care. The world feels lived in, and the way that the story unravels always leaves you wanting to continue. Positives: + Phenomenal Soundtrack+ Incredible in-game atmosphere from the get-go+ Amazing gameplay mechanics (Thank you Platinum Games)+ Compelling storyline and charactersNegatives:- Some players report frame-rate hiccups (try the unofficial patches!)- Some questing can take a long time (large maps to run back and forth through early on)Give it a shot if and when you get the chance!

												How can I describe this game...Absolutly one of the best games so far in the year, maybe in the last generation. Goty 2017 potential to be honest.Let me start saying that this game starts slow, the first hour or 2 to me were just a pain in the ♥♥♥ honestly. I dropped the game and start playing something else (thought on refunding), but then i start seeing all the hype on youtube and friends praying its story/gameplay/mechanics/rpg elements so I grew some balls and start playing it again. OHHHH boy! how wrong i was. Everything started to get intense, enemies getting stronger, the Story got so good that I slept only 4 hours for 2 days just to play this, couldn't think about anything else. After beating the story I went to rest, but now I do feel to do all the sidequest I left behind because all the lore that I feel I NEED to know since I didn't play the Yoko Taro's previous games besides this one. Recollect every Archive/Weapon just to know everything that this game has to offer.The only thing i need to say is that backgrounds were indeed beautiful, but i feel some things/details were lacking; buildings were kinda plain to me, shadows not so good for the current game generation, grass felt a little bit weird to me. But believe me, it won't damage your gameplay experience, just details that bothered, at least a little bit, to me.Pros:-Amazing OST, one of the best so far in videogames.-A really ♥♥♥♥ed up but amazing story with a HUGE character development.-A well driven futuristic-RPG mechanics.-Hack'n'Slash combat system-Balanced enemies and difficulty, it can be pretty easy for those who doesn't want a challenging game, or it could be worse than DS saga in Hard-Extreme Difficuly.-Open World (not so big nor small, just perfect for the game)-Good character design.-A2 and B2's A♥♥.Cons:-Visually it's indeed very beautiful, but kinda one of its weak points for me at least (not on pair with recent games).-Cinematics locked to 30 fps-Not the best PC port but it's playable.PD: Please, you can Indeed play this game with Keyboard and mouse as I did, but if you have a controller, please play with it.a 9.5/10 game			"

I'm loving the game and I love how hardcore it is. Quite a challenge. I like it and I hope the devs will soon address the few issues. Don't be discouraged by people wrongfully voting the game.

												UPDATE - I'm still leaving this to not recommended for the time being until it is patched, but there is a work around for the blank screen on AMD RX 400 series cards. First, do a clean install with Display Driver Uninstaller. Make sure to do it through safe mode, and you might want to create a backup / system restore just in case. Link here. https://www.guru3d.com/files-get/display-driver-uninstaller-download,1.htmlNext, install driver 16.11.15 - http://support.amd.com/en-us/download/desktop/previous/detail?os=Windows%2010%20-%2064&rev=16.11.5#You should be good to go then. there is some noticeable stuttering here and there with this temporary fix, but it's certainly better than not being able to play the game at all. ORIGINAL REVIEW BEFORE WORK AROUND - Needs to be patched. There is definitely an issue with getting a freeze into a blank/white screen (one time it was blue for me even) for different users with different hardware. Many, including myself, can barely get pass the first boss, and for some it happens straight from launch. It seems to be fairly across the board for AMD users currently, despite Square Enix claiming its driver 17.2.1, and there are reports of it happening from Nvidia users. I have an RX 480 8gb personally, and have tried different drivers and messing around the settings and it still happened despite my efforts. It is unplayable due to this issue.There is also the issue of fullscreen not properly displaying, instead displaying a much lower resolution. For me I use 1920x1080, and it seems to be displaying in 1600x900 or so leading to desaturation and stretched images  or black bars. It can be worked around with the Borderless Gaming program, but Borderless Gaming does put in some input lag which is not ideal for a game such as Nier: Automata. This needs to be fixed as well.			"

												This is a great game that you should play if you have the time. Why? That has been covered by other reviews so I am going to focus on people who are worried that this is a sequel and they are going to miss out.Yes this is technically the 4th game in the Drakengard Series (Drakengard 3 -> Drakengard 1 -> Nier Gestalt/Replicant -> Nier Automata) but it plays a significant time after Nier Gestalt/Replicant thus you will not miss out on anything significant. The Main Story(s) of this game is fully enjoyable without any prior knowledge but there will be anecdotes and small mentions of previous games, mainly Nier Gestalt/Replicant. So if you dont want to miss out on those little things play the games or watch a summary on youtube, but it definitely isnt necessary. Altough I definitely would recommend at least watching a summary of Nier Gestalt/Replicant and watching the cutscenes, it will enhance your enjoyment of the game.Now go and enjoy this amazing game.

												Nier Automata is nothing short of a masterpiece, period. Despite it's flaws I can't think of it as anything but one. Story, Gameplay, Characters. Sound, Music, Graphics (though lacking at times). Expectations i had for this game had been thoroughly smashed with a hammer, a long with many emotions pertaining in my head. Nier Automata begs the question 'What does it mean to live? To be human? To be yourself?' in one of the most fascinating ways from start to finish.This is game that I believe everyone needs to play, or otherwise watch if you enjoy let's plays. It is something that has lifted pressure off my shoulders and made me look forward to the future.It is a very important game. A very life changing game in my opinion.On another note: Thank you Weii (Not sure if I got the name right) for guiding me to the end. "

												Yoko Taro's approach to storytelling is like increasing the temperature of a hot tub by 1 degree at a time. You won't notice the difference until you look down after 30 hours and realize you're in a pool of lava. Only then will you realize you actually prefer lava.Each Drakengard game starts with a simple and relatable premise: Man and dragon fight evil empire. Father wants to find a cure for his sick daughter. And NieR: Automata, at its surface level, is about androids battling machine-servants of aliens while humanity takes refuge on the moon. If it sounds like your typical JRPG sci-fi story, congratulations: You've fallen into Taro's trap. To call the events of the game a mindf**k is both accurate and a disservice. It implies a lack of meaning or direction, when in reality you're given everything you need in order to understand the story; it just might not come in the order you like. Not only is the main story an enigma that leaves you hungry for more details, but even the sidequests add important context to the events of the story, as well as having some seriously strong foreshadowing that you'll likely miss until you're thinking in retrospect. And that's the real beauty of a Taro story: it keeps you occupied for weeks after you finish the game as you slowly stumble upon epiphanies, information the game gave you clear as day but that your brain failed to piece together until it was too late. After several of these moments you'll come to not only love the game, but respect the writers as intellectual superiors that played you like a damn fiddle while, somehow, respecting your intelligence at the same time. If you've played a JRPG in the past, you know that there is often a trifecta of qualities and you have to pick two and only two: graphics, gameplay, and story. If a game has great graphics and gameplay, it usually has a bad story (Bayonetta, DMC, etc.). If it has a fantastic story, it usually either has bad gameplay or bad graphics (Xenoblade). The pattern so far for Drakengard has been good story, decent gameplay, and bad graphics. However, they've teamed up with Platinum Games this time, who's known for great gameplay, good graphics, and bad story. Combined, they've managed to cover each other's flaws beautifully. This game is a treat to look at, the gameplay is fun as hell, and the story is some of Taro's best work yet.I can't remember the last time I had so few complaints about a game, and I'm an incredibly harsh critic of games (especially ones that I love). Throughout NieR: Automata, I kept thinking ""what's the catch?"" There has to be a really terrible part coming up soon, right? No game goes this long without any glaring issues. That point never came, though.If you've never played Drakengard, you'll probably still have a great time with this game. If you've played most of the series up to this point, it's a masterpiece.			"

												I am 8 hours in only, and I feel like I am barely scratching the surface.... the game is immensly huge in this sense but it can do repetative stuff, get ready for some backtracking, afterall it has a bit of a JRPG feeling to it.The game feels amazing, combat is fluid and fast paced, and tho the graphics are not the best you will see this year, the animations are flawless and they provide a real umph to the gameplay experience. Art Style is amazing as well top notch stuff there.I would probably advise getting a Controller for this game, however I do play right now on Mouse n Keyboard on Normal difficulty, but i do not use the lock on feature. A bit of tweaking of settings and you can enjoy it even with kb&mShould you buy it? If you like SHMUP, JRPG, Action RPG, Brawler, and even Platformer elements in one package, then go right ahead, dont hesitate, there are many game types squashed into this but they are all made with good care, and are not unnatural to this game.Probably the most Unique game this year.EDIT: Just finished Ending (A) took me approx 20 hours, more endings to reach, this game is insanely good, i stand firmly with the recommendation of it, its more than worth a buy.

												I have one word for this game, beautifulFrom the sound design, character design, gameplay and story all come together to make a truly beautiful game. I don't often write reviews but i felt like I had to after such an epic experience as it tackles complex topics we all battle with like ""why are we here?"" ""what is our purpose?"" and ""what is worth fighting for?"" and never giving up (especially if you are playing on harder difficulties). By the time I had reached the final ending I was in tears with all the emotions this game had me feel and the fact that i had wrapped it up with the final goodbye hit me hard. This game will have a special place in my heart and I urge everyone who loves a great rpg experience or any gamer for that matter to pick up this masterpiece. This is my game of the year so far and i know we are early into 2017 but it's gonna be tough to beat that's for sure. When a game managers to pull your heart strings and engage all your emotions that imo is when it is no longer just a game but a piece of art, and this is truly a masterpiece			"

												I got this game on day one and was hoping it would be awesome and in no way has it let me down yet. I am absolutely loving it so far and the story has actually got me questioning my actions in the game. every moment is a wtf moment and the switch up of genre in game makes it so friggin intense especially at the boss stages. bullet hell,top down, side scrolling, flight, rpg, hack n slash and more. Its worthy of the praise ive seen so far even if the graphics arent on par with those of todays games its no big deal as graphics dont make a game great they just act as a bonus. Its also a massive change of pace from all these first person horrors and shooters and survival games coming out. if i was rating it id give it 9/10 in my opinion. but then nothing is perfect. I would say buy and see for yourself and if not then you can always get a refund. Oh and for the voice acting sometimes its lacking but over all its pretty good and there is many side quests worth doing to boost your character. As i said give it a bash.			"

												NieR: Automata is one of the few games that I have played that offer one of the best soundtracks. Be mindful that the director is Yoko Taro, so this game may not be for the faint of heart. It's storyline is pretty good as it references back to NieR and even parts of Drakengard. There are a total of 26 different endings, but only 5 of them are important. The game is very good, however I feel as if it could be better. The rest of the endings acts as a comic relief. With all that being said, here are my pros and cons of this game.Pros: - Soundtrack - Supports xinput (xbox controller) - Debug mode (unlocked after beating the game) - Good learning curve - Physics for hair and outfits are pretty good for most times, but it can be approved. - A lot of the side-quests are actually interesting - Requires some skills to play (similar to Devil May Cry series) - Combat is pretty addicitive - Plenty of comic reliefs in this game, which is great so you won't have to feel so depressed - Awesome animations - Sexy asf androids - Ok balance in difficulties, but it could be better. - Adjustable difficulty - Hacking mini-game is pretty fun and simple (only on 9S) - The alternation between hack-and-slash and bullet-shooter is awesome - Weapon stories are really fun and entertaining to read (makes upgrading each and every one of them worth it) - English voice acting is pretty good for something made in Japan.Cons: - Scaling issues (gets annoying after a while of seeing your screen blink so many times on startup) - Requires a decent computer. (In my case, this wasn't a problem, but I know not everyone has a high range computer) - Frames may slow down during scenes - Post-game is way too easy (enemy levels do not scale with player level, but rather with how far you're into the story. For example, once you beat the game and go back to an early part of the game such as chapter 2, your character may be level 70 and the robots will be like level 5) - Pod materials are way too hard to find. (Couldn't upgrade my pods until second playthrough) - Fishing is awesome, but trying to 100% the fishing encyclopedia is a pain. - As mentioned above, difficulty balance could be better. Balance is only good up until mid-late game (Around level 50). After that, everything becomes way too easy to kill. - As mentioned, physics for hair and outfit are pretty good, but if you were to observe closely at times, it looks like the hair/outfit twitches. - Animal bait is pretty much useless after you get a specific item - Pod C is only useful in Hard or Very Hard mode because of it's capabilities to lock on to targets. Other than that, you're better off using Pod A or Pod B. - The 3D map can be a bit hard to read sometimes, but the game will literally tell you to just suck it up and get use to it (gotta love Yoko Taro lol) - Lock on camera can get somewhat buggy if you're fighting in a cluster of enemies (only in normal and below difficulties).If you want to truly appreciate this game and get the most out of it, my tip would be to do all the side-quests and unlock all the archives. The side-quests in this game are probably one of the best. They aren't your average ""collect X amount of this and receive X EXP and X potions"". A lot of them have very interesting stories to them that deal with machines/androids. You may find them sad, tragic, funny, or cool. Although you don't have to play NieR or Drakengard 1/2/3 to understand NieR Automata, it would be just a bit better know some lore, as the archives and weapon stories reference back to NieR and Drakengard.

												Okay, game. You got me.That was a surprisingly cool ending considering you spent about an entire ~40 hour playthrough raising my expectations of how cool and surprising the next chapter would be over and over. Now, to try and review this game as part of its series would probably out of my ability since I never played any of the other prequel games in this franchise which, from what I understand, spans half a dozen titles of the same quality and lenght as the latest Nier: Automata, In fact, the more time I spent on the game wiki reading about the backstory, the more I was convinced I needed to stop before I would innevitably end up comming back to my senses at 4am on a work week, exhausted, emotional and with more questions about the story than ever before.That said, as a stand-alone experience, Nier: Automata was enjoyable AF. The gameplay is very fast paced and the controls are precise and responsive. The levels and boss fights are varied, inventive and the good kind of challenging. The beautiful dynamic soundtrack is top notch. The graphics are very serviceable for a console port but the art and animations frankly embarass the crap out of some of its contemporary 2017 AAA titles I won't name. And finally, the story, while convoluted, confusing and very japanese (and I mean that in a grudgingly fond way), is still enjoyable and manages to build some great emotional attachment to the cast of characters by the end. Just don't expect Pixar so turn your brain off a little for maximum effect.The fighting could seem repetitive at first if you didn't try different weapons and combos that have different bonus effects and animation moves. The chip system would also have you farm the crap out of some areas hoping to get those elusive diamond grade chips to fuse into the ultimate final form. The game also has very respectable replay value thanks to interesting side chainquests that aren't just your run of the mill fetch-me-12-boar-tusks or climb a tower to unlock the map but rather meander into more interesting stories and take you to gorgeous hidden spots with their own unique challenges that I'd never have found on my own.There's something to be said about games that rely on replaying the same level more than once to get the full story but honestly, this game never felt lazy for a second, which is something that's very difficult to achieve in open world games because after the gaming industry has evolved to where it stands today, we've come to have very high expectations and it doesn't take that much to break our enjoyment anymore. Yet, in Nier: Automata, everywhere I looked, everytime I prod in an unintended direction, every tire I kicked, I could see the evidence of the passionate artists who licked every surface and facet with madenning attention to detail.Lastly, there're a few technical issues with full screen performance and the hacking minigame controls using kb/m right now but I expect those to ironed out and there are already community fixes available. Generally, the game run perfectly on my aging 780ti.Rock solid 8/10.			"

												Holy crap what can I say about this game.First off, just the gameplay.  It goes from a hack and slash to a arcade style shoot-em-up to a mech fighting game and then to a side scroller and then top down game.It makes even the most routine fighting scenes immensly entertaining.Second, the story.  I'm not going to go into much detail because the amount of twists and turns and moments that just make you pause the game to sit and think for a little are all the little things that just make this game great.All in all, if you are looking for something different but will keep you coming back, get this game.

												I don't like RPGs much and I was hoping for a Platinum game. But the advantage of Nier Automata is that, if you're just here for a story, the game practically plays itself. Once I got bored of the combat, I flipped on easy mode and powered through the story because I literally could not handle not knowing what happens next. The story is indeed that good, and it has that Yoko Taro twist to it. If you're into jRPGs with Kingdom Hearts combat, this is a must play.			"

												I originally reviewed this game after beating the first playthrough. I've now completed all the main endings so I feel I can give a more accurate review.NieR: Automata is the story of androids 2B, A2 and 9S as they struggle to understand what's going on in a world infested with machine lifeforms. Platinum Games had a heavy involvement and as you'd expect, the combat system is extremely well thought out and fluid. While occasionally the camera can be a bit problematic, generally the game plays very well as it switches between action RPG hack-and-slash and various shooter/bullet hell genres.The initial play through (Route A) takes around 10 hours if you ignore some of the sidequests. After its completion, the game will tell you that the game is expected to be played a few times through for different endings. I would strongly suggest playing through Endings A to E; the remaining ones are largely joke ones.The music by MONACA and Keiichi Okabe is amazing throughout and perfectly captures the atmosphere of vain hope and sadness that resonates throughout the main story.The real strong point of the game is the story and the emotional attachments you forge with the characters, which makes the different story routes all the more impactful. Without spoiling anything, you want to be aware that this is a pretty hard-hitting game and it's almost as if Yoko Taro delights in making the player suffer.To anyone considering the game, please at least play Routes A, B and then C/D/E (the latter three don't take long). Only then will you fully understand what's going on in the world. By just completing A and B (like many magazine/websites have), you barely get to know anything.The PC port has some issues (1080p actually just upscales 900p so it looks blurry unless you use a Borderless Window program) and it can sometime drop frames / stutter / freeze briefly even on good machines. Once these are sorted out, it'll leave a game that I consider to be a real contender for one of the greatest games ever.Genuinely, I haven't played a game this good in years and thoroughly recommend it...if you're prepared for being hit right in the feels, over and over again.Amazing game.

												In a few words, this game is amazing.Fun Hack n' Slash gameplay with tight controls, very difficult and unforgiving game, mainly so in the prologue, I don't recommend starting it on hard, it's a game that, unless you're used to the genre you should start in Normal or easier, if you're absolutely incompetent, don't worry, the game can be very accessive by enabling chips that basically play the game for you.The story, though, now that's the thing, this game has 5 true endings, unlike other games you don't start the game all the way over to get the different endings, each and every play through is truly different from the previous one, either by introducing a different playable character or more story elements, so if you're afraid of getting burned out by starting a new game+, don't be, try it out first, it's a whole new thing.This game can be very depressing, be it via the main story or it's side quests. Sometimes it will throw you something that gives you hope, but most of the time, it will try to crush you, make you question your existence and objectives and I love it. This game said something that I've always thought about, it connected to me in a very deep level, so I hanged on, 'till the very last true ending, ending E......that ending really gives you hope to keep on, no matter how hard it gets.Oh, and to the person who I gave up all my time and effort to help! Life can be quite the ♥♥♥♥♥, it might be meaningless and you will suffer a lot, but so what? Memory wasn't made for us to remember or good times, it's there so we don't repeat our mistakes. Suffering and hardship makes us stronger, if we can get past it! Time is only wasted if you think it is, when you do the things you love, that isn't wasted time, nah, that's called 'time well spent'.So struggle, scream, cry and fight, even if it's all really meaningless and futile, because isn't it fun, to hang on to this tiny hope, to deny when life it says to give up, to fight the impossible? I know I love it and I wouldn't have it any other way, so hang on, I'm here with you, even if you think you're alone.			"

I hope for an official fix asap.for those wanting the game, keep it in your cart and wait for the official fix. Game is really really worth it.EDIT 1: I take my words back, the game is super unpredictable. First it will run as good as any other game then the next it doesn't even launch, it just hangs in the Task Manager and then it will show up in the Task Manager and just disappear. I honestly wouldn't buy this game right now as a patch hasn't even been mentioned from the devs ever since release. F.A.R is a good fix if your game is launching but even that isn't a solid guarantee. I will still recommend the game from the gameplay experience I have done but other than that, the issues are varieble and annoying and will end up spending hours trying to get the game to launch only for your game time to become void for a refund as you've spent more than 2 hours or countless days trying to get it to work.

												This game is a masterpiece in every way possible.The story is fascinating from the very first moment, and it has solid hack and slash gameplay with a lot of abilities and tricks to it as you would expect from a game like this.Though what really keeps you in your chair for hours straight are the characters, their development and relations.All of them are well written and have a really unique personality. You just want to stick with them till the end and see what their fate will bring.The way the story is presented is also really unique. The route system let's you think you beat the game, yet you have beat only the first route and with every route new mechanics are introduced and the gameworld changes in certain ways.This way the game kept me amazed and surprised even after i've beat the first two routes.Whilst i was half way through the game someone asked me wheter or not this game was worth the buy and i said that it was probably my favorite gaming experience 2016/17, now that i have basically finished the main story i can confidently say that it is probably my favorite gaming experience of all time, that NieR:Automata will always have a special place in my heart and that it deserves the GOTY award.Also this is the first time that i picked up a game OST for 16€, and found myself watching the entire credits just to listen to a song in fact i might even buy the disc version of the OST once it is released.

												Besides the random crashes this game is as solid as can be.Amazing visualsAmazing fighting mechanicsAmazing musicHUGE bossesand 2B's booty ofcosI can't comment on the Story as the following will explain;I wish I could just surpass the first boss so I can save cos as of this moment, the crashing is preventing me from progressing further than the first boss. I hope for an official fix asap.for those wanting the game, keep it in your cart and wait for the official fix. Game is really really worth it.EDIT 1: I take my words back, the game is super unpredictable. First it will run as good as any other game then the next it doesn't even launch, it just hangs in the Task Manager and then it will show up in the Task Manager and just disappear. I honestly wouldn't buy this game right now as a patch hasn't even been mentioned from the devs ever since release. F.A.R is a good fix if your game is launching but even that isn't a solid guarantee. I will still recommend the game from the gameplay experience I have done but other than that, the issues are varieble and annoying and will end up spending hours trying to get the game to launch only for your game time to become void for a refund as you've spent more than 2 hours or countless days trying to get it to work.

												Nier Automata.I love this game , I with held from buyig it because I saw that a lot of people complained about the poor PC port, especailly people with AMD cards.But I bought it anyways, at first it looked like crap yes, but come on guys, a quick search have led me to the FAR mode that fixed the game completely for me, gotten rid of the upscaling , improved my FPS , and the game is playable ++ for me.I'm only packing an i5 with a 280x graphic card and the game is running on 60 fps with everything on high.So for the game itself, it's amazing. I've gotten 35 hours and not even finished my first playthrough ( haven't reached the first ending as well )I love the characters, I love 2B especially because how she evolves from this stiff law following emotionless android to a caring and loving android.I love the story, I love the voice acting, I love the combat.This game is a must for me.

												This game is Amazing! I'm releaved that it became as good as I hoped it to be. I loved NieR: Replicant/Gestalt and Automata comes around the corner and manages to become even better. The gameplay is solid. The graphics look good most of the times. And the OST, OH GOD THE OST! It's so effing good! If you loved the OST of the first game then you most likely will adore this one! There are only 2 things that are ""bad"" about this game. Some players can't even play it (Thank god this didn't happen to me) and the other is that it really is missing a native borderless window, because in fullscreen it lookes weirdly streched.But all together I would give this game a 9.5/10. This games isn't just one of my recent favourites, but it has become one of my all time favourite games. Giving a crazy japanese guy the resources for this was a great decision!			"

												Dark Souls esque spectacle fighter with Twin Stick and Vertical scroller shooter elements!This game is superb.The story telling is wonderful, and the voice acting is some of the best I have ever heard.Fast paced, difficulty is balanced well (I played on hard, but not hardest)Character customization in terms of mechanics with switchable loadouts that are 100% customizable was great.Can have builds for offense, defense, and everything in between.

												I saw this game described as a masterpiece and have to agree with that idea because the amount of effort put into all aspects of its design is clear when playing. It's refreshing to see a game have a world that's so thought out that the many optional quests actually add a lot to the story/message (developing characters, organizations, etc). I particularly liked seeing various machines pick up individual components of humanity in isolation and seeing what problems being emotionally incomplete/imbalanced caused, especially when the emotions were relatable.Without going into more detail, I'll say that I appreciate the designers' playfulness and creativity (even with minor things like adjusting game settings). It feels like they go the extra mile and end up making experiences that dramatically stand out from how other games are.But for me, someone whose favorite genre of music is videogame music, that's where this game shines most. I loved the original NieR soundtrack and had been excited about this game's soundtrack for months. It ended up shattering my expectations and impressed me immensely. The tracks for the main areas in the game have at least four versions, so the music stays fresh and extra interesting. Sometimes vocals will be highlighted/emphasized and other times there will be more instruments or a faster pace. I'm excited that I'll have both relaxation and energy music for so many songs. And more than I get from other game soundtracks, many of the songs in this have moments that stand out as amazing with tracks that build to them wonderfully. If you're on the fence about buying this game, consider checking out the soundtrack as part of your decision. It keeps playing in my head, and that's wonderful.I ended up having to upgrade my graphics card (formerly a GTX 650) to play this game, but the environment was stunning with a GTX 1060. Lighting, particles in the environment, and the incredible level of detail in textures made me feel like I was in the real world. I ended up dedicating four consecutive days to playing this game and my immersion made it feel like I left the real world for that time. And with adjustable difficulty and a system that lets you go back and do/get things that you missed, I'll play it more in the future.After so long, I didn't expect NieR to get a sequel, but I get the feeling that the designers had been flushing their ideas out for much of the wait. There are callbacks to the original game that made me wish that I had replayed it shortly before playing this one so that I could understand the callbacks completely, but this game is complete independent of it, and knowledge of the first game isn't necessary for a great experience.I hope your experience of this game brings you as much joy as it brought me :)			"

												This isn't a real review - because well frankly - it'd be wasted. If you're looking at this game you already know what it is and the fact that as a game - it's a good game.The only reason you'd be here is to see if it's a good port to the PC or not.So...it's OK. Keyboard works really well. I have a controller but actually find the keyboard and mouse to work better - in part due to me being far more used to it.As far as performance goes - it runs just fine for me - with AA off windowed - which well is kinda lame but functional.

												Nier: Automata is a fantastic game. It has a good story, gorgeous music. In addition, Platinum brought a great play through experience for this game. If you are a fan of JRPG and act games, you should not miss this game. I played through this game on PS4 pro and bought it for the valve accessary. Well the pc port is not very good though, but if you have a good graphic card you can get a much better graphic than ps4 pro . Currently the full screen mode works wired, hopefully there will be a patch to fix that.			"

												For what I've played the game is great, story is good and characters are great. The gameplay is awesome (playing with a controller) and the music is simply beautiful. Sadly the port is terrible. My PC is far from shady ( I7 2600, 1070 GTX and 16GB DDR3, game is on a SSD) and I have frame drop when running it at max settings. The only other game that I have frame drops is project cars that is far more beautiful and the drops are less important, also cinematics are laggy and the draw distance is terrible. The worst is that the full screen is broken, seriously Square enix !? At first I thought it was because of my 21:9 screen but seems like I'm not the only one with the problem.			"

While we were there we went to a restaurant where I had the best pulled pork sandwich I have ever eaten in my life. In fact, I was quite sad when I was done eating it. This game is that pulled pork sandwich my friends.With a compelling story as usual from Yoko Taro, a god-tier soundtrack, and superb combat/gameplay mechanics thanks to Based Platinum, you wind up with my personal game of the year. Maybe even of the decade. I highly recommend to almost anyone to pick this up. As long you have the specs to run it that is. 11/10 butt of the year			"

												I had problems with fps at start, and I disliked the ""start at the very beginning if you fail tutorial"" weirdness.But...Nier:Automata turned out to be one of the most wholesome games ever.Gameplay is amazing, stories are both funny and heart wrenching and designs are beautiful.Those who are tired of meta narratives, beware, this is one of them.Do you really need to attack everything that attacks you? Is sating your curiosity always worth it?Are the rules given to you for purpose or not? What do you do with absolute choices that are all equally bad?Nier tries to make you tackle these questions yourself, sometimes forcefully, sometimes by only giving hints to them being there.Also the thing that made Dark Souls and Undertale stories stick on people is rising again.The mechanics are part of narrative. People, please try to make more games like that, it is what makes games a great storytelling media when used right!But I'll just say, play Nier:Automata, you can play this game even with lower end graphics cards if you fiddle with their settings enough.And Yoko Taro, you drunken ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I LOVE YOU, please be yourself until the very end.

												Came into this game with extremely high expectations set by the first NieR and the Drakengard series (particularly DoD3, the latest release.) Was not disappointed and, arguably, found a better experience than the first NieR. Seven hours into a semi-open world RPG is not enough to accurately say whether it will or will not try to pull the multi-genre stunts that NieR did, but so far it has done a fantastic job of focusing the gameplay.The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic, as we have come to expect from this game. The game does a good enough job at level design to hide an actually fairly short render distance, though I have sometimes experienced the smallest of texture popping. Nothing unreasonable. Playing on a controller, the controls are responsive and fluid; I've not seen any dropped inputs nor laggy ones (effectively meaning I only have myself to blame for bad timing for any mistakes.) The voice acting isn't award winning by any means, but works for the tone of the game and VAs seem to have appropriately nailed when hamming it up is necessary VS when actual serious dialogue is being spoken. Machines, however, may prove to be grating on your ears.Combat has a low skill floor with a high skill ceiling, allowing casual players to enjoy the combat while also allowing the more extreme veterans to really go to town with combination attacks, dodges and Pod use. You have the ability to take on enemies twice your own level, albeit through a bit of a slog, as long as you're proficient in dodging and weaving in and out of enemies. Movement controls are tight and I'm pleased to report that jumping doesn't seem ""floaty"" which was something I thought the game might suffer from based on trailers alone. Flying sections so far never overstay their welcome, though I would class as less enjoyable than the rest of the game overall. The map is frankly confusing - to the point they even have an in-story claim that the map has received complaints. Humorous to see, and yet not something I'm willing to forgive it for, either. Not unreadable, but a headache. Similarly, fullscreen resolution for 1920x1200 is broken, presently meaning you may have to play in windowed mode. The game also suffers a common problem of low framerates in pre-rendered cutscenes and while it doesn't drop frames during actual gameplay, it noticably stutters when having to load in areas, and I'm on a top end i7 6400 and Nvidia GTX 1070 Founder's Edition so I'm having neither CPU or GFX card issues. The stutters aren't impactful however, and considering the game drops literally no frames anywhere else and runs a smooth 60, I'm overall a happy campter. (Please also note: 60FPS cap on the game.)Won't comment pre-emptively on story simply because I am not that far into it, but based on all past experiences with this franchise, I'm in for one hell of a weird ride and I couldn't be more excited for it.

There are easy fixes for that in forums and I believe they will soon release an update fixing all the problems people might have.In conclusion: it is one of the best (if not the best) game I've played so far in 2017.

												This review is for you out there, wondering if you should buy it at 60$. You heared about some PC issues, you heard about some great soundtrack and you just don't know.I was like you just a few days ago. reading reviews over and over, thinking if it's worth my time.Well, from the moment I started I knew this game is special. The atomosphere was just great, along with voice acting and soundtrack right off the begining.Cons:1. PC isusses like full screen resoulation- can be easily fixed with community mod free to download2. crashed for me around 3 times in 10 hours of play.3. much more fun with controller (I bought xbox 360 controller for this game, plugged to my PC)Pros:1. Combat is really fun. Like really really fun.2. Most wierd and intersting story I've seen so far. and Im only starting to scratch it now3. Atmosphere. Game depth. There is a true soul and thinking behind everything in this game4. It is almost like art, a masterpiece. Not some other Ubisoft soulless game like watch dogs 2 or wildlands. THIS GAME HAS A SOUL.Seriously, buy it. Buy it before you buy anything else, and buy a controller. Trust me, you won't regrat it.Edit: At the end of the first playthrough I started crying.			"

Where each new environment and musical score - and man the soundtrack is amazing - whacks you in face. As of writing this I'm barely four hours in, and ready to pull an all nighter. That wow factor. It's strong in this one.Sure. There are a fair few technical issues. But seriously, nothing that a clever little gamer like yourself can't sort out. Yep. Instead writing volumes about the masterpiece Square Enix has put together - I'm just going to tell you to suck it up and fork out the cash.

												So far I'm enjoying this game, if you played the first one it hits you hard when you see things reappear that were from the first game, the weapons being the most noticeable I can say without going into spoilers, The combat has gotten much much better compared to the first one, granted it's still small combos but it's much faster and easier to pull off. And the story so far is still just as depressing as ever. and I love it. If you are a fan of the first one or even a fan of Dragkengarud I would say pick this game up.If you are new to this, give it a shot and see if you like it.

												This game is wierd, and I don't mean because of the story or because its Japanese.So I am a big Platinum fan and enjoyed most of their work even from back before they became independant from Capcom. As for Nier and Drakengard, well my knowledge of those games basically comes from watching Clemps' summary, btw hes youtube channel is great, check it out if you need some background on the world of this game.I came into this for the Platinum gameplay experience and on that front I was dissapointed. While this game is deffinately fun to play, due to it's length and lack of variety things gets pretty repetitive quite quickly.Now the story on the other hand while not quite the same tone as most Platinum games, is VERY good. Even if mostly non-sensical it will strike a cord with most gamers on an emotional level. I can now see why Yoko Taro's games have such a cult following.This leaves me very conflicted because I played this game for one thing and ended up enjoying it for another.Do you like sories that resonate on an emotional level (maybe not so much on a logical level)?Are you a fan of Yoko Taro's previous work?You should deffinately play it!If you are looking for 'dat Platinum feel'? Maybe try it out but this game is not quite that.  "

												2 weeks after its release, the game is still unplayable for GTX 700 series owners (and possibly RX 480 and noticed some GTX Titan complains here and there), it's still brimming with technical issues and poor optimization across platforms (poorly optimized for consoles which carried over and brought even more problems for the PC version).It's an action game and, given that the game's engine is bound to the framerates you can get, attaining 50+ or solid 60 is mandatory for the enjoyment of the game. And that makes the poor optimization that results to framedrops (no matter its source) worse than it is in any other game.2 weeks later, no patch yet to be seen. Imagine paying for a game you found you cannot complete due to crashing, and have to wait for ""some day"" to be resolved. Imagine that you waited for that game for months, if not years if you were a fan of the Nier/Drakengard games.I cannot upvote this game on the grounds of ""it plays on other people's machines"". If you cannot approproately support the hardware diversity of the PC. I cannot believe this it the kind of treatment PC consumers receive from Platinum, after the work they did with Metal Gear Rising:Revengeance. Now I know which company's game I won't preorder again.			"

												I gave up on games years ago, with pathetic plots, lame social signalling and gameplay designed for 12 year olds (i.e. Americans), Dark Souls was the only game recently that got me going.This game got me going, and has been the most compelling experience I've had in years. It isn't as hardcore as it might have been but the execution is truly brilliant.Send devs in America and Europe a message - buy this at full price!			"

												If you are a fan of good gamplay/story/music, then this game will deliver. Do yourself a favor and go in blind as it is quite the ride. As for the state of the port, it could have been better. As of this review, the developers have taken notice to the buggy release, but no official patch has been released. Instead the FAR mod (developed by user Kaldaien) has done a great job of fixing up this release and solving the widespread resolution issues and other minor bugs.If you want a good time then get this game.

												I must start to say this game is amazing.When i first started this on high settings and everything on max  in fullscreen everything worked very nice, then i restarted the game to try a few things and suddenly i got micro stutter, but some minor changes discussed nearly everywhere sorted that.Played near 10 hours so far, turning every stone i can find killing most stuff i can see, i really enjoy this game.My specs are win 10, i7 3820, geforce 1060 6gb, 16gb ram, ssd.  running at 1920x1080 at high setting with AA and Vsync off every thing else is maxed, using borderless gaming app. keeps 58-60 fps most of the time, cutscenes that many complains about is running okay some micro stutter hardly noticble for me.Had zero crashes aswell. When this is patched I will really recommend this to everyone but as many know this is a hate or love game.Othervise if u hate fiddle with settings and such, wait a bit untill most is sorted and if u have an older pc say 9xx geforce and older u might wait aswell untill u are sure it will work correct, as for now i wouldnt start this game with a weaker setup.Edit: near 40 hours gameplay, zero crashes and the games is running smooth 99.9% of the time.

												It's good.A friend advertised this game to me as a ""bizarre japano-style trash movie: the game"" experience, as that seems to be the schtick of Yoko Taro, its director. Friendo wasn't wrong. The game is weird, most certainly Japanese, and has that certain charm of entertainment which exists for its own sake rather than to be a bestselling blockbuster.If what you heard about the game first is how amazing 2B's butt is, be assured that it's not only true (yay), but that the game's story, characters, atmosphere, artstyle, music, and gameplay come with an overall quality to match.

												I saw this game described as a masterpiece and have to agree with that idea because the amount of effort put into all aspects of its design is clear when playing. It's refreshing to see a game have a world that's so thought out that the many optional quests actually add a lot to the story/message (developing characters, organizations, etc). I particularly liked seeing various machines pick up individual components of humanity in isolation and seeing what problems being emotionally incomplete/imbalanced caused, especially when the emotions were relatable.Without going into more detail, I'll say that I appreciate the designers' playfulness and creativity (even with minor things like adjusting game settings). It feels like they go the extra mile and end up making experiences that dramatically stand out from how other games are.But for me, someone whose favorite genre of music is videogame music, that's where this game shines most. I loved the original NieR soundtrack and had been excited about this game's soundtrack for months. It ended up shattering my expectations and impressed me immensely. The tracks for the main areas in the game have at least four versions, so the music stays fresh and extra interesting. Sometimes vocals will be highlighted/emphasized and other times there will be more instruments or a faster pace. I'm excited that I'll have both relaxation and energy music for so many songs. And more than I get from other game soundtracks, many of the songs in this have moments that stand out as amazing with tracks that build to them wonderfully. If you're on the fence about buying this game, consider checking out the soundtrack as part of your decision. It keeps playing in my head, and that's wonderful.I ended up having to upgrade my graphics card (formerly a GTX 650) to play this game, but the environment was stunning with a GTX 1060. Lighting, particles in the environment, and the incredible level of detail in textures made me feel like I was in the real world. I ended up dedicating four consecutive days to playing this game and my immersion made it feel like I left the real world for that time. And with adjustable difficulty and a system that lets you go back and do/get things that you missed, I'll play it more in the future.After so long, I didn't expect NieR to get a sequel, but I get the feeling that the designers had been flushing their ideas out for much of the wait. There are callbacks to the original game that made me wish that I had replayed it shortly before playing this one so that I could understand the callbacks completely, but this game is complete independent of it, and knowledge of the first game isn't necessary for a great experience.I hope your experience of this game brings you as much joy as it brought me :)			"

												Okay, game. You got me.That was a surprisingly cool ending considering you spent about an entire ~40 hour playthrough raising my expectations of how cool and surprising the next chapter would be over and over. Now, to try and review this game as part of its series would probably out of my ability since I never played any of the other prequel games in this franchise which, from what I understand, spans half a dozen titles of the same quality and lenght as the latest Nier: Automata, In fact, the more time I spent on the game wiki reading about the backstory, the more I was convinced I needed to stop before I would innevitably end up comming back to my senses at 4am on a work week, exhausted, emotional and with more questions about the story than ever before.That said, as a stand-alone experience, Nier: Automata was enjoyable AF. The gameplay is very fast paced and the controls are precise and responsive. The levels and boss fights are varied, inventive and the good kind of challenging. The beautiful dynamic soundtrack is top notch. The graphics are very serviceable for a console port but the art and animations frankly embarass the crap out of some of its contemporary 2017 AAA titles I won't name. And finally, the story, while convoluted, confusing and very japanese (and I mean that in a grudgingly fond way), is still enjoyable and manages to build some great emotional attachment to the cast of characters by the end. Just don't expect Pixar so turn your brain off a little for maximum effect.The fighting could seem repetitive at first if you didn't try different weapons and combos that have different bonus effects and animation moves. The chip system would also have you farm the crap out of some areas hoping to get those elusive diamond grade chips to fuse into the ultimate final form. The game also has very respectable replay value thanks to interesting side chainquests that aren't just your run of the mill fetch-me-12-boar-tusks or climb a tower to unlock the map but rather meander into more interesting stories and take you to gorgeous hidden spots with their own unique challenges that I'd never have found on my own.There's something to be said about games that rely on replaying the same level more than once to get the full story but honestly, this game never felt lazy for a second, which is something that's very difficult to achieve in open world games because after the gaming industry has evolved to where it stands today, we've come to have very high expectations and it doesn't take that much to break our enjoyment anymore. Yet, in Nier: Automata, everywhere I looked, everytime I prod in an unintended direction, every tire I kicked, I could see the evidence of the passionate artists who licked every surface and facet with madenning attention to detail.Lastly, there're a few technical issues with full screen performance and the hacking minigame controls using kb/m right now but I expect those to ironed out and there are already community fixes available. Generally, the game run perfectly on my aging 780ti.Rock solid 8/10.			"

												I got this game on day one and was hoping it would be awesome and in no way has it let me down yet. I am absolutely loving it so far and the story has actually got me questioning my actions in the game. every moment is a wtf moment and the switch up of genre in game makes it so friggin intense especially at the boss stages. bullet hell,top down, side scrolling, flight, rpg, hack n slash and more. Its worthy of the praise ive seen so far even if the graphics arent on par with those of todays games its no big deal as graphics dont make a game great they just act as a bonus. Its also a massive change of pace from all these first person horrors and shooters and survival games coming out. if i was rating it id give it 9/10 in my opinion. but then nothing is perfect. I would say buy and see for yourself and if not then you can always get a refund. Oh and for the voice acting sometimes its lacking but over all its pretty good and there is many side quests worth doing to boost your character. As i said give it a bash.			"

												I recently discovered the 'NieR' series on a hunt for music/OSTs that were akin to 'Shadow of the Colussus'. A lone comment in a reddit thread lead me to the first 'NieR' album and was pleasantly surprised to learn that NieR: Automata had literally just launched. Compelled by the music of that first album, I decided to purchase the game and give it a whirl.Initially I was concerned that I would need to play 'Drakengard' or the original 'NieR' in order to fully appreciate the game, as I had not. The game stands alone perfectly, like a different house in the same neighborhood (thousands of years in the future).I won't spoil the plot for you (So I won't remark on characters, etc.), but please note that game's story plays out a bit different than most. Instead of a -very- long story, it's a tad bit shorter if you think of it in a linear fashion. However, the story is structured in such a way that you revisit the same story from a completely different angle in a truly varied way, and it feels quite different (thus far). It's NOT the typical: change Yes to No and Ending A becomes Ending B. It's nothing like that, you'll definitely want to keep playing.Good: Combat is fun, the customization is an interesting spin, the music is SUPERB. Controller combat wasn't bad, I thought I was going to hate it, but it works well. Try all the weapons, try all the abilities. This game isn't about min/max. The scenery is bleak feeling, but gorgeous.Bad: Fullscreen looks atrocious, but the windowed setting looks great. There isn't an auto-save, so be warned! I was hoping for a little more varied enemies, but it's not too bad.Things I wish I knew first: Use your POD target/lock on to allow for certain combos. All weapons are fun in their own way, it's worth trying them all and upgrading them all as you can. Don't worry about 'maxing' them on the first play through.Last thoughts: For purchasing on a whim, based on the music, I'm more than pleasantly surprised how fun it is. This game is fantastic. 9/10			"

												TL;DR Worth every 0.00001 of a penny (penny value may varies base on your region)STORY: Yoko Taro story is legendary as usual, dark theme with humour mixed in that you just can't find anywhere else. He'll randomly try to cheer you up as you progress along and holy hell do you need one sometimes. Think of it like you suffering through college and your uncle popping in once a while and give you a fluffy cat toy even though you don't have a cat.MUSIC&SOUND: music fit every part of the story and story fit every part of the music. Can't ask for anything more except for....well........more. GAMEPLAY: play it on Hard cuz you won't regret suffering through every bit of it. Not on ""very hard"" though, that's just sadisticGRAPHIC&DESIGN: Do you like explosion that was placed in for explosion sake? You'll get none of that here. Everything has it's place and purpose. Fanservice is also baked right into the character so there won't be a filler/fanservice episode/part of the story. Probably the only game that make me return to singleplayer after 10 years of pure multiplayer. It's just amazing of how much work goes into this. "

Although I can't exactly pin to specifics what is so great about NieR: Automata, I'll instead say that it's something one must play in order to understand.Definitely one I'll say ""Treasured Times"" to...

												Now that I have finished Ending A (the main ending) as well as part of B, I feel I am ready to review this game.I'm going to break up this review into 5 sectionsPlotCharactersControlsGameplayOptimizationPLOT-While some have labeled the plot as cliché (and I can see why), This is the first game in a while that had a story that I actually found myself wanting to continue and push further. It's a very odd tale that, while not as deep, reminds me of MGS. Plot 8/10CHARACTERS-The character design was... interesting. While everyone was gawking at 2B's butt, I was confused as to why they were blindfolded as they can see/operate fine without it. If video game characters are your cup of tea for 'certain viewing times' this game will please you. if not its kind of meh. The dialogue was pretty good, I heard both English and Japanese voice actors, and both settings were good (Japanese was better IMO for obvious reasons). I never thought that the characters were too talkaive, and they never seemed to get on my nerves. Characters 7/10CONTROLS-If you have a controller, use it. While the KB&M controls are not bad per se, they definitely could have been better. While the options do not apear to accept mouse controls for attacks, THEY ARE ALREADY MAPPED. It is very odd and never is noted that you can use your mouse, but that is much better than the alternative(Shift and /). Dodging got repetitve and isn't fun to perform (double tap a movement key). However I saw a mod that fixes this, I may pick it up. CONTROLS 6/10GAMEPLAY-Dear god is this game just an absolute blast to play. The combat is fluid and fun. the animations are incredible. There's tons of stuff to keep you occupied (Reportedly up to 45 hours). The Boss fights are a ton of fun, not being to easy, but not too difficult either. Exploring, Item hunting, side questing, and ...fishing, It's all a ton of fun. GAMEPLAY 10/10OPTIMIZATION-If you haven't heard, the port of this game is nothing to write home about. with an odd 1600x900 res lock, 60 fps lock/30 fps cutscene lock. Multiple people reported a whitescreen game crash after about 10 minutes(I was one of them) but rest assured, there are fixes to almost all of the problems. The Devs are also woking to fix the port up, but there is community mods to make this game more pc friendly. OPTIMIZATION 5/10TL;DR-This game is going to become a classic. This is easily my GOTY so far. Pick this gem up as soon as you can. If you manage to grab this on sale, you might as well be commiting theft. This game will stick with me for a long time, and I will be watching for Platinum's works from now on.OVERALL-9/10 GREAT			"

												I absolutely love this game. I have only completed the first playthrough so far, but I'm very excited for the rest.The story is interesting and weird (which, for any fan of the original Nier, was to be expected). I love the way the story is told through multiple playthroughs.The gameplay is fantastic. You have a light and heavy attack slot that you can put different weapons in. Which slot you put a weapon in determines the attacks (so the same weapon in different slots will function differently) so you can customize your attacks heavily based on which 2 weapons you are using.The only negative (other than the compatibility issues, see below) is the fact that most of the missions are pretty simple ""follow the marker"" stuff, but the story and the combat are more than enough to keep things interesting.It's so rare for me to be interested enough to stick with a single player RPG these days, but this is one I can't get enough of. Play it!Note: There are a few technical issues. The major issue that I ran into was fullscreen not running at the proper resolution. There are fixes for many of the issues available already (found in the steam forums).			"

												Calling this a ""game"" is insulting honestly. My time with Nier Automata is best described as: ""A beautifully crafted experience.""+An amazing story that ranges from heart-full, to heart-break+A soundtrack that is soothing and peaceful, or energetic and adrenaline-pumping+The controls feel fluid and fun, especially with all the changing perspectives and different styles of combat +Each time you beat the game, it introduces more curiosity and encourages another run through with the biggest twist of all being at the true ending +You get to have Moose friends and are able to ride them anywhere as your trusty steed(s)- You may have to tinker around with graphics and resolution settings a little - For some odd reason or another, you can kill your Moose friendsStop making me cry already/10    PS: Where was my free T-shirt when I pre-ordered?

												A great game hindered by the annoying no safe beginning area and for some pc port issues. Those 2 negatives get far outshined by the greatness of the rest tho! After getting used to the combat (By you guessed it, repeating the no save area) the game becomes incredibly fluid and fun. Dodging around doing combo's, parrying attacks and shooting powerfull lasers it all feels absolutly great. Now i have to say as well the game contains several gameplay modes like normal action mode, twin stick mode, 2d platformer mode and likely many more however i feel like some of them do not work well in the game but nevertheless these are mostly short sections so i can live with them.Audio and visually the game also does a decent job although some of the enviroments are visually lackluster but the soundtracks in every map definetly make up for any issues in that regard. About the story i can't say much yet since i havent finished it at this point. But overall i feel like this game is easily worth a buy.EDIT:Finished the story and i have to say this game really starts to shine when its all coming together at 2/3 of the game. If it wasn't for the enviroments and some repetitive aspects of the game then this game would have truly been a masterpiece.			"

												I’d like to start my review with a little story from my short playing session today:***When I play games on my PC I have two options:1) I play them on a 24“ monitor + a rather good speaker system2) I play them on my 40“ TV + a really good surround systemToday I went into a new area in the game while playing on my computer monitor, because I didn‘t want to switch on all that other equipment for a playing session that would only be rather short. End of story: I felt genuine regret! Not that it was a bad experience. Oh no, far from it! It was awe-inspiring. It‘s just that the visual and sound design in this game is ‚that‘ awesome.***Apart from that: The combat is satisfying, the story pulled me in right away and I so far enjoyed every single minute of gameplay!Oh, one more thing: I’m incredibly bad at action games. I usually only play turn-based stuff or very specific types of games that don’t require incredibly good reaction times. I’m so bad that I often have to quit games like this one after about two or three attempted battles. Luckily the lowest difficulty is just right for me, so that I can enjoy this awesome game. In this title boss fights are challenging, but not too difficult for me.You are good at action games and looking for a challenge? There are difficulty levels for everyone in this title.Overall there is no reason not to buy this game right now … except:The port is competent overall, but does have some severe technical problems. The worst of them ARE fixed by applying an unofficial fix (named ""FAR"": see the thread at the top of the forum) and using windowed borderless gaming, but IF you belong to that group of people who absolutely refuse to apply unofficial patches and use 3rd party tools: DO NOT GET THIS GAME NOW, BUT INSTEAD WAIT FOR A PATCH! (Sorry for the caps, but this is seriously important. That’s just how mandatory the fix is until this port gets patched.)I for my part use the fix and the borderless tool and I’m enjoying the hell out of this game.-----EDITS and additions after posting the review:Strictly speaking the game is playable without the fix and 3rd party tool, but usually a combination of the following can happen:- In fullscreen mode the resolution may be off (window mode has borders)- button prompts for the controller can be messed up in fullscreen mode- ingame cutscenes may stutter far below the 30 fps they were rendered in even on very performant hardware- on less potent hardware: without the FAR fix you don't have access to global illumination settings, which impact the performance heavily and the visual fidelity much less than other settings (even on a GTX 970 it may be difficult to maintain a steady 60 FPS in 1080p unless you either disable AA and AO. Toning down global illumination by only one level gives me roughly the same performance benefit that I can gain by entirely disabling both of those features.)			"

												Many games these days are very formulaic with multi-million dollar marketing campaigns. Developers try to borrow ideas from other successful games to incorporate into theirs. Games are created vanilla to appeal to a wide base to move as many copies as possible. Nier is a game with a clear vision in a sea of manufactured games. If you want a game with an engaging story, great music, and is most importantly, fun to play, this is for you.			"

Worth every minute, voice acting for the game is on point, story has some minor walls here and there but it flows through nicely after the multiple playthroughs, The soundtrack to this is simple breath taking. I wish the first Nier was on the steam store but beggers can't be choosers. Really should play this game, even if you have to try it from family sharing. PLay ThIS GaMe PLEase. 100/10			"

												Holy crap what can I say about this game.First off, just the gameplay.  It goes from a hack and slash to a arcade style shoot-em-up to a mech fighting game and then to a side scroller and then top down game.It makes even the most routine fighting scenes immensly entertaining.Second, the story.  I'm not going to go into much detail because the amount of twists and turns and moments that just make you pause the game to sit and think for a little are all the little things that just make this game great.All in all, if you are looking for something different but will keep you coming back, get this game.

												NieR: Automata is one of the few games that I have played that offer one of the best soundtracks. Be mindful that the director is Yoko Taro, so this game may not be for the faint of heart. It's storyline is pretty good as it references back to NieR and even parts of Drakengard. There are a total of 26 different endings, but only 5 of them are important. The game is very good, however I feel as if it could be better. The rest of the endings acts as a comic relief. With all that being said, here are my pros and cons of this game.Pros: - Soundtrack - Supports xinput (xbox controller) - Debug mode (unlocked after beating the game) - Good learning curve - Physics for hair and outfits are pretty good for most times, but it can be approved. - A lot of the side-quests are actually interesting - Requires some skills to play (similar to Devil May Cry series) - Combat is pretty addicitive - Plenty of comic reliefs in this game, which is great so you won't have to feel so depressed - Awesome animations - Sexy asf androids - Ok balance in difficulties, but it could be better. - Adjustable difficulty - Hacking mini-game is pretty fun and simple (only on 9S) - The alternation between hack-and-slash and bullet-shooter is awesome - Weapon stories are really fun and entertaining to read (makes upgrading each and every one of them worth it) - English voice acting is pretty good for something made in Japan.Cons: - Scaling issues (gets annoying after a while of seeing your screen blink so many times on startup) - Requires a decent computer. (In my case, this wasn't a problem, but I know not everyone has a high range computer) - Frames may slow down during scenes - Post-game is way too easy (enemy levels do not scale with player level, but rather with how far you're into the story. For example, once you beat the game and go back to an early part of the game such as chapter 2, your character may be level 70 and the robots will be like level 5) - Pod materials are way too hard to find. (Couldn't upgrade my pods until second playthrough) - Fishing is awesome, but trying to 100% the fishing encyclopedia is a pain. - As mentioned above, difficulty balance could be better. Balance is only good up until mid-late game (Around level 50). After that, everything becomes way too easy to kill. - As mentioned, physics for hair and outfit are pretty good, but if you were to observe closely at times, it looks like the hair/outfit twitches. - Animal bait is pretty much useless after you get a specific item - Pod C is only useful in Hard or Very Hard mode because of it's capabilities to lock on to targets. Other than that, you're better off using Pod A or Pod B. - The 3D map can be a bit hard to read sometimes, but the game will literally tell you to just suck it up and get use to it (gotta love Yoko Taro lol) - Lock on camera can get somewhat buggy if you're fighting in a cluster of enemies (only in normal and below difficulties).If you want to truly appreciate this game and get the most out of it, my tip would be to do all the side-quests and unlock all the archives. The side-quests in this game are probably one of the best. They aren't your average ""collect X amount of this and receive X EXP and X potions"". A lot of them have very interesting stories to them that deal with machines/androids. You may find them sad, tragic, funny, or cool. Although you don't have to play NieR or Drakengard 1/2/3 to understand NieR Automata, it would be just a bit better know some lore, as the archives and weapon stories reference back to NieR and Drakengard.

												Okay, game. You got me.That was a surprisingly cool ending considering you spent about an entire ~40 hour playthrough raising my expectations of how cool and surprising the next chapter would be over and over. Now, to try and review this game as part of its series would probably out of my ability since I never played any of the other prequel games in this franchise which, from what I understand, spans half a dozen titles of the same quality and lenght as the latest Nier: Automata, In fact, the more time I spent on the game wiki reading about the backstory, the more I was convinced I needed to stop before I would innevitably end up comming back to my senses at 4am on a work week, exhausted, emotional and with more questions about the story than ever before.That said, as a stand-alone experience, Nier: Automata was enjoyable AF. The gameplay is very fast paced and the controls are precise and responsive. The levels and boss fights are varied, inventive and the good kind of challenging. The beautiful dynamic soundtrack is top notch. The graphics are very serviceable for a console port but the art and animations frankly embarass the crap out of some of its contemporary 2017 AAA titles I won't name. And finally, the story, while convoluted, confusing and very japanese (and I mean that in a grudgingly fond way), is still enjoyable and manages to build some great emotional attachment to the cast of characters by the end. Just don't expect Pixar so turn your brain off a little for maximum effect.The fighting could seem repetitive at first if you didn't try different weapons and combos that have different bonus effects and animation moves. The chip system would also have you farm the crap out of some areas hoping to get those elusive diamond grade chips to fuse into the ultimate final form. The game also has very respectable replay value thanks to interesting side chainquests that aren't just your run of the mill fetch-me-12-boar-tusks or climb a tower to unlock the map but rather meander into more interesting stories and take you to gorgeous hidden spots with their own unique challenges that I'd never have found on my own.There's something to be said about games that rely on replaying the same level more than once to get the full story but honestly, this game never felt lazy for a second, which is something that's very difficult to achieve in open world games because after the gaming industry has evolved to where it stands today, we've come to have very high expectations and it doesn't take that much to break our enjoyment anymore. Yet, in Nier: Automata, everywhere I looked, everytime I prod in an unintended direction, every tire I kicked, I could see the evidence of the passionate artists who licked every surface and facet with madenning attention to detail.Lastly, there're a few technical issues with full screen performance and the hacking minigame controls using kb/m right now but I expect those to ironed out and there are already community fixes available. Generally, the game run perfectly on my aging 780ti.Rock solid 8/10.			"

												FIX FOR CRASHES / LAGOn laptops with multiple Graphics Cards ensure the stronger one is set to default, for some reason Nier was using my intel default one instead of my Nvidia.Game runs beautifully now and reminds me so much of Kingdom Hearts hack and slash, really impressed.Old Review:Running an Intel(R) Core i7 - 5700 HQ CPU @ 2.70, 16Gb RAM with a bloody 970x on my PC. Drivers are all updated (tried as fix for game) and the game is unplayable at the moment due to unrelentlingly slow frame rate.It took 20 minutes to get past the intro flight scene due to the settings which I tried on High, Medium, and Low with no result. The flight scene was atleast completable with serious desync of voices to game, and once on the first hand to hand combat it became completely unplayable.As a side note I preloaded the night prior and the unpacking of the game took 3x as long as the download did which is odd. I have a 15Mps internet speedWill check back in a few days to see if a patch is put out but as of now I can not recommend.			"

This doesn't however, change the framerate issues w/ cutscenes and hiccups in game performance. HIgher tier graphics cards (97+/10xx) are imperative for any sort of performance boost above what's already present on the PS4 ver.

												I got this game on day one and was hoping it would be awesome and in no way has it let me down yet. I am absolutely loving it so far and the story has actually got me questioning my actions in the game. every moment is a wtf moment and the switch up of genre in game makes it so friggin intense especially at the boss stages. bullet hell,top down, side scrolling, flight, rpg, hack n slash and more. Its worthy of the praise ive seen so far even if the graphics arent on par with those of todays games its no big deal as graphics dont make a game great they just act as a bonus. Its also a massive change of pace from all these first person horrors and shooters and survival games coming out. if i was rating it id give it 9/10 in my opinion. but then nothing is perfect. I would say buy and see for yourself and if not then you can always get a refund. Oh and for the voice acting sometimes its lacking but over all its pretty good and there is many side quests worth doing to boost your character. As i said give it a bash.			"

												In a few words, this game is amazing.Fun Hack n' Slash gameplay with tight controls, very difficult and unforgiving game, mainly so in the prologue, I don't recommend starting it on hard, it's a game that, unless you're used to the genre you should start in Normal or easier, if you're absolutely incompetent, don't worry, the game can be very accessive by enabling chips that basically play the game for you.The story, though, now that's the thing, this game has 5 true endings, unlike other games you don't start the game all the way over to get the different endings, each and every play through is truly different from the previous one, either by introducing a different playable character or more story elements, so if you're afraid of getting burned out by starting a new game+, don't be, try it out first, it's a whole new thing.This game can be very depressing, be it via the main story or it's side quests. Sometimes it will throw you something that gives you hope, but most of the time, it will try to crush you, make you question your existence and objectives and I love it. This game said something that I've always thought about, it connected to me in a very deep level, so I hanged on, 'till the very last true ending, ending E......that ending really gives you hope to keep on, no matter how hard it gets.Oh, and to the person who I gave up all my time and effort to help! Life can be quite the ♥♥♥♥♥, it might be meaningless and you will suffer a lot, but so what? Memory wasn't made for us to remember or good times, it's there so we don't repeat our mistakes. Suffering and hardship makes us stronger, if we can get past it! Time is only wasted if you think it is, when you do the things you love, that isn't wasted time, nah, that's called 'time well spent'.So struggle, scream, cry and fight, even if it's all really meaningless and futile, because isn't it fun, to hang on to this tiny hope, to deny when life it says to give up, to fight the impossible? I know I love it and I wouldn't have it any other way, so hang on, I'm here with you, even if you think you're alone.			"

												I originally reviewed this game after beating the first playthrough. I've now completed all the main endings so I feel I can give a more accurate review.NieR: Automata is the story of androids 2B, A2 and 9S as they struggle to understand what's going on in a world infested with machine lifeforms. Platinum Games had a heavy involvement and as you'd expect, the combat system is extremely well thought out and fluid. While occasionally the camera can be a bit problematic, generally the game plays very well as it switches between action RPG hack-and-slash and various shooter/bullet hell genres.The initial play through (Route A) takes around 10 hours if you ignore some of the sidequests. After its completion, the game will tell you that the game is expected to be played a few times through for different endings. I would strongly suggest playing through Endings A to E; the remaining ones are largely joke ones.The music by MONACA and Keiichi Okabe is amazing throughout and perfectly captures the atmosphere of vain hope and sadness that resonates throughout the main story.The real strong point of the game is the story and the emotional attachments you forge with the characters, which makes the different story routes all the more impactful. Without spoiling anything, you want to be aware that this is a pretty hard-hitting game and it's almost as if Yoko Taro delights in making the player suffer.To anyone considering the game, please at least play Routes A, B and then C/D/E (the latter three don't take long). Only then will you fully understand what's going on in the world. By just completing A and B (like many magazine/websites have), you barely get to know anything.The PC port has some issues (1080p actually just upscales 900p so it looks blurry unless you use a Borderless Window program) and it can sometime drop frames / stutter / freeze briefly even on good machines. Once these are sorted out, it'll leave a game that I consider to be a real contender for one of the greatest games ever.Genuinely, I haven't played a game this good in years and thoroughly recommend it...if you're prepared for being hit right in the feels, over and over again.Amazing game.

												In the past couple of years I have played plenty of games, watched plenty of series and movies as well as spending plenty of time with my lads. After 5 years time this game reminded me what it is to enjoy a game. A game that is immersive, a story that is interesting yet sad. A combat system that is fluent. A grinding system that knows its limit so that you won't spend decades in the search of one item and the soundtracks... those are a masterpiece. There are plenty of games with better graphics, better effects, a better story, better sounds, but do they all have these great aspects in a single game? If it weren't for Witcher 3 and GTA V I'd call this game the most complete and finished product that has been created in the past 5 years. It reminded me once again what it is to enjoy games.Luckily enough my setup can handle this game at max settings without any resolution bugs or whatsoever. There are some players experiencing some issues, but that shouldn't stop you from trying this game as the person behind it is a genius that you will encounter rarely in the gaming industry. For the given issues there are plenty of work arounds. I talk about the content as this game is easily spoiled, but the trailers show you a fraction of what is waiting for you once you purchase this divine product.			"

CONS:-Annoying little jap-man in a boy body screamming every chance he gets, weak ♥♥♥ male character.-Dev hired a stupid programmer to design the saveable spots, lost 30 mins each time you die in the tower.9S and 2B first 2 endings could be combined to play at the same time, dev should give player that option, instead of playing the same story twice just to play it once as 2B and once at 9S.Sometimes hacking feels a little overused, otherwise it's enjoyable, fun to play.Recommendation? Yes, but not at full price, wait for a sale.			"

												By far one of the best games I've had the pleasure of playing. I love the world that Yoko Taro created and am currently getting through my second full-game playthrough. As you play it, you can tell that the game was made with a lot of thought and care. The world feels lived in, and the way that the story unravels always leaves you wanting to continue. Positives: + Phenomenal Soundtrack+ Incredible in-game atmosphere from the get-go+ Amazing gameplay mechanics (Thank you Platinum Games)+ Compelling storyline and charactersNegatives:- Some players report frame-rate hiccups (try the unofficial patches!)- Some questing can take a long time (large maps to run back and forth through early on)Give it a shot if and when you get the chance!

												Combat is nice and quick.  The genre blending throughout is a delight.  Aesthetics is where this game really shines.  Visually it is very stylish, but what it does with videogame story telling is it's real strength.  If you enjoy science fiction with a philosphical bent, you will love what this game does.I actually found myself feeling bad at times for the enemies I had to kill.  Like this was just a big misunderstanding, a breakdown in communication.  This has happened even for the run-of-the-mill cannon fodder enemies.  No game I have ever played has accomplished evoking that.Word of warning though: this game requires multiple play throughs.  However, mercifully, it doesn't make you hunt for things to change.  I'm not somebody who likes playing the same content multiple times, but I've been enjoying doing it in this game because it does such a good job of building up the different characters through the playthroughs (you play as a different character on the other play throughs).Unfortunately this game suffers from performance issues.  There is a fan patch that helps correct these, you can find more info here: https://steamcommunity.com/app/524220/discussions/0/135512104777399045/ "

On the suface this game is a fun and emotional hack and slash, platformer, topdown, bullet hell. but if you look deeper it is a story about self and what is the dividing line of human.

												This game is absolutely amazing from start to finish. I cannot recommend this game enough. Hopefully this game sells well enough to warrant a direct sequel or a remaster of any of the older nier or drakengard games. Now lets talk about the pros and the cons.Pros:1.) amazing soundtrack2.) good character development3.) combat is fun and engaging4.) Lots of variety in ways you play (hack and slash, bullet hell parts, etc.)5.) Absolutely amazing story6.) cool boss fights7.) Plugin and pod program system is vast and impressive8.) References to the original nier (a plus in my book :D)When you start the game on your 3rd playthrough, it becomes a completely different game. The story and feel moments absolutely steal the show.Cons:1.) Shoddy PC port (white screen crashes a frequent for people, Full screen bug that plagues almost everyone, frame rates dip to sub 30 in story heavy cinematics, etc.)2.) Really bad object and terrain pop-ins. No matter what version of the game you have, you'll just be walking and then a building finally decides to fully render itself.3.) Unimpressive textures. Some of the textures in this game are not great. The game suffers from alot of texture baking4.) Some people report on game breaking bugs that make it impossible for them to continue the game. I haven't experienced these issues personally, but to not at least mention them as a possibility would be a disservice to what I would consider an honest review.5.) 1 Boss in particular (no spoilers obviously) is just a big bullet hell scene. While the fight is still kinda cool, its still a little disappointing and comes off as lazy boss design.6.) Its a yoko taro game, so expect plenty of depressing and sad moments. (i put it as a con because depressing scenes arent really my thing) This game will make you care for its characters, and it will make you cry.If you can look past the bad pc port or get your hands on a ps4/ps4 pro copy of the game, play this game. You would be doing yourself a great disservice to gaming if you at least didn't try it. I fully recommend you play through the game multiple times, however. The story changes each time you play through it, revealing more of the story, from a different characters perspective. If you want to fully grasp the story of this game and its universe, you need to play through the game at least 3 times. If you haven't already, then you need to buy and play this game. Its that good, I promise. "

												Pretty sure one, if not THE most brilliant examples of narrative and story telling.Not nearly as convoluted and cryptic as other titles, but rather straightforward (which IMHO does not detract from the experience whatsoever).Yoko Taro pretty much put a sequel to the game, within the game, which hits you like a truck. The story, themes and relationships in the game are so open to interpretation and so blurry, that in itself pushes the narrative. Initially I had doubts about the pacing and sidequests, but everything came full circle towards the end and ends up making alot of sense.If you can look past a few flaws otherwise, you will be rewarded with one of the most emotional and meta experiences out there. The sequence towards end of route E is magical. An example for such a flaw would be, that the gameplay is not a 10/10.In terms of controls: I played this on a steam controller and did not have any issues whatsoever with either the technical or layout aspect of things.The game has replay value, because playing through it again after you know everything of the story, you will notice alot of subtleties you missed before. Also ontop of that you will get chapter select, debug modes etc to finish 100% and test things.Oh did I mention this has the best OST of anything out there, hands down? Because its has.Every track has different versions and while they're all extremely solid on their own, what makes the game is the perfect blend and crossfade between different songs and versions, it almost works like a sort of Leitmotif. The ambience absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing nails it.'Weight of the World', which is the closing/main theme, has 4 different versions IIRC that you will all get to hear throughout the game, until a final epic version that will blow your mind (and tearducts).This is the first time I considered buying a gaming OST, even though its 60 Euros.Short version: If you like story and narrative, BUY THE GAME and give them enough money for a story DLC.P.S: 2B = 2Booty			"

												On my first 'playthrough', I found this game to be rather odd. On my second 'playthrough', I found it to be rather frustrating but nonetheless intriguing.On my third 'playthrough', I have come to the conclusion that this game is freaking insane. I don't understand this at all. what on earth type of drugs is the creator taking? The end isn't the end, the beginning isn't at the beginning. I don't even know who is the main character, I am starting to wonder if up is up and down is down. I can't tell you you'll love the game. it's strange, it can be frustrating, it can be tough at times, and annoying at other times. There have been times where I was just feeling sick of it and to think if I hadn't come back to it for a third 'playthrough'... I would have missed some really major stuff! This game take a LOT of risks. I think a lot of people will be turned off it before they get to find out some of the crazy stuff, such as... the end is not the end. How to recommend it.... it's made by platinum, the people who made Bayonetta and metal gear rising, so the action is good. The music is lovely, if not a little repetitive. The visuals are muted, but there is some lovely effects in there. I mean, some people might think it looks dull. personally I like it. maybe it could have more colour in it. The story... I really don't know. there is all sorts of stuff in there. you can play through it once and feel like you got a complete story, but then if you keep on digging and play again, and again, it unfolds into something far far deeper. I recommend this because... It's kept my attention despite its shortfalls.			"

												This game has a beautiful story, a wonderful soundtrack, and fun gameplay mechanics. The only draw back for me is the fiddly settings in regards to the screen and screen resolution. However, there have been community forums made that address and resolve those issues.I'm a big fan of this franchise and this was just another fantastic addition to it.I would actually love it if Steam could release PC versions of all the previous games.

												Holy crap what can I say about this game.First off, just the gameplay.  It goes from a hack and slash to a arcade style shoot-em-up to a mech fighting game and then to a side scroller and then top down game.It makes even the most routine fighting scenes immensly entertaining.Second, the story.  I'm not going to go into much detail because the amount of twists and turns and moments that just make you pause the game to sit and think for a little are all the little things that just make this game great.All in all, if you are looking for something different but will keep you coming back, get this game.

												So after beating the game (Completing all the main endings) I have to say that this has been the most fun I've had in a game for a while. From the smooth transition from attacks with different weapons (animations are on point from the start of the attack to recovering from a swing) to the hectic bullet-hell sections with constant views. Although I wish there were more bosses but every one we got was fantastic. Even the story although slow at some points kept me engaged and interested to the end. There are some small quirks with the game (frame rate drops between some cinematic parts. When shifting camera angles, movement controls go a little wonky. But nothing gamebreakinig that I have encountered. Overall this game was a blast to play and highly recommend to everyone to play.For the dark souls players try hard mode. From the first mins of the game it will force you to ""git gud"". And the bosses are easily the stars (outside of 2b,9s and A2) of this game. By far the final boss is the best encounter of any game I have played in a long time and shows how platinum games has beautifully combine all the mechanics to give us a satisfying fight.			"

												I'm usually one of those people that doesn't care about the stories and video games. I play games for the gameplay. Nier: Automata's story really left an impression on me. The story itself was good but it gained real impact from how it was told. I wasn't just watching something or reading something, I felt like an active participant in the narrative. It was an incredible experience.The gameplay is great and controls well.  The music is excellent and really enhances the tone of the story. Each area in the small open world uses strong visual designs and apart from the desert, which looks like a desert, I never grew tired of having to move through them.Overall, this game is one of my top gaming experiences.I also witnessed the best version of Romeo & Juliet as conceived by machines.

												Loved the original Nier (Gestalt/Replicant) on Ps3, coming from that Nier Automata is an improvement in gameplay.Music which is a major point alongside story pushes Nier Automata beyond what you mostly play.The story takes you into one view at a time, you learn about the current character you're playing, the choices and paths this character takes..Just to be plunged into another characters point of view upon completion of the 'Prologue'.Once done with this new characters point of view and story, you actually begin the real 'Story'.This makes the game very deep and lets the player connect the lines between what's going on and keeps you curious on what to come.The animations are very fluid in combat, the artstyle very pleasant.The graphics are not at the very top end, but aint something you'd scoff off either.For the small flaws it has (mainly technical) you can actually aquire fixes from the community side of steam of Nier, like adding dualshock 4 buttons when using a DS4, or graphical corrections with a small fix.Overall the game is very story driven, with lots of side content and interesting character development.Has quite a bit of unexpected events and will not care about your feelings or connections, it will deliver the story no matter if it leaves you sad or happy in the end.While i haven't ordered any OST for any game apart from Nier Gestalt, this is now my second OST for a game i own.. Let that be a telling factor about the soundtrack.[EDIT]: So the game description says partial controller support, it actually has full controller support, i suggest you play this with a controller of your choice.It needs a keyboard to type in your savegame file name, thus the partial controller.Love the game to bits, 9/10 from me, will stay with me for a long time ^_^ Thank you Yoko Taro and Platinum Games!

It's hard to say, well really anything about this game without it being spoilers so I'll just say these two things.1: After the initial crazyness the game feels like it slows down to a crawl and you'll probably ask yourself if you even want to keep playing it. Follow the main questline until you're done with desert area. Don't give up before then, it will only take you a few hours at most.2: Make sure you don't stop the first time you see the credits roll. You aren't even half way done. Keep playing, it gets even better after your first credits.			"

												Feels hit me like a freight train I then rode for 10 hours, even though I could have gotten off, I didn't want to. The story is on a level of complexity I have never seen in a video game and even books. You become emotionally attached to characters you may initially feel distant from. You will be provoked into thought of what it is to be human, to have emotions and feelings, and the meaning behind them.NieR:Automata is, without a doubt in my mind, the best game I have ever played.10/10 Would cry to ending credits again.

												There are some definite technical issues that pretty much every other review has discussed, but with my i7 6700k, 970, and 16gigabutts of RAM I'm able to run the game at 60FPS with most of the gwafix options at second highest, shadows at medium, and motion blur off (it makes me sick, no idea if it actually effects performance since I keep it off). The fullscreen 1920x1080 bug sucks, but I didn't really notice it until going into the Steam overlay and there's a borderless windowed program you can use that makes it properly run at 1920x1080.Now as for the game, I went in with my expectations fairly low since I really didn't care for the demo when I tried it on PS4. Maybe it's because I'm now two feet from the screen instead of an entire room lengths away so now I can see everything a lot better, but it was a lot more enjoyable now than it was before. The bullet-hell segments are really fun and make you feel badass and the combat feels smoother than I remember it being. It's also a really pretty game, the first level doesn't really show it due to the entire color pallet being rusty reds and browns, but the city ruins afterwards looks really nice with the dull-ish greys of the ruins with the vibrant greens of the forest that's growing over everything. Music is top notch and is definitely something that I'd listen to outside of the game. While she didn't compose it, the music really reminds me of Yuki Kajiura's work for whatever reason so if you've enjoyed her stuff (Madoka, Fate/Zero, SAO, .Hack//Sign as examples) then you'll probably like Automata's music as well.the valve accessory you get in the Day One Edition is surprisingly cute and its vibrant red color fits really well with 2B's entirely white and black attire.ALSO F I S H I N GTHE ULTIMATE OF ALL VIDEO GAME THINGS			"

												Really awesome game right here.I would go on to tell you how great it is BUT it is blatenly obvious to me that this is a really bad port. It feels and looks like a console game on my rig, which is brand new with a gtx 1070. Therefore i will just skip the detailed review and go into the technichal aspect of the game right away, since i know that that is what really matters here. For me, and for a lot of others alike.The game made a really bad first impression when i realized that you can't play it fullscreen, or i was unable to figure out how. Guess that's a possibility. BUT it should be made so that it is easily played in fullscreen. On top of that, everything was set to either middle or low specs by default. Again, bad first impression. Once in game i notice pop ins and severe problems with shadows on trees. The game does look good, but the pop ins and weird shadows make it really hard to enjoy it. Which sucks since the combat is amazing, but not only the combat. The game made a really good first impression gameplay wise in general. So all in all a great game, but the poor optimization will turn you off if you are easily annoyed by things like that. I hope the devs fix this, the fullscreen issue especially. I will still rate this game positive however. But i will come back to turn it around if i do not see positive change.			"

												Like many other I had to deal with the fullscreen bug, but once I worked around that I was able to enjoy this game without any other issues. Gameplay is great the shifts in perspective, from 3d to 2d sidescroller and 2d overhead at first are pretty neat, right now my only issue with the game is the cutscenes being locked at 30 and it being jittery if CS were at 60 hell even 45 with the gameplay itself locked at 60 i wouldnt mind it allAs for that fullscreen bug the fix depends on what type of gpu you have I have a rx480 so my fix was to roll back to pre relive drivers which are 16.11.5 and I also play in windowed mode but theres a 3rd party program called borderless gaming that i use to play 1920x1080 borderless and it runs great.

												Pretty terrible if you use a keyboard.  Since lock on can't be bound to any mouse buttons, you're stuck awkwardly moving your finger back and forth from one of your movement keys to hold down lock on.  Aiming is also a bit finicky, but you should pick up a controller and enjoy this game.  Gameplay is amazing, and it feels very smooth.  This game is not for the faint of heart.  You cannot just save this game any time you want.  There are specifics locations you can do it, which is a key feature of the game.  So SAVE OFTEN.  It will be a very challenging game.  It took me about 2 hours before I could even reach the first save point, but it did take me a bit to get used to the controls.  I would recommend buying this game if you like a challenge, but playing with keyboard and mouse right now is pretty much impossible.			"

												So far seems very good, a final fantasy type of RPG with regularly changing combat modes from top down shooter to 'Devil May Cry-esque' to 'Einhander' & 'Starfox'The Good:  Playing for about an hour and a half now, and I've played ""bullet-hell"" style shooting sequences alongside a well put together 3rd-person beat-em-up sequences, the changing perspectives and styles flow pretty well and keep things interesting.  Gameplay looks great at solid 60fps 2K with a GTX 1070, and I'm looking forward to dumping alot of time into this game! The not-so-good:  Many cutscenes stutter pretty badly and cut the framerate to 30fps.  I would prefer unlocked framerates, and some of the nice scenic cutscenes that do play at 60fps are hampered by transluscent black bars at the top and bottom of the screen...I also think the 3rd person 'DMC' mode could pull the camera out a bit, it makes for a kind of claustrophobic battle in some areas, though when the view pulls out for side-scroller and flight I think it's perfect.

												I rarely buy games on launch day but after seeing the glowing reviews on PS4 and there was also a discount running on Green Man Gaming I figured why not? TLDR is that it's a fun game but as a PC port it is SO-SO. Pros - Fun  and varied gameplay, cool art direction, English and Japanese VO, sexy charactersCons - Full screen 1080p doesn't work for me, XBone controller didn't work first few times then magically worked after restarting the game a few times. Gameplay runs smooth but cutscenes are capped at a lower framerate. Camera can get funky sometimes. Screen tearing even with vsync on. Game is capped at 60 but that's no biggie for me. WTF - Can't save the game until you get past the prologue. Some gameply settings are unavailable until you start a game. You would think that the prologue would be the part that has any tutorials but those come after you get past the prologue.  "

Boss fights are fun and fast paced, none of that slow thinking stuff, you're constantly avoiding ranged  attacks and moving which makes the game really fun to play.I prefer japanese voice but english isn't terrible like they usually are.Performance seems variable to everyone but for me it's smooth at x2 AA and other settings turned up. Game seems to take more load on GPU than CPU so you need something like a GTX 1060/RX 480 to max it out @1080p (I assume since im playing with a GTX 970 with heavy OC and it still struggles to maintain that sweet spot of 60fps at max settings where it hovers around 40-55fps.)

												PC Port is beautiful a bit confusing at first with the controls depending which gameplay mode your character is in at the time. There are occasional frames per second loss depending on how your settings are and your computer runs, This game also requires a lot of hand-eye coordination and memory for combos and tactics on its higher difficulties. The only downside I can say is on easiest mode or easy mode whatever you want to call it the game basically plays for you, which is both amusing and frustrating as it leaves you with little to do playerwise. Now I'm speaking as a fan of the NieR/Drakengard/Drag On Dragoon franchise, a new fan but a fan none the less, this game is glorious, I am such a die-hard fan that you can choose to look over my review because it's very hard for me to find something wrong.

												The game is brilliant but sadly not bug-free.It has completely frozen a few times, requiring the game to be terminated and restarted.Due to the somewhat silly method for game saving, it's a lottery how much progress you will lose when it crashes.There are sections where you cannot save for quite awhile, and should the game decide to crash during that time, it's very frustrating to have to repeat everything.It's not what I expect from an expensive AAA product.However, I still recommend the game for it's beautiful graphics and game world, compelling storyline and fun combat.

												I'm not much for writing reviews, but Nier:Automata deserves every ounce of praise given to it and more.What is it?   -- It is hack/slash RPG with a simple combat system that shows remarkable depth over time.  -- It is a arcady bullet-hell game at times.  -- It is a story driven game that will drive you to tears and heartbreak.  -- It is an open world that begs to be explored and appreciated.   -- It is home to one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard. It is one of the most satisfying games, story and gameplaywise, that I have ever had the experience of playing. If I am to be fair, Nier:Automata is not without its flaws:  -- I had some studdering/fps issues at times even after using Borderless Gaming (which I highly recommend for this game).  -- The keyboard controls (especially dodging) are rather sh*tty, I did not have much choiced but to use a controller.   -- Aiming without a lockout is rather poor.  -- The game can be too easy sometimes, but the difficulty jump between normal and hard is unfair. (Think 5x more damage from all enemies)But all of these flaws are either avoidable or ignorable. They did not ruin the game for me in the slightest.Nier:Automata is a melting pot of various ideas and genres, and successfully manages to combine them while setting itself apart from everything. Yoko Taro created a beautiful world, story, and characters. If I were to compare this game to anything, it would be to a black hole. The game pulled me into its world and never let go until I beat the game. And, mild spoiler:  All the advertised gameplay and campaign is actually a little less than HALF the full story.I apologize. I have been rambling. I don't write reviews well, but I had to try for this game. It touched me and will forever hold a special place in my heart. This is undoubtably, one of the single best games I have ever played. You will not regret buying this game.			"

												It stayed true to its hype. Surely one of the best games i've played.Gameplay 9/10Almost perfect, i'd have preferred a little more flexibility with regards to the controls, especially for keyboard users. The combats are fast paced and inhuman, literally. Graphics 8/10Could've been better optimized for PC. But was able to clock a constant 30 fps with a gtx 1050ti, even at higher frame rates, the game seems, kind of rugged...don't know if it's just me. Story 9/10Ingenious, simply awesome. It could've been narrated better though, my issue is mostly with the flow of the story, seemed kind of discontinuous at certain parts... OST 10/10 Just WOW. The soundtrack is surely a major contributor to the games splendor. Every bgm fits into the situation it is being played. Overall, 9/10. -1 for mostly its substandard narration and lack of interesting side quests( or maybe i haven't discovered them all yet) A strong contender for GOTY.			"

I'm still not done with the game as New Game Plus and New Game Plus Plus (and pontenataly New Game Plus Plus Plus) have diffrent ablilities, story, etc. and I have not once found myself bord while playing. The PC controls are, to put it simply, sh*t and the controls that count cannot be changed (such as doging). I highly recommend the first thing you do is go into the community guides and download a new script to fix this. There are a few plot holes and a few things controdict themselfs, but it overall did not have that big an impact. 9.3/10 would buy again.			"

												When I first started hearing about this game I had only seen a few gameplay videos. I thought, ""This is cool."" Then I started hear praises over the game. But no one would say anything about it other that you need to play it. So I tried the demo on PS4 and loved the combat. So I bought it here on my pc since I dont have a PS4. Instantly fell in love with the game.I was captivated by the atmosphere. Amazing graphics. When I started I said to my friend. ""I know this sounds kinda cheesy, but I love it when a game tries to be fun and a work of art all at the same time.""Fluid animations in-combat and out of combat. Actually loved the voice actors. And to top it off, the soundtrack is the best I've ever heard in a game this far. You know its good when you can listen to it all day at work for 2 weeks straight.As this being my favorite game now I'm giving it 10/10 for everything.Story 10/10Music 10/10Direction 10/10Art Direction 10/10Combat 10/102B's booty 10/109s 9s/10Buy this game and play it with no spoilers. Don't browse reddit or youtube while playing this game. Best played with no knowledge of the world other than the description on steam.This masterpiece was a rollercoaster of emotions for me. I've never had a game get me so emotionally attached to the characters and the stories. Thank you Yoko Taro you beautiful ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. And thank you Square Enix and Platinum Games.Now off to 100% the game and restart on very hard mode :)			"

												This game is absolutely amazing from start to finish. I cannot recommend this game enough. Hopefully this game sells well enough to warrant a direct sequel or a remaster of any of the older nier or drakengard games. Now lets talk about the pros and the cons.Pros:1.) amazing soundtrack2.) good character development3.) combat is fun and engaging4.) Lots of variety in ways you play (hack and slash, bullet hell parts, etc.)5.) Absolutely amazing story6.) cool boss fights7.) Plugin and pod program system is vast and impressive8.) References to the original nier (a plus in my book :D)When you start the game on your 3rd playthrough, it becomes a completely different game. The story and feel moments absolutely steal the show.Cons:1.) Shoddy PC port (white screen crashes a frequent for people, Full screen bug that plagues almost everyone, frame rates dip to sub 30 in story heavy cinematics, etc.)2.) Really bad object and terrain pop-ins. No matter what version of the game you have, you'll just be walking and then a building finally decides to fully render itself.3.) Unimpressive textures. Some of the textures in this game are not great. The game suffers from alot of texture baking4.) Some people report on game breaking bugs that make it impossible for them to continue the game. I haven't experienced these issues personally, but to not at least mention them as a possibility would be a disservice to what I would consider an honest review.5.) 1 Boss in particular (no spoilers obviously) is just a big bullet hell scene. While the fight is still kinda cool, its still a little disappointing and comes off as lazy boss design.6.) Its a yoko taro game, so expect plenty of depressing and sad moments. (i put it as a con because depressing scenes arent really my thing) This game will make you care for its characters, and it will make you cry.If you can look past the bad pc port or get your hands on a ps4/ps4 pro copy of the game, play this game. You would be doing yourself a great disservice to gaming if you at least didn't try it. I fully recommend you play through the game multiple times, however. The story changes each time you play through it, revealing more of the story, from a different characters perspective. If you want to fully grasp the story of this game and its universe, you need to play through the game at least 3 times. If you haven't already, then you need to buy and play this game. Its that good, I promise. "

												Combat is nice and quick.  The genre blending throughout is a delight.  Aesthetics is where this game really shines.  Visually it is very stylish, but what it does with videogame story telling is it's real strength.  If you enjoy science fiction with a philosphical bent, you will love what this game does.I actually found myself feeling bad at times for the enemies I had to kill.  Like this was just a big misunderstanding, a breakdown in communication.  This has happened even for the run-of-the-mill cannon fodder enemies.  No game I have ever played has accomplished evoking that.Word of warning though: this game requires multiple play throughs.  However, mercifully, it doesn't make you hunt for things to change.  I'm not somebody who likes playing the same content multiple times, but I've been enjoying doing it in this game because it does such a good job of building up the different characters through the playthroughs (you play as a different character on the other play throughs).Unfortunately this game suffers from performance issues.  There is a fan patch that helps correct these, you can find more info here: https://steamcommunity.com/app/524220/discussions/0/135512104777399045/ "

												Pretty sure one, if not THE most brilliant examples of narrative and story telling.Not nearly as convoluted and cryptic as other titles, but rather straightforward (which IMHO does not detract from the experience whatsoever).Yoko Taro pretty much put a sequel to the game, within the game, which hits you like a truck. The story, themes and relationships in the game are so open to interpretation and so blurry, that in itself pushes the narrative. Initially I had doubts about the pacing and sidequests, but everything came full circle towards the end and ends up making alot of sense.If you can look past a few flaws otherwise, you will be rewarded with one of the most emotional and meta experiences out there. The sequence towards end of route E is magical. An example for such a flaw would be, that the gameplay is not a 10/10.In terms of controls: I played this on a steam controller and did not have any issues whatsoever with either the technical or layout aspect of things.The game has replay value, because playing through it again after you know everything of the story, you will notice alot of subtleties you missed before. Also ontop of that you will get chapter select, debug modes etc to finish 100% and test things.Oh did I mention this has the best OST of anything out there, hands down? Because its has.Every track has different versions and while they're all extremely solid on their own, what makes the game is the perfect blend and crossfade between different songs and versions, it almost works like a sort of Leitmotif. The ambience absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing nails it.'Weight of the World', which is the closing/main theme, has 4 different versions IIRC that you will all get to hear throughout the game, until a final epic version that will blow your mind (and tearducts).This is the first time I considered buying a gaming OST, even though its 60 Euros.Short version: If you like story and narrative, BUY THE GAME and give them enough money for a story DLC.P.S: 2B = 2Booty			"

I simply couldn't hold my tears back.. So beautiful! I can't even explain it properly.The combat is really fun and smooth and the story line is amazing. I love how many elements there is to discover in the story as you progress the game and slowly find the truth behind everything.

But just add a few corrections, firstly, for more convenience it's better to play on the gamepad, and secondly, on weak machines like mine, it's impossible to play without the FAR mod, to the one who created it, thank you so much, because with him the game is smooth enough for the medium Settings on nvidia gtx 660.Japanese voices so good thet i want to cry.

												Very good, combat has many combos with different weapon types and has many suprises (so many that I was amazingly suprised).

												Feels hit me like a freight train I then rode for 10 hours, even though I could have gotten off, I didn't want to. The story is on a level of complexity I have never seen in a video game and even books. You become emotionally attached to characters you may initially feel distant from. You will be provoked into thought of what it is to be human, to have emotions and feelings, and the meaning behind them.NieR:Automata is, without a doubt in my mind, the best game I have ever played.10/10 Would cry to ending credits again.

												Nier is by no means a perfect game.  It is also not a game for everyone.  However, in todays climate when many video games feel like the mangled birth of corporate decisions, focus groups, market analysis and ultimate desire to only sell units, Nier is a breath of fresh air and definitely something we need more of…Nier is a fun, genre hopping game. One minute you’re in an on-rails shooter, next a twin stick shooter, a few minutes later your smashing it up in Devil May Cry style like it’s going out of fashion.  You might be sliding over sand dunes or riding a boar before you’re thrown into what feels like a 2d platformer, but somehow it doesn’t come off as cheap. There’s more, but I don’t want to spoil… Nier is a thoughtful game, although it might not be as smart as it thinks it is. There’s SO many wonderful and ingenious things about Nier, but I can’t share the, as it would spoil it for you.  It made me think hard, it made me feel for the characters in the conflict, it made me laugh.  It toys with existentialism, fatalism, nihilism and theories on determinalism.  It gives you the tools for unadulterated violence, yet forces you to question the impact of using it. I did see some of the games big reveals a million miles away though.Nier is a weird game.  It forces you to play through its 1st half twice before it really lets you know what’s going on.  It’s also a game where an android asks you to eat a mackerel so it can see what effect it has on you.Nier is an amazing sounding game, and like Hyper Light Drifter, the soundtrack is one of its biggest stars and REALLY adds an amazing texture to everything.Nier is a visually-confused game.  The main characters look pretty silly if you ask me (a prepubescent boy in a blazer and knee high books?  A white-haired French maid who can’t stop flashing her undies?  I guess it doesn't want you to forget for one minute that this is a Japanese game eh?) but they animate incredibly well.  The robots are the real stars though, with a very studio Ghibli vide, and some of the bosses are amazing.  However, the game world itself is blocky, unimaginative and has some very poor textures that make me wonder if this was designed for the PS2 or not.  I never thought I’d see a modern game with uglier environments than Tales of Zestira, but here we go.Nier is sometimes a frustrating game, with one boss in particular being annoying in the extreme, and trying to find upgrade materials being a huge pain.  it also gives you a lot of fetch quests.Finally, Nier is a unique game that always kept me on my toes and looking forward to what would come next in temrs of both sotry an gameplay.  Aside from the combat, there is NOTHING like this on the PC.  Its not perfect, but it is thoughtful, inventive, and ultimately giving the player something different from the 999th open world icon collect-athon bore fest or the 999th indie retro pixel rogue like alike. For that I think it might be worth your time.  I usually only buy one full-priced game a year, and I’m glad I chose this over Mass Effect androgynous 😊.  So far, Nier is my top game of 2017			"

												It nice to see a game in this generation of AAA titles that wont hold your hand. The game has no auto save feature. The save system reminds me of the classic rpgs of yesteryears. The Graphics are fine even though the game does suffer from poppins and other minor bugs related to draw distnance.The Combat is very good as it  transition from bullet hell, twin stick shooting, 3rd person and 2d side scrolling. games runs smoothly for me powered buy an I7 4790, 24gb ddr3 ram and a gtx1070. There does seem to be a resoultion glithes as 1440p seems just a tad fuzzy to me. I have not run into any game breaking bugs and zero crashes in the 17 hours I played. I would also suggest using a gamepad over a keyboard in mouse with this title, due to the differnt game types mesh in this gameEdit As much as I enjoy this game have to change my recommendation due to lack of patches to fix performace issues. will change back my recommendation once game gets patch/fix.

												Okay, if this game doesn't get ""Overwhelmingly positive"" in a few weeks I'm gonna be mad.Seriously now, the game is a masterpiece. And what I mean by masterpiece is TRULY a masterpiece. Like Jim Sterling said: ""if history forgets this game, then ♥♥♥♥ history"". It's up to us to remember this game, and I will remember it on all of its glory.This game should be played by every person that appreciates playing videogames. It is a work of art, on all of its factors. The scenery, the combat mechanics, THE STORY! It immerses you to a point where you believe to be truly an android. THE ENDINGS ARE COUNTLESS, the main story endings are 5, with ending E being the ""true ending"" but I enjoyed every part of every single ending, and then there is like 21 more joke endings to complete the game. Believe me when I say this: THE STORY IS ONE OF THE BEST I HAVE EVER PLAYED.The soundtrack deserves its own paragraph. I said previously that the story of this game is ONE of the BEST. Well, truly believe me when I say, the soundtrack is THE BEST I HAVE LISTENED TO, PERIOD.10/10 game for me. GOTY all the way.			"

												This game is a modern masterpiece.I've never experienced a game that blends gameplay genres as smoothly as this does -- it honestly feels like a breakthrough in gaming. Video clips can't do it justice and, even worse, can make it seem gimmicky. But when you experience it for yourself, it seems so effortless and natural that you'll wonder why no other game has ever been able to pull it off. The combat animations have a ridiculous level of detail, yet the control responsiveness is unmistakably Platinum Games. Everything is tight and fluid and intuitive.The soundtrack is, quite frankly, unforgettable. It adds so much to the experience, and the dynamic layering is perfectly done. Words can't do it justice.The story and themes are mature and deep, and you'll be thinking about it long after you finish. The final act is among the most exciting and satisfying experiences I've ever had with a game.This game has 5 canon endings (ABCDE) and you haven't played the full game until you've seen them all.

												It stayed true to its hype. Surely one of the best games i've played.Gameplay 9/10Almost perfect, i'd have preferred a little more flexibility with regards to the controls, especially for keyboard users. The combats are fast paced and inhuman, literally. Graphics 8/10Could've been better optimized for PC. But was able to clock a constant 30 fps with a gtx 1050ti, even at higher frame rates, the game seems, kind of rugged...don't know if it's just me. Story 9/10Ingenious, simply awesome. It could've been narrated better though, my issue is mostly with the flow of the story, seemed kind of discontinuous at certain parts... OST 10/10 Just WOW. The soundtrack is surely a major contributor to the games splendor. Every bgm fits into the situation it is being played. Overall, 9/10. -1 for mostly its substandard narration and lack of interesting side quests( or maybe i haven't discovered them all yet) A strong contender for GOTY.			"

												I don't really write reviews but NieR:Automata has compelled me to write one. I am at a lack of words to describe this game. But, I also want people to know how important this game is for me and for gaming itself. Nier:Automata takes chances, tries to do something different and compeletely succeeds in doing so. Have you felt a void, the void that you feel when you finish a great game, a great novel, a great movie. The premonition that you will never again have this experience again, that is the feeling I got after finishing Nier. I was genuinely sad that it has ended. There are few games that tell thier story more through gameplay than through cutscenes, Yoko Taro, the director of Nier:Automata has created one such masterpiece where every second of gamepaly is an experience that the player never forgets, mainly through the fluid fighting system, interesting RPG elements, interesting characters and amazing music. Infact I would like to stress the fact that music in Nier:Automata is simply the best videogame soundtrack ever created and soundtrack itself is worth paying full price for the game. As for the story you play as an android, which are robots that are basically human in the way they think and act, but they are not really human as well. This is the main agenda for the story do these androids have a will of their own or the machines they are fighting do they have feelings or are they just imitating humans. Not only this is a story of the androids 2B, 9S and A2 but also of the enemies they are fighting."" Souls and heaven, huh? Do either of those things exist?"""" They will find out in the end. And so will we. "" I don't want to say more about the story except that the story keeps on becoming more engaging and tragic as the game progresses, enough to keep you glued to finish the game 3 times to compeletely know the story. Each time you play the game you learn something new about the world and about the characters, though I do admit that 2nd playthrough of Nier:Automata is kind of subdued as compared to the first and third playthrough but is still very entertaining. Nier:Automata like Dark Souls 1 and The Witcher 3 is a masterpiece that will be rememberd for years to come for setting new standards in gaming. It is an outstanding work of art too important be ignored by any gamer.			"

												Very good, combat has many combos with different weapon types and has many suprises (so many that I was amazingly suprised). Real issue I found is that the shooting mechanic is the sidescrolling sections seems to put movement above the direction your mouse was pointing as it constantly returned to shooting forward, which can be very annoying during some segments.

												JESUS play this game!!!!! Also I bought this game primarily because I was super gay for some android booty, but i quickly forgot all about that and got lost in the story and lore which kept me going back to replay sidequests and make sure I hadnt missed a single detail about the characters. And there is PLENTY of details to speculate about. It's legitimately one of the best Jrpgs I have played in a long time. It's far from perfect. But its story that questions the morality of being alive and its beautiful artwork and interesting game mechanics and quirks are what make it truely special. 9/10 and I only subtract a point because I cried for like 2 days straight after the best possible ending and at this very moment im still recovering from it.

												I've never really written a review, but finishing this game made me. Even though it will have the structural integrity of a 5th grader's first essay, I feel like it's something I have to do. Because if it means I'll give at least one person the final nudge to buy this game, it'll mean the world to me. The combat was fun and intuitive, the soundtrack was a masterpiece, and the story and the way the game concluded, was something I can't really describe. This game was an amazing experience, despite me having to play it on 800x600 because my pc is trash. I honestly don't think I've ever played something as great as this title. This game is an action packed, emotional rollercoaster with a little bit of philosophical thought. You'll want to get off Yoko Taro's Wild Ride, but he won't let you. No. He'll strap you in, lube you up, put on his elbow-length latex glove and show you how deep the rabbit holegoes. The ending will get you. All of the endings will get you. And when the vocals kick in, you WILL cry little b*tch tears. This game isn't like other games. This game shows you the ugly but also the beautiful. It's cruel, yet cheerful at times. Hopeless yet hope-filled. I recommend this with all my heart.A massive thank you to the director, the developers, and everyone who was behind this game. You're gonna carry that weight of the world.

I'm still not done with the game as New Game Plus and New Game Plus Plus (and pontenataly New Game Plus Plus Plus) have diffrent ablilities, story, etc. and I have not once found myself bord while playing. The PC controls are, to put it simply, sh*t and the controls that count cannot be changed (such as doging). I highly recommend the first thing you do is go into the community guides and download a new script to fix this. There are a few plot holes and a few things controdict themselfs, but it overall did not have that big an impact. 9.3/10 would buy again.			"

												If you're an average RPG/hack and slash gamer, the first thing you want to know is this game has 26 endings over multiple NG+ cycles.I can't recommend this game enough. I bought NieR:A because I was a fan of Drakengard and I expected the same kind of RPG action. It delivers a lot more than that. I feel like the advertising is a bit misleading and doesn't do it justice for how polished it actually is. I was very skeptical, but after the end of the first mission I wasn't having any regrets.The vast majority of the game is presented in third person - but in typical fashion, the start of the game bends genres in nods toward Galaga and Einhander type air battles, as well as side scrolling platforming and twin-stick shooting. It pulls this off just by changing the camera angle and I found that to be quite satisfying. In fact, there's a ton of things that end up being strangely satisfying, like the end of 2B's walking animation if you just nudge the analog stick slightly.In a world full of half-baked games, this one will stand out. The story is tragically heavy at times and surprised me with how much sadness it could wrench out of me (who's an emotional blank slate) with just a single scene. It hits all the marks.NieR:Automata delivers. Absolutely worth it at full price.			"

I do not like J-RPGs, they seem too focused in leveling up a mindless number, have weak stories from a character development point, and just... those gimmicks for horny dudes. For years I have avoided a large part of the games tailored from japan because of all of this and just Dark Souls has recently got through my kind of ""barrier"" for games that I like, and this game is not Dark Souls, but oh my god, it is a beautiful game.Here you will be surprised. Continuously. The plot deepens every minute you spend on it, the combat evolves occasion after occasion and... well, I don't want to spoil it for you, but you're going to find yourself thinking about the mind of a soldier, the importance of humanity and, in the end, of life itself. Not trying to be pretentious, but I dare you to get to the end of the game without at least thinking once or twice about something deep that matters to you.If I can say something that is important to me about this game is that you will not be the same after playing Nier Automata.

A breath of fresh airNieR : Automata is a great expansion to the universe created by Yoko Taro that has been portrayed through first Drakengard and prequel to Automata - original NieR game.As long as your expectation is not oriented purely towards graphics or technical aspects, Automata delivers both great story and gameplay thanks to cooperation between Yoko Taro and Platinum games.Thanks to this alliance, great story has been given an adequate vessel allowing players to experience the world of NieR without getting bored, frustrated or tired.Story:Let's make it clear - if you're reading this, with a precision of approximately 99,95% i can tell you're a fellow weaboo.If you know Neon Genesis Evangelion, you'll feel right at home.If by any chance you're also familiar with earlier creations of Yoko Taro, you won't be disappointed - if not, well knowledge of either Drakengard or NieR is not needed to enjoy or understand the game, but some of the references won't connect for you. Veterans will appreciate certain character, references and musical themes.Graphics/Technical aspects:Probably the weakest point of the game. Speaking solely about PC version it's a solid improvement from other Platinum games PC ports although it's still far from perfect.-Visual fidelity is generally on par with console version-60FPS lock-Support for arbitrary resolutions (although only 16:9 aspect ratio works correctly)-Few PC specific features like MSAA or audio mute when out of focus (no borderless windowed mode though)As of writing this review PC version struggles with some issues, some more fatal than others. Besides issues with launching the game on certain GPU/driver configurations to inadequate performance when compared to other games with similar requirements the game works completely fine, once you get it working you can expect solid crash free experience with no FPS drops although unless you own a beefy rig don't expect the ""perfect"" experience.Audio:No letdown here either, music composed by Keiichi Okabe lives up to soundtracks of his previous creations.Official OST has around ~46 tracks although actual amount of music clips in game is easily triple of that count, each track has few different versions based on speed, vocals and even 8-bit remixes. There are even some tracks from original NieR game.GameplayAs expected from Platinum games, it's quick and fluid. Combo system is easy to learn but hard to master. In general you won't be having issues with playing the game on normal mode if you take your time to do side quests.Overall game design is based around ""route"" system with each route giving you different ending out of 5 main endings.This also means that each route is mostly same game played from the start although there many differences between each route, starting from being able to control different character to unlocking availability of different sidequests during each route and ending on uncovering more and more plot with each route beaten. Automata tries to be more than one game at the same time, combining 3D action-slasher with 2d bullethell kind gameplay and topping it up with hacking minigames (and it doesn't end there). All of the mechanics are integral parts of the game and they never overstay they welcome.The good One of most unique games in recent years Adequate execution of Yoko Taro's ideas Great synergy between world building, gameplay and audio Classic Platinum combat mechanicsThe bad Few issues with PC version (with some of them being quite serious) Really raw and simplistic graphics (thankfully art style compensates for crude graphics fidelity) Few areas could use more shortcuts and connections between each other It's easy to get overleveled if you focus on doing all of the side quests Perhaps it could use some more side quests (or i'm just salty that it was over too soon?)Overall i'd give the game a solid 9/10 maybe a 10/10 if it ever gets some more substantial DLCs, patches for PC issues and perhaps even mods to improve upon raw and sterile graphics that were most likely a result of relatively small budgets and targetting for console hardware.

												I'm not much for writing reviews, but Nier:Automata deserves every ounce of praise given to it and more.What is it?   -- It is hack/slash RPG with a simple combat system that shows remarkable depth over time.  -- It is a arcady bullet-hell game at times.  -- It is a story driven game that will drive you to tears and heartbreak.  -- It is an open world that begs to be explored and appreciated.   -- It is home to one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard. It is one of the most satisfying games, story and gameplaywise, that I have ever had the experience of playing. If I am to be fair, Nier:Automata is not without its flaws:  -- I had some studdering/fps issues at times even after using Borderless Gaming (which I highly recommend for this game).  -- The keyboard controls (especially dodging) are rather sh*tty, I did not have much choiced but to use a controller.   -- Aiming without a lockout is rather poor.  -- The game can be too easy sometimes, but the difficulty jump between normal and hard is unfair. (Think 5x more damage from all enemies)But all of these flaws are either avoidable or ignorable. They did not ruin the game for me in the slightest.Nier:Automata is a melting pot of various ideas and genres, and successfully manages to combine them while setting itself apart from everything. Yoko Taro created a beautiful world, story, and characters. If I were to compare this game to anything, it would be to a black hole. The game pulled me into its world and never let go until I beat the game. And, mild spoiler:  All the advertised gameplay and campaign is actually a little less than HALF the full story.I apologize. I have been rambling. I don't write reviews well, but I had to try for this game. It touched me and will forever hold a special place in my heart. This is undoubtably, one of the single best games I have ever played. You will not regret buying this game.			"

												The game is brilliant but sadly not bug-free.It has completely frozen a few times, requiring the game to be terminated and restarted.Due to the somewhat silly method for game saving, it's a lottery how much progress you will lose when it crashes.There are sections where you cannot save for quite awhile, and should the game decide to crash during that time, it's very frustrating to have to repeat everything.It's not what I expect from an expensive AAA product.However, I still recommend the game for it's beautiful graphics and game world, compelling storyline and fun combat.

												one of the best game I have played these years. Worth the money even just for its great soundtrack, The world and the characters are very well depicted and the storyline is very complete (if you went through the game until the true ending)			"

												I was looking to be patient and not write a bad review for what seems like a good game but nearly three weeks have passed and I and many other are not able to even get through the prologue.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME until these glaring issues are finally fixed.			"
